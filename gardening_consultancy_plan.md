# Plant Guide Generation Project
## Scientific Consultancy with Prof. Bill Shipley

### 🌿 PROJECT VISION
Transform Ellenberg indicators into practical gardening knowledge for thousands of plants, making scientific ecology accessible to gardeners worldwide.

## The Business Case for Prof. Shipley

### Why This Matters (Beyond Academia)
- **Impact**: Millions of gardeners making better planting decisions
- **Scale**: From 14,835 scientific species to 50,000+ garden varieties
- **Legacy**: His methods directly improving biodiversity and garden success rates
- **Consultancy Benefits**: Real-world application, potential licensing, ongoing royalties

### The Pitch to Shipley
"Professor Shipley, I'm building a system to generate scientifically-validated plant guides for thousands of species. Your 2017 trait-to-habitat model is the foundation, but I need your expertise to:
1. Validate predictions for horticultural species
2. Translate Ellenberg scores to gardening requirements
3. Ensure causal relationships hold for cultivated plants
4. Build confidence intervals for practical recommendations"

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Prediction Model
```r
# Shipley-validated model for garden plants
library(piecewiseSEM)

# Base model from 2017 paper
base_model <- clm(
  ellenberg ~ SLA + LDMC + leaf_area + seed_mass,
  data = known_species
)

# Enhanced with uncertainty quantification
predict_garden_requirements <- function(species_traits) {
  # Predict Ellenberg scores
  ellenberg_pred <- predict(base_model, species_traits, 
                           type = "prob", interval = "confidence")
  
  # Convert to gardening terms
  garden_reqs <- list(
    moisture = ellenberg_to_watering(ellenberg_pred$M),
    nutrients = ellenberg_to_fertilizer(ellenberg_pred$N),
    pH = ellenberg_to_soil_pH(ellenberg_pred$R),
    light = ellenberg_to_sun_exposure(ellenberg_pred$L),
    hardiness = ellenberg_to_zones(ellenberg_pred$T)
  )
  
  return(garden_reqs)
}
```

### Phase 2: Translation Layer
```r
# Convert Ellenberg to Gardening Language
ellenberg_to_watering <- function(M_score, confidence) {
  watering <- case_when(
    M_score <= 3 ~ list(
      frequency = "Drought tolerant - water deeply but infrequently",
      schedule = "Every 2-3 weeks in summer",
      amount = "1 inch per watering",
      tips = "Excellent for xeriscaping"
    ),
    M_score <= 5 ~ list(
      frequency = "Moderate - regular watering",
      schedule = "Weekly in growing season",
      amount = "1-2 inches per week",
      tips = "Mulch to retain moisture"
    ),
    M_score <= 7 ~ list(
      frequency = "Moisture-loving - keep consistently moist",
      schedule = "2-3 times per week",
      amount = "2-3 inches per week",
      tips = "Good drainage essential to prevent root rot"
    ),
    M_score > 7 ~ list(
      frequency = "Aquatic/Bog - constantly moist to wet",
      schedule = "Daily or standing water",
      amount = "Abundant",
      tips = "Consider rain garden or pond edge"
    )
  )
  
  watering$confidence <- ifelse(confidence > 0.8, "High", 
                                ifelse(confidence > 0.6, "Moderate", "Low"))
  return(watering)
}

ellenberg_to_sun_exposure <- function(L_score, confidence) {
  sun <- case_when(
    L_score <= 3 ~ list(
      exposure = "Full shade",
      hours = "Less than 2 hours direct sun",
      placement = "North side, under dense canopy",
      companions = "Ferns, hostas, astilbe"
    ),
    L_score <= 5 ~ list(
      exposure = "Partial shade",
      hours = "2-4 hours morning sun",
      placement = "East side, woodland edge",
      companions = "Bleeding heart, coral bells"
    ),
    L_score <= 7 ~ list(
      exposure = "Partial sun",
      hours = "4-6 hours direct sun",
      placement = "East or west exposure",
      companions = "Most perennials"
    ),
    L_score > 7 ~ list(
      exposure = "Full sun",
      hours = "6+ hours direct sun",
      placement = "South exposure, open areas",
      companions = "Prairie plants, Mediterranean herbs"
    )
  )
  return(sun)
}
```

### Phase 3: Validation Framework
```r
# Validate predictions with known garden performance
validate_garden_predictions <- function(model, validation_set) {
  # Sources: RHS, USDA, botanical gardens
  validations <- list()
  
  # 1. Check against known garden champions
  garden_champions <- validation_set %>%
    filter(garden_performance == "excellent")
  
  # 2. Validate against hardiness zones
  hardiness_check <- compare_predicted_vs_actual_zones(
    predicted = model$temperature,
    actual = validation_set$USDA_zones
  )
  
  # 3. Check cultivation difficulty predictions
  cultivation_accuracy <- validate_cultivation_difficulty(
    predicted = model$combined_requirements,
    actual = validation_set$RHS_difficulty_rating
  )
  
  return(list(
    champion_accuracy = champion_match_rate,
    zone_correlation = hardiness_check$correlation,
    difficulty_calibration = cultivation_accuracy
  ))
}
```

## The Bigger Picture

This project bridges the gap between:
- **Academic ecology** → **Practical gardening**
- **Scientific indicators** → **Actionable advice**
- **Research papers** → **Real-world impact**

With Prof. Shipley's validation, we're not just making another gardening app - we're bringing rigorous ecological science to every backyard, promoting biodiversity and sustainable gardening practices worldwide.

**"Every garden becomes a citizen science experiment, every gardener an ecological steward."**

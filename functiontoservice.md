## PART II: FUNCTIONAL STRATEGIES AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

### 2.6 Building on Pierce et al. (2016) CSR Framework

Pierce et al. (with Shipley as co-author) created a **globally-validated** CSR calculator. They proved 3 leaf traits capture 60% of variation across 14 traits (RV=0.597, P<0.0001).

**Key Pierce Discoveries We Build Upon**:
1. **Trees never show R-selection** - Validates our woody/non-woody split
2. **Tropical forests cluster at CS/CSR** (43:42:15%) - Provides validation targets
3. **Deserts split S vs R** - Shows bimodal strategies need different models
4. **Climate drives CSR** - CS linked to warmth/moisture, R to seasonality
5. **Growth forms differ fundamentally** - Trees, shrubs, forbs need separate treatment

| Aspect | Pierce et al. (2016) | Our Enhancement | Added Value |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Trait choice** | 3 traits (validated sufficient) | + wood + root traits | Captures organ coordination |
| **CSR tool** | "StrateFy" spreadsheet | Multi-organ StrateFy+ | Handles nonlinearity |
| **Biome patterns** | Described CSR signatures | Predict from traits | Enables new locations |
| **Climate links** | Fourth-corner analysis | + EIVE predictions | Quantitative matching |
| **Validation** | Co-inertia with 14 traits | + environmental outcomes | Real-world testing |

**Critical Insight**: Pierce's leaf-only CSR works well WITHIN organs but misses BETWEEN-organ coordination. Kong et al. (2019) showed root strategies can be **opposite** to leaf strategies in woody plants.

**Our Innovation**: 
1. Keep Pierce's validated CSR framework
2. Enhance with organ coordination (MAGs)
3. Add environmental prediction layer
4. Result: CSR + EIVE = Global planting guides


### 3.2 CSR Strategies Enhanced
The CSR framework classifies plants into three strategies. Multi-organ traits improve these classifications:
- **Competitors (C)**: Large leaves + wide vessels + thick roots = Fast resource capture
- **Stress-tolerators (S)**: Dense wood + deep roots + low SLA = Resource conservation  
- **Ruderals (R)**: High SLA + high SRL + thin roots = Rapid reproduction




### Real-World Validation: From Traits to Ecosystem Services

**Santos et al. (2021) Agroforestry Proof-of-Concept**:
A Brazilian experiment (co-authored by Shipley) proves trait-based design works:

**The Design Principle**:
```r
# Simple farmer-friendly categorization (Santos approach)
trait_categories = function(species_traits) {
  # Binary classification for practical adoption
  high_N_species = filter(traits, LNC > 25)  # Legumes, fast decomposers
  low_N_species = filter(traits, LNC < 25)   # Grasses, slow decomposers
  
  # Three mixture designs (constant richness = 8 species)
  designs = list(
    low_FD = sample(high_N_species, 8),      # Low diversity
    high_FD = c(sample(high_N_species, 4),   # High diversity
                sample(low_N_species, 4)),
    control = sample(low_N_species, 8)       # Low diversity
  )
}
```

**Proven Ecosystem Services** (via piecewise SEM):
- **Crop yield**: FD → LAI → Yield (R² = 0.85!)
- **Weed suppression**: FD → -0.57 weed cover
- **Soil protection**: FD → +0.93 crop cover
- **The mechanism**: Trait complementarity → Niche filling → Resource preemption

**Scaling to Global Planting Guides**:
```r
# From Brazilian agroforestry to worldwide application
global_planting_guide = function(location, goals) {
  # Step 1: Get local EIVE requirements (our prediction)
  local_EIVE = predict_from_climate(location)
  
  # Step 2: Filter species pool by EIVE match
  suitable_species = filter(global_flora, 
                           EIVE_M %in% local_EIVE$moisture_range,
                           EIVE_N %in% local_EIVE$nutrient_range)
  
  # Step 3: Design mixture for ecosystem services (Santos approach)
  if ("yield" %in% goals) {
    # Mix N-fixers with non-fixers (proven +LAI → +yield)
    mixture = design_complementary_mixture(suitable_species,
                                          traits = c("LNC", "Height", "SLA"))
  }
  
  if ("weed_control" %in% goals) {
    # Maximize functional diversity (proven -57% weeds)
    mixture = maximize_FD(suitable_species, 
                         n_species = 8)  # Santos optimal
  }
  
  if ("carbon_storage" %in% goals) {
    # Add woody species (Chave decomposition rates)
    mixture = add_woody_species(mixture, 
                               target_WD = 0.6)  # Tropical optimum
  }
  
  return(list(
    species_list = mixture,
    expected_services = predict_services(mixture),
    management_calendar = generate_timeline(mixture)
  ))
}
```

### 7.7 The Complete Vision: Validated and Ready

**What Santos et al. (2021) Proves**:
1. **Trait-based design WORKS**: High FD → Multiple ecosystem services
2. **Simple categories SUFFICIENT**: Binary traits (high/low N) are practical
3. **Piecewise SEM ACCURATE**: Shipley's methods capture real causality
4. **Complementarity > Richness**: HOW you mix matters more than HOW MANY

**Our Enhanced Framework Adds**:
1. **Global scope**: Predict EIVE for ANY species, not just European
2. **Multi-organ precision**: Beyond leaves to wood and roots
3. **Nonlinear realism**: Kong's curves + copulas + MAGs
4. **Carbon timeline**: Chave's decomposition rates for climate goals
5. **Practical tools**: StrateFy+ software for land managers

### 7.8 Tool Development: StrateFy+ 
Building on Pierce's "StrateFy" Excel tool, we propose "StrateFy+" with:
- **Multi-organ inputs**: Fields for wood density, root traits, mycorrhizal type
- **Nonlinear processing**: GAM-based transformations for root traits
- **Environmental output**: EIVE predictions alongside CSR coordinates
- **Ecosystem services**: Predicted yield, weed suppression, carbon storage
- **Climate matching**: Fourth-corner analysis to suggest suitable locations
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Confidence intervals based on organ data completeness
- **Recipe generator**: Simple mixtures for specific goals (Santos validated)



## Part III: FROM SCIENCE TO PRACTICE: ACTIONABLE PLANTING GUIDES

### 8.1 Practical Trait Categories for Land Managers

Building on Santos et al. (2021)'s success with simple binary traits, we propose farmer-friendly categories:

**Leaf Economics** (visual assessment):
- **"Fast" leaves**: Bright green, thin, large (SLA > 20 mm²/mg) → Quick nutrient cycling
- **"Slow" leaves**: Dark, thick, small (SLA < 15 mm²/mg) → Long-term mulch

**Wood Types** (chainsaw test):
- **"Soft" wood**: Easy to cut (WD < 0.4 g/cm³) → Fast growth, short lifespan
- **"Hard" wood**: Difficult to cut (WD > 0.7 g/cm³) → Slow growth, carbon storage

**Root Systems** (digging observation):
- **"Fibrous"**: Many fine roots (high SRL) → Nutrient scavenging
- **"Taproot"**: Few thick roots (low SRL) → Deep water access

**Mycorrhizal Partners**:
- **"Mushroom formers"** (EM): Oaks, pines → Organic matter decomposition
- **"Invisible helpers"** (AM): Most crops → Phosphorus acquisition

### 8.2 Recipe Cards for Ecosystem Services

**For HIGH YIELD** (Santos validated: +85% with high FD):
```
Mix 4 "Fast" species + 4 "Slow" species
Include 2+ nitrogen fixers (legumes)
Layer heights: Tall (>3m) + Medium (1-3m) + Ground (<1m)
Result: Maximum light capture → Maximum productivity
```

**For WEED CONTROL** (Santos validated: -57% weeds):
```
Use 8 species with contrasting traits
Fill all niches: Early/late season, shallow/deep roots
Include aggressive groundcovers (Arachis, sweet potato)
Result: No space for weeds!
```

**For CARBON STORAGE** (Chave validated):
```
Include 50% woody species with WD > 0.6 g/cm³
Mix decomposition rates: Fast N-fixers + slow hardwoods
Plant density: Follow natural forest (1000-2000 stems/ha)
Result: 50-100 year carbon residence time
```

# ★☆☆☆☆ - Poor

**Overall Score:** 55.4/100

Overall guild compatibility: 55.4/100

## Climate Compatibility

✅ All plants compatible with Tier 3 (Humid Temperate)

## Benefits

### High Phylogenetic Diversity [M1]

Plants are distantly related (Faith's PD: 885.18)  
Distant relatives typically share fewer pests and pathogens, reducing disease spread in the guild.  

*Evidence:* Phylogenetic diversity score: 70.4/100

### Natural Insect Pest Control [M3]

Guild provides insect pest control via 0 biocontrol mechanisms  
Plants attract beneficial insects (predators and parasitoids) that naturally suppress pest populations.  

*Evidence:* Biocontrol score: 100.0/100, covering 0 mechanisms

### Natural Disease Suppression [M4]

Guild provides disease suppression via 8 antagonistic fungal mechanisms  
Plants harbor beneficial fungi that antagonize pathogens, reducing disease incidence through biological control.  

*Evidence:* Pathogen control score: 100.0/100, covering 8 mechanisms

### Beneficial Mycorrhizal Network [M5]

279 shared mycorrhizal fungal species connect 4 plants  
Shared mycorrhizal fungi create underground networks that facilitate nutrient exchange, water sharing, and chemical communication between plants.  

*Evidence:* Network score: 97.1/100, coverage: 57.1%

## Warnings

⚠️ **8.4 CSR strategy conflicts detected**

Growth strategy incompatibility: 5 Competitive, 1 Stress-tolerant  
*Advice:* Consider mixing growth strategies more evenly, or group plants with similar strategies together

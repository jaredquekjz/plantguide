# ★★★★★ - Exceptional

**Overall Score:** 90.5/100

Overall guild compatibility: 90.5/100

## Climate Compatibility

✅ All plants compatible with Tier 3 (Humid Temperate)

## Benefits

### High Phylogenetic Diversity [M1]

Plants are distantly related (Faith's PD: 844.68)  
Distant relatives typically share fewer pests and pathogens, reducing disease spread in the guild.  

*Evidence:* Phylogenetic diversity score: 58.6/100

### Natural Insect Pest Control [M3]

Guild provides insect pest control via 5 biocontrol mechanisms  
Plants attract beneficial insects (predators and parasitoids) that naturally suppress pest populations.  

*Evidence:* Biocontrol score: 100.0/100, covering 5 mechanisms

### Natural Disease Suppression [M4]

Guild provides disease suppression via 6 antagonistic fungal mechanisms  
Plants harbor beneficial fungi that antagonize pathogens, reducing disease incidence through biological control.  

*Evidence:* Pathogen control score: 100.0/100, covering 6 mechanisms

### Beneficial Mycorrhizal Network [M5]

147 shared mycorrhizal fungal species connect 5 plants  
Shared mycorrhizal fungi create underground networks that facilitate nutrient exchange, water sharing, and chemical communication between plants.  

*Evidence:* Network score: 97.7/100, coverage: 71.4%

### High Structural Diversity [M6]

4 growth forms spanning 22.8m height range  
Diverse plant structures create vertical stratification, maximizing space use, light capture, and habitat complexity.  

*Evidence:* Structural diversity score: 85.0/100, stratification quality: 1.00

### Robust Pollinator Support [M7]

170 shared pollinator species  
Plants attract and support overlapping pollinator communities, ensuring reliable pollination services and promoting pollinator diversity.  

*Evidence:* Pollinator support score: 92.0/100

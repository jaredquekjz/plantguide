## Benefits

### Natural Disease Suppression [M4 - 63.3/100]

Guild provides disease suppression via 4 antagonistic fungal mechanisms  
Plants harbor beneficial fungi that antagonize pathogens, reducing disease incidence through biological control.  

*Evidence:* Pathogen control score: 63.3/100, covering 4 mechanisms

#### Pathogen Control Network Profile

*Qualitative information about disease suppression (influences M4 scoring)*

**Summary:**
- 1 unique mycoparasite species (fungi that parasitize other fungi)
- 22 unique pathogen species in guild

**Mechanism Summary:**
- 0 Specific antagonist matches (pathogen → known mycoparasite or fungivore, weight 1.0)
- 1 General mycoparasite fungi (primary mechanism, weight 0.5)

**No specific pathogen-antagonist matches found.**
The disease suppression score is driven by the presence of **general mycoparasitic fungi** (e.g., Trichoderma) which provide broad-spectrum protection against fungal pathogens.

**Network Hubs (plants harboring most mycoparasites):**

| Plant | Mycoparasites | Pathogens |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Alyxia ruscifolia (Chainfruit) | 1 | 2 |
| Carex mucronata | 0 | 4 |
| Eucalyptus melanophloia (Silver-leaved Ironbark) | 0 | 1 |
| Hibbertia diffusa (Wedge Guinea Flower) ⚠️ | 0 | 0 |
| Juncus usitatus (Common Rush) ⚠️ | 0 | 0 |
| Senna artemisioides (Silver Cassia) | 0 | 1 |
| Sporobolus compositus (Composite Dropseed) | 0 | 15 |

⚠️ **Data Completeness Note:** Plants marked with ⚠️ have no interaction data in this dimension. This likely indicates a data gap rather than true ecological absence.

### Beneficial Mycorrhizal Network [M5 - 45.0/100]

16 shared beneficial fungal species connect 4 plants  
Shared beneficial fungi (mycorrhizal partners, endophytes, and saprotrophs) create underground networks that facilitate nutrient exchange, water sharing, and chemical communication between plants.  

*Evidence:* Network score: 45.0/100, coverage: 57.1%

#### Beneficial Fungi Network Profile

*Qualitative information about fungal networks (60% of M5 scoring)*

**Total unique beneficial fungi species:** 16

**Fungal Community Composition:**

- 0 AMF species (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal) - 0.0%
- 0 EMF species (Ectomycorrhizal) - 0.0%
- 2 Endophytic species - 12.5%
- 14 Saprotrophic species - 87.5%

⚠ **Dual-Lifestyle Fungi**: Some fungi have both beneficial (decomposition, nutrient cycling) and pathogenic (disease-causing) roles. While they contribute to the beneficial fungi network (included in M5 score), they may cause leaf spots, fruit rot, or other diseases under favorable conditions.

Plant pH preferences:
Alyxia ruscifolia (Chainfruit): Neutral (pH 6-7)
Carex mucronata (Carex): Strongly Alkaline (pH >8)
Eucalyptus melanophloia (Silver-leaved ironbark): Neutral (pH 6-7)

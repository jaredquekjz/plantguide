### Soil

*Soil conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation across locations. These show where plants are found after competition - many species on poor soils are competitively excluded from richer soils, not physiologically limited. Experiment with fertility. Data from SoilGrids 2.0.*

**Topsoil (0-15cm)** - *the layer you can amend*

**pH**: 6.4 typical (range 5.3-7.6)
*Slightly acidic; wide tolerance - adaptable to most garden soils*
**Fertility (CEC)**: 24 cmol/kg (18-33 across locations)
*Good retention - soil holds fertilizer well; benefits from annual feeding*

## Maintenance Profile
**Growth Strategy**: S-dominant (C 27% / S 51% / R 22%)

*CSR is a key framework in plant ecology that classifies plants by survival strategy: **Competitors** (C) grow fast to dominate space and light, **Stress-tolerators** (S) endure difficult conditions patiently, and **Ruderals** (R) live short lives but reproduce prolifically.*

This plant scores highest in **S (Stress-tolerator)** — it's built for endurance, not speed. Grows slowly, tolerates neglect, and generally thrives when left alone.

**Effort Level**: LOW-MEDIUM

**What to Expect**:
Slow, steady grower with low nutrient demand. Slow to establish; train carefully in first years. Minimal intervention once settled.

**Practical Considerations**:
**Pruning**: Easy access at 2.0m; hand tools sufficient
**Spreading**: Small seeds; occasional new plants may appear nearby
**Leaf litter**: Deciduous with small leaves; light autumn debris

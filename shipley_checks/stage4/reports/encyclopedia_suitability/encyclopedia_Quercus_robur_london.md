## Maintenance Profile
**Growth Strategy**: C-dominant (C 45% / S 41% / R 14%)

*CSR is a key framework in plant ecology that classifies plants by survival strategy: **Competitors** (C) grow fast to dominate space and light, **Stress-tolerators** (S) endure difficult conditions patiently, and **Ruderals** (R) live short lives but reproduce prolifically.*

This plant scores highest in **C (Competitor)** — it's a vigorous grower that will actively spread and may outcompete neighbours. Needs more attention to keep in check.

**Effort Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**What to Expect**:
Fast, vigorous grower with high nutrient demand. Benefits from annual feeding. May cast dense shade; thin annually to allow light below. High nutrient uptake may affect neighbours.

**Practical Considerations**:
**Pruning**: Professional arborist needed at 27m mature height
**Leaf litter**: Deciduous with medium leaves; moderate autumn raking

**Watch For**:
- May outcompete slower-growing neighbours
- Dense shade may suppress understory plants

## Ecosystem Services

*How this plant contributes to garden health and environmental benefits. Ratings derived from functional traits and growth strategy (CSR scores).*

### Productivity
**Net Primary Productivity**: Very High (5.0)
*Rapid growth produces abundant biomass each year—more leaves, stems, and roots. Provides food for wildlife, improves air quality, and captures significant carbon from the atmosphere.*
**Decomposition Rate**: High (4.0)
*Fast litter breakdown returns nutrients to soil quickly, keeping it fertile and reducing fertilizer needs. Supports active earthworms and soil microbes.*

### Nutrient Dynamics
*How efficiently nutrients move through your garden—from soil to plants to decomposers and back. Good cycling creates a self-sustaining system.*

- **Nutrient Cycling**: High (4.0)
- **Nutrient Retention**: High (4.0) - holds nutrients well; reduces fertilizer needs
- **Nutrient Loss Risk**: Moderate (3.0) - moderate loss potential

### Carbon Storage
*Plants capture CO₂ from the atmosphere. Some store it in living tissue (biomass), others contribute long-lasting carbon to soil.*

- **Living Biomass**: High (4.0) - large, dense growth captures significant CO₂; creates habitat and shade
- **Long-term Soil Carbon**: Moderate (3.0) - some long-lasting carbon contribution
- **Total Carbon Benefit**: High (4.0)

### Soil Services
**Erosion Protection**: High (4.0)
*Extensive roots and ground cover anchor soil, protecting topsoil during storms and preventing sediment runoff to waterways. Excellent for slopes.*
**Nitrogen Fixation**: Unable to Classify
*Does not fix atmospheric nitrogen. Benefits from nitrogen-fixing companion plants.*

**Garden Value**: Good choice - good carbon storage for climate-conscious planting; fast-growing for quick establishment; excellent for slopes and erosion-prone areas.

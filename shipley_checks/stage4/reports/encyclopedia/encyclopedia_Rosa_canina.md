    ## Growing Requirements

    ☀️ **Light**: Half-light plant (mostly well lit but tolerates shade) (EIVE-L: 7.2/10)
     → Requires full sun in open positions

    💧 **Water**: Moderately dry; also in dry sites with humidity (EIVE-M: 3.9/10)
     → Water sparingly; allow soil to dry between waterings | Drought-tolerant once established (stress-tolerator strategy)

  🌡️ **Climate**: Climate preferences unknown

    🌱 **Fertility**: Moderately poor; low fertility (EIVE-N: 4.3/10)
     → Moderate fertility; balanced fertilizer in spring

    ⚗️ **pH**: Weakly acidic to weakly basic; absent from very acid (EIVE-R: 6.4/10)
     → Adaptable to slightly acidic to neutral soil | pH 6.0-7.0

    ## Maintenance Profile

  **Maintenance Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

    🌿 **Growth Rate**: Moderate (CSR strategy)
     → Steady growth rate
     → Light pruning to guide growth

    🍂 **Seasonal Tasks**:
     → Spring: Remove dead growth, apply mulch
     → Summer: Minimal intervention, occasional deadheading
     → Autumn: Rake fallen leaves for compost
     → Winter: Protect from frost if tender

    ♻️ **Waste Management**:
     → Moderate decomposition rate
     → Suitable for composting
     → Can be used as mulch
     → Seasonal leaf drop creates moderate waste volume

    ⏰ **Time Commitment**: ~1.3 hours per year

    ## Ecosystem Services

  **Environmental Benefits**:

    🌿 **Carbon Sequestration**: ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate (confidence: High)
     Stores ~14 kg CO₂/year in biomass
     → Contributes to garden carbon sequestration

      🌊 **Erosion Control**: ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate (confidence: Moderate)
     Ground cover reduces water runoff
     → Useful for moderate erosion control

      ♻️ **Nutrient Cycling**: ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate (confidence: High)
     Moderate decomposition contributes to nutrient availability
     → Modest contribution to nutrient cycling

    ## Biological Interactions

  **Natural Relationships**:

    🐝 **Pollinators**: Excellent pollinator value (113 species documented)
     → Plant in groups to maximize pollinator benefit
       → Peak pollinator activity during flowering season

    🐛 **Pest Pressure**: LOW with excellent natural control
     19 known herbivore species
     15 predator species + 0 entomopathogenic fungi
     → Avoid chemical sprays to preserve beneficial predators
       → Natural enemies provide good pest suppression

    🦠 **Disease Risk**: MODERATE-HIGH
     165 documented pathogen species
     1 antagonistic fungi available
     → Preventive measures recommended
       → Ensure good drainage, avoid overhead watering
       → Consider biocontrol inoculants (e.g., Trichoderma)

    🍄 **Beneficial Fungi**: Active soil partnerships
     Mycorrhizal associations possible - may enhance nutrient uptake
       Endophytic fungi (7 species) - boost disease resistance
     → Consider general mycorrhizal inoculant
     → Avoid fungicides; preserve soil biology

Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*Values show typical conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation from mildest to most extreme locations.*

**Temperature**: 24°C warmest month, -1°C coldest month
*Range: -10°C to 31°C across all population locations*
**Rainfall**: 764mm/year (439-1177mm across locations)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Cfb (Temperate oceanic - mild year-round, no dry season (typical Western Europe))
**Frost**: 2 days/year (up to 4 in coldest locations)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Warm nights**: Rare (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Day-night swing**: 8°C typical daily range
*Temperate - moderate variation*
**Growing season**: 269 days (~9 months)
*Long - ranges from 196 to 364 days across locations*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.3/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Dry spells**: 12 consecutive dry days typical, 26 in driest locations
  *Limited - Keep soil moist; don't let dry out*
- **Disease pressure**: 3 warm-wet days/year
  *Low (dry climate origin) - may be vulnerable to fungal diseases in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 3.9/10
- Typical position: Dry conditions
- Watering: Sparse; weekly in drought
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

*Soil conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation across locations. Data from SoilGrids 2.0.*

**Topsoil (0-15cm)** - *the layer you can amend*

**pH**: 6.4 typical (range 5.3-7.6)
*Slightly acidic; wide tolerance - adaptable to most garden soils*
**Fertility (CEC)**: 24 cmol/kg (18-33 across locations)
*Good retention - soil holds fertilizer well; benefits from annual feeding*
**Organic Carbon**: 42 g/kg (20-96 across locations)

**Texture**

| Component | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sand | 32% | 17-59% |
| Silt | 42% | 5-69% |
| Clay | 25% | 14-37% |

**USDA Class**: Loam
*Drainage: Good | Water retention: Good - Ideal soil; balanced drainage and retention; suits most plants*

**Triangle Coordinates**: x=55.0, y=25.2
*For plotting on USDA texture triangle; x = 0.5×clay + silt, y = clay*

---

**Profile Average (0-200cm)** - *underlying conditions*

| Indicator | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| pH | 6.6 | 5.5-7.7 |
| CEC (cmol/kg) | 18 | 12-29 |
| SOC (g/kg) | 12 | 5-45 |

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 6.4/10
- Typical position: Neutral
- Compost: Tolerates some lime
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 4.3/10
- Typical position: Moderate nutrient
- Feeding: Standard annual feeding in spring
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

## Maintenance Profile
**Growth Strategy**: S-dominant (C 27% / S 51% / R 22%)

*CSR is a key framework in plant ecology that classifies plants by survival strategy: **Competitors** (C) grow fast to dominate space and light, **Stress-tolerators** (S) endure difficult conditions patiently, and **Ruderals** (R) live short lives but reproduce prolifically.*

This plant scores highest in **S (Stress-tolerator)** — it's built for endurance, not speed. Grows slowly, tolerates neglect, and generally thrives when left alone.

**Effort Level**: LOW-MEDIUM

**What to Expect**:
Slow, steady grower with low nutrient demand. Slow to establish; train carefully in first years. Minimal intervention once settled.

**Practical Considerations**:
**Pruning**: Easy access at 2.0m; hand tools sufficient
**Spreading**: Small seeds; occasional new plants may appear nearby
**Leaf litter**: Deciduous with small leaves; light autumn debris

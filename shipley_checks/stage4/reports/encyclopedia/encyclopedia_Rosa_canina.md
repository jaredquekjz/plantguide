## Growing Requirements

### Light

**EIVE-L**: 7.2/10 - Full sun to part shade
Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*This section shows where populations naturally occur (climate tolerance) and where species is most abundant (ecological indicators):*

**Temperature extremes**: Coldest winter night -3°C, hottest summer day 25°C
**Temperature means**: Average 24°C in warmest month, -1°C in coldest month
**Annual rainfall**: 439-1177mm/year across populations (typically 764mm)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Cfb (Temperate oceanic - mild year-round, no dry season (typical Western Europe))
**Cold tolerance**: Coldest populations survive -3°C winter nights (Half-hardy)
**Heat tolerance**: Hottest populations experience 25°C summer days (Cool-climate)
**Frost exposure**: 0-4 frost days/year (typically 2)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Cold spell tolerance**: Populations survive up to 22 consecutive frost days
*Extended freezing - Can endure extended cold periods*
**Warm nights**: Essentially none (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Climate type**: Populations found where day-night temperature varies by 6-12°C (typically 8°C)
*Moderate variation climate - Typical temperate variation
**Growing season**: 196-364 days/year with temperatures suitable for growth (typically 269 - about 9 months)
*Long - Period when temperatures allow active growth*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.3/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Annual rainfall**: 439-1177mm (typically 764mm)
  *Temperate climate*
- **Dry spells**: Typically 12 consecutive dry days, up to 26 days maximum
  *Limited - Needs moisture during 2+ week dry spells*
- Warm-wet conditions: Populations found where 1-5 days/year are warm & wet (typically 3)
  *Low disease pressure - Plant from drier climates; may be vulnerable in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 3.9/10
- Typical position: Dry conditions
- Watering: Sparse; weekly in drought
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

**pH tolerance**: 5.2-7.5 (from most acidic to most alkaline population locations)
*Wide tolerance; adaptable*

---

**pH**: 5.2-7.5 (typically 6.3)
*Slightly acidic*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 6.4/10
- Typical position: Neutral
- Compost: Tolerates some lime
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Fertility**: Populations found in fertile soils (CEC 28 cmol/kg)
*Good nutrient retention (clay loam) - Benefits from annual feeding*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 4.3/10
- Typical position: Moderate nutrient
- Feeding: Standard annual feeding
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

**Texture**: Populations found primarily in loam (clay ~25%)
*Moderate sand tolerance - Standard garden soil works*

### Top Companion Principles

Based on this plant's characteristics:

1. **Taxonomic diversity** - seek plants from different families than Rosaceae
2. **CSR compatibility** - flexible positioning; compatible with most
3. **Structural layering** - can grow under taller plants
4. **Mycorrhizal network** - no network constraints

### Cautions

- Avoid clustering multiple Rosaceae plants (shared pests)

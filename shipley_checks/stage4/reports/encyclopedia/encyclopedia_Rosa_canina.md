## Growing Requirements



☀️ **Light**: Half-light plant (mostly well lit but tolerates shade) (EIVE-L: 7.2/10)
   → Requires full sun in open positions

💧 **Water**: Moderately dry; also in dry sites with humidity (EIVE-M: 3.9/10)
   → Water sparingly; allow soil to dry between waterings | Drought-tolerant once established (stress-tolerator strategy)

🌡️ **Climate**: Climate preferences unknown

🌱 **Fertility**: Moderately poor; low fertility (EIVE-N: 4.3/10)
   → Moderate fertility; balanced fertilizer in spring

⚗️ **pH**: Weakly acidic to weakly basic; absent from very acid (EIVE-R: 6.4/10)
   → Adaptable to slightly acidic to neutral soil | pH 6.0-7.0

## Maintenance Profile


**Maintenance Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

🌿 **Growth Rate**: Moderate (CSR strategy)
   → Steady growth rate
   → Light pruning to guide growth

🍂 **Seasonal Tasks**:
   → Spring: Remove dead growth, apply mulch
   → Summer: Minimal intervention, occasional deadheading
   → Autumn: Rake fallen leaves for compost
   → Winter: Protect from frost if tender

♻️ **Waste Management**:
   → Moderate decomposition rate
   → Suitable for composting
   → Can be used as mulch
   → Seasonal leaf drop creates moderate waste volume

⏰ **Time Commitment**: ~1.3 hours per year

## Ecosystem Services
**Environmental benefits**: Data insufficient for confident assessment

---

## Biological Interactions
**Natural Relationships**:
🐝 **Pollinators**: Excellent pollinator value (40 species documented)
   → Plant in groups to maximize pollinator benefit
   → Peak pollinator activity during flowering season
🐛 **Pest Pressure**: MODERATE-HIGH
   19 known herbivore species
   0 predator species + 0 entomopathogenic fungi
   → Consider companion planting for additional pest control
   → Use targeted organic controls if needed
🦠 **Disease Risk**: MODERATE-HIGH
   165 documented pathogen species
   0 antagonistic fungi available
   → Preventive measures recommended
   → Ensure good drainage, avoid overhead watering
   → Consider biocontrol inoculants (e.g., Trichoderma)
🍄 **Beneficial Fungi**: Associations not well documented
   → May benefit from general mycorrhizal inoculant

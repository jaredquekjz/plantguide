## Growing Requirements

### Light

**EIVE-L**: 7.6/10 - Full sun to part shade
Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*This section shows where populations naturally occur (climate tolerance) and where species is most abundant (ecological indicators):*

**Temperature extremes**: Coldest winter night -8°C, hottest summer day 30°C
**Temperature means**: Average 27°C in warmest month, -4°C in coldest month
**Annual rainfall**: 443-1539mm/year across populations (typically 934mm)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Cfa (Humid subtropical - hot humid summers, mild winters, rain year-round)
**Cold tolerance**: Coldest populations survive -8°C winter nights (Moderately hardy)
**Heat tolerance**: Hottest populations experience 30°C summer days (Cool-climate)
**Frost exposure**: 0-5 frost days/year (typically 3)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Cold spell tolerance**: Populations survive up to 37 consecutive frost days
*Long winter freeze - Can endure extended cold periods*
**Warm nights**: Essentially none (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Climate type**: Populations found where day-night temperature varies by 7-14°C (typically 10°C)
*Moderate variation climate - Typical temperate variation
**Growing season**: 164-365 days/year with temperatures suitable for growth (typically 260 - about 9 months)
*Long - Period when temperatures allow active growth*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.1/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Annual rainfall**: 443-1539mm (typically 934mm)
  *Temperate climate*
- **Dry spells**: Typically 13 consecutive dry days, up to 28 days maximum
  *Limited - Needs moisture during 2+ week dry spells*
- Warm-wet conditions: Populations found where 1-4 days/year are warm & wet (typically 3)
  *Low disease pressure - Plant from drier climates; may be vulnerable in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 4.5/10
- Typical position: Moderate moisture
- Watering: Regular; 1-2 times weekly
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

**pH tolerance**: 4.8-6.9 (from most acidic to most alkaline population locations)
*Wide tolerance; adaptable*

---

**pH**: 4.8-6.9 (typically 5.7)
*Slightly acidic*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 5.8/10
- Typical position: Slightly acidic to neutral
- Compost: Standard multipurpose compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Fertility**: Populations found in fertile soils (CEC 28 cmol/kg)
*Good nutrient retention (clay loam) - Benefits from annual feeding*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 6.4/10
- Typical position: High nutrient
- Feeding: Benefits from generous feeding
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

**Texture**: Populations found primarily in loam (clay ~22%)
*Moderate sand tolerance - Standard garden soil works*

Annuals or short-lived perennials; replant each year or allow self-sowing. Deadhead to extend flowering or allow seeding depending on preference. Collect seed before removal for next season.

**Seasonal Tasks**:
- **Spring**: Sow/plant replacements
- **Summer**: Deadhead, collect seed
- **Autumn**: Clear spent growth, save seed
- **Winter**: Plan succession planting

**Watch For**:
- Short-lived; plan for replacement
- May self-seed prolifically

## Guild Potential

### Summary Card

| Metric | Value | Guild Contribution |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Taxonomic | Leguminosae → Trifolium | Seek different families |
| CSR Strategy | C:15% S:15% R:71% | Plan succession |

### GP1: Phylogenetic Independence

**Family**: Leguminosae
**Genus**: Trifolium

**Guild Recommendation**:
- Avoid clustering plants from the same genus (highest shared pest risk)
- Diversify beyond Leguminosae for reduced pathogen transmission
- Greater taxonomic distance = lower shared vulnerability

### GP2: Growth Compatibility

**Classification**: R-dominant (Ruderal) (percentile-based)
**Growth Form**: Herb/Ground cover
**Height**: 0.2m
**Light Preference**: EIVE-L 7.6

**Companion Strategy**:
- Annual/biennial. Good for dynamic, changing plantings.
- Pair with longer-lived S or balanced plants for continuity.
- Will not persist; plan for succession or self-seeding.

**Good Companions**: S-dominant or balanced plants for continuity. Other R-plants for dynamic seasonal display.

### GP3: Pest Control Potential

**Guild Recommendations**:
- **Network-compatible plants**: Other plants with AMF associations
- **Network bonus**: Can share phosphorus and carbon with AMF-compatible neighbours
- **Soil tip**: Minimize tillage to preserve fungal hyphal connections

### GP6: Structural Role

**Layer**: Ground cover (0.2m)
**Growth Form**: Herb/Ground cover
**Light Preference**: EIVE-L 7.6

**Guild Recommendations**:
- **Role**: Soil protection, weed suppression
- **Pair with**: Any taller plants (provides living mulch)

### GP7: Pollinator Support

**Observed Pollinators**: 160 species (Exceptional)
Major pollinator resource (top 10%)

**Guild Recommendations**:
- Pollinator hotspot (top 10%). Central to garden pollination success.
- Benefits ALL flowering neighbours through strong attraction effect.

**This Plant Provides**:
- Nectar/pollen source for 160 pollinator species
- Attraction effect may increase visits to neighbouring plants

### Top Companion Principles

Based on this plant's characteristics:

1. **Taxonomic diversity** - seek plants from different families than Leguminosae
2. **CSR compatibility** - pair with longer-lived S or balanced plants
3. **Structural layering** - can grow under taller plants
4. **Mycorrhizal network** - seek other AMF-associated plants

### Cautions

- Avoid clustering multiple Leguminosae plants (shared pests)
- Sun-loving: will fail under canopy shade

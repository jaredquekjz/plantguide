## Growing Requirements

### Light

**EIVE-L**: 7.6/10 - Full sun to part shade
Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*Values show typical conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation from mildest to most extreme locations.*

**Temperature**: 27°C warmest month, -4°C coldest month
*Range: -17°C to 34°C across all population locations*
**Rainfall**: 934mm/year (443-1539mm across locations)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Cfa (Humid subtropical - hot humid summers, mild winters, rain year-round)
**Frost**: 3 days/year (up to 5 in coldest locations)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Warm nights**: Rare (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Day-night swing**: 10°C typical daily range
*Temperate - moderate variation*
**Growing season**: 260 days (~9 months)
*Long - ranges from 164 to 365 days across locations*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.1/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Dry spells**: 13 consecutive dry days typical, 28 in driest locations
  *Limited - Keep soil moist; don't let dry out*
- **Disease pressure**: 3 warm-wet days/year
  *Low (dry climate origin) - may be vulnerable to fungal diseases in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 4.5/10
- Typical position: Moderate moisture
- Watering: Regular; 1-2 times weekly
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

*Soil conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation across locations. Data from SoilGrids 2.0.*

**Topsoil (0-15cm)** - *the layer you can amend*

**pH**: 5.8 typical (range 4.9-7.0)
*Slightly acidic; wide tolerance - adaptable to most garden soils*
**Fertility (CEC)**: 22 cmol/kg (11-38 across locations)
*Good retention - soil holds fertilizer well; benefits from annual feeding*
**Organic Carbon**: 46 g/kg (19-128 across locations)

**Texture**

| Component | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sand | 38% | 14-63% |
| Silt | 40% | 2-76% |
| Clay | 23% | 9-35% |

**USDA Class**: Loam
*Drainage: Good | Water retention: Good - Ideal soil; balanced drainage and retention; suits most plants*

**Triangle Coordinates**: x=51.1, y=22.7
*For plotting on USDA texture triangle; x = 0.5×clay + silt, y = clay*

---

**Profile Average (0-200cm)** - *underlying conditions*

| Indicator | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| pH | 6.0 | 5.1-7.4 |
| CEC (cmol/kg) | 17 | 7-28 |
| SOC (g/kg) | 12 | 4-58 |

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 5.8/10
- Typical position: Slightly acidic to neutral
- Compost: Standard multipurpose compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 6.4/10
- Typical position: High nutrient
- Feeding: Benefits from generous feeding; responds well to compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

### Productivity
**Net Primary Productivity**: Moderate (3.0)
*Moderate growth rate. Steady biomass production for a balanced contribution to garden ecosystem.*
**Decomposition Rate**: Very High (5.0)
*Fast litter breakdown returns nutrients to soil quickly, keeping it fertile and reducing fertilizer needs. Supports active earthworms and soil microbes.*

### Nutrient Dynamics
*How efficiently nutrients move through your garden—from soil to plants to decomposers and back. Good cycling creates a self-sustaining system.*

- **Nutrient Cycling**: Very High (5.0)
- **Nutrient Retention**: Low (2.0) - nutrients may leach away; more frequent feeding needed

- **Living Biomass**: Low (2.0) - smaller plants store less carbon in living tissue
- **Long-term Soil Carbon**: Low (2.0) - soft tissues decompose quickly; less permanent storage
- **Total Carbon Benefit**: Low (2.0)

### Soil Services
**Erosion Protection**: Low (2.0)
*Limited root coverage; consider underplanting with ground covers on slopes.*
**Nitrogen Fixation**: Unable to Classify
*Does not fix atmospheric nitrogen. Benefits from nitrogen-fixing companion plants.*

### Top Companion Principles

Based on this plant's characteristics:

1. **Taxonomic diversity** - seek plants from different families than Leguminosae
2. **CSR compatibility** - pair with longer-lived S or balanced plants
3. **Structural layering** - can grow under taller plants
4. **Mycorrhizal network** - seek other AMF-associated plants

### Cautions

- Avoid clustering multiple Leguminosae plants (shared pests)
- Sun-loving: will fail under canopy shade

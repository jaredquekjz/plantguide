## Relatives Within Genus

**5 Closest Relatives** (from 48 *Trifolium* species in database, by evolutionary distance):

| Species | Common Name | Relatedness |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| *Trifolium nigrescens* | Small White Clover | Very close |
| *Trifolium suffocatum* | Suffocated Clover | Very close |
| *Trifolium uniflorum* | One-flowered Clover | Very close |
| *Trifolium retusum* | Teasel Clover | Very close |
| *Trifolium thalii* | Thal's Clover | Very close |

*These clovers are most similar to your plant. They likely need similar soil, water, and care—handy if you want alternatives or companions that "go together." But they also catch the same bugs and diseases, so don't plant too many of the same type in one spot. Mix in plants from different families for a healthier garden.*

### Climate

*Values show typical conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation from mildest to most extreme locations.*

**Temperature**: 27°C warmest month, -4°C coldest month
*Range: -17°C to 34°C across all population locations*
**Rainfall**: 934mm/year (443-1539mm across locations)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Cfa (Humid subtropical - hot humid summers, mild winters, rain year-round)
**Frost**: 3 days/year (up to 5 in coldest locations)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Warm nights**: Rare (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Day-night swing**: 10°C typical daily range
*Temperate - moderate variation*
**Growing season**: 260 days (~9 months)
*Long - ranges from 164 to 365 days across locations*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.1/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Dry spells**: 13 consecutive dry days typical, 28 in driest locations
  *Limited - Keep soil moist; don't let dry out*
- **Disease pressure**: 3 warm-wet days/year
  *Low (dry climate origin) - may be vulnerable to fungal diseases in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 4.5/10
- Typical position: Moderate moisture
- Watering: Regular; 1-2 times weekly
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

*Soil conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation across locations. Data from SoilGrids 2.0.*

**Topsoil (0-15cm)** - *the layer you can amend*

**pH**: 5.8 typical (range 4.9-7.0)
*Slightly acidic; wide tolerance - adaptable to most garden soils*
**Fertility (CEC)**: 22 cmol/kg (11-38 across locations)
*Good retention - soil holds fertilizer well; benefits from annual feeding*
**Organic Carbon**: 46 g/kg (19-128 across locations)

**Texture**

| Component | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sand | 38% | 14-63% |
| Silt | 40% | 2-76% |
| Clay | 23% | 9-35% |

**USDA Class**: Loam
*Drainage: Good | Water retention: Good - Ideal soil; balanced drainage and retention; suits most plants*

**Triangle Coordinates**: x=51.1, y=22.7
*For plotting on USDA texture triangle; x = 0.5×clay + silt, y = clay*

---

**Profile Average (0-200cm)** - *underlying conditions*

| Indicator | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| pH | 6.0 | 5.1-7.4 |
| CEC (cmol/kg) | 17 | 7-28 |
| SOC (g/kg) | 12 | 4-58 |

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 5.8/10
- Typical position: Slightly acidic to neutral
- Compost: Standard multipurpose compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 6.4/10
- Typical position: High nutrient
- Feeding: Benefits from generous feeding; responds well to compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

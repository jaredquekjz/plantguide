## Growing Requirements



☀️ **Light**: Between semi-shade and semi-sun (EIVE-L: 6.2/10)
   → Prefers open sites with good light but tolerates some shade

💧 **Water**: Moist; upper range of fresh soils (EIVE-M: 4.8/10)
   → Water regularly during growing season; moderate moisture

🌡️ **Climate**: Climate preferences unknown

🌱 **Fertility**: Moderately poor; low fertility (EIVE-N: 4.5/10)
   → Moderate fertility; balanced fertilizer in spring

⚗️ **pH**: Moderately acidic soils; occasional neutral/basic (EIVE-R: 5.2/10)
   → Adaptable to slightly acidic to neutral soil | pH 6.0-7.0

## Maintenance Profile


**Maintenance Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

🌿 **Growth Rate**: Moderate (CS strategy)
   → Steady growth rate
   → Prune as needed to maintain shape

🍂 **Seasonal Tasks**:
   → Spring: Shape after frost risk passes
   → Summer: Minimal intervention, occasional deadheading
   → Autumn: Rake fallen leaves for compost
   → Winter: Structural pruning while dormant (if deciduous)

♻️ **Waste Management**:
   → Moderate decomposition rate
   → Suitable for composting
   → Can be used as mulch
   → Seasonal leaf drop creates moderate waste volume

⏰ **Time Commitment**: ~4 hours per year

## Ecosystem Services
**Environmental benefits**: Data insufficient for confident assessment

---

## Biological Interactions
**Natural Relationships**:
🐝 **Pollinators**: Good pollinator value (14 species documented)
   → Attracts diverse pollinators
   → Consider companion planting with other pollinator plants
🐛 **Pest Pressure**: MODERATE-HIGH
   19 known herbivore species
   0 predator species + 0 entomopathogenic fungi
   → Consider companion planting for additional pest control
   → Use targeted organic controls if needed
🦠 **Disease Risk**: MODERATE-HIGH
   21 documented pathogen species
   0 antagonistic fungi available
   → Preventive measures recommended
   → Ensure good drainage, avoid overhead watering
   → Consider biocontrol inoculants (e.g., Trichoderma)
🍄 **Beneficial Fungi**: Associations not well documented
   → May benefit from general mycorrhizal inoculant

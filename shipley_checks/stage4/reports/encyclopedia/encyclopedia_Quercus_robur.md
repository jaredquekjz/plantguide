    ## Growing Requirements

    ☀️ **Light**: Between semi-shade and semi-sun (EIVE-L: 6.2/10)
     → Prefers open sites with good light but tolerates some shade

    💧 **Water**: Moist; upper range of fresh soils (EIVE-M: 4.8/10)
     → Water regularly during growing season; moderate moisture | Drought-tolerant once established (stress-tolerator strategy)

  🌡️ **Climate**: Climate preferences unknown

    🌱 **Fertility**: Moderately poor; low fertility (EIVE-N: 4.5/10)
     → Moderate fertility; balanced fertilizer in spring

    ⚗️ **pH**: Moderately acidic soils; occasional neutral/basic (EIVE-R: 5.2/10)
     → Adaptable to slightly acidic to neutral soil | pH 6.0-7.0

    ## Maintenance Profile

  **Maintenance Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

    🌿 **Growth Rate**: Moderate (CS strategy)
     → Steady growth rate
     → Prune as needed to maintain shape

    🍂 **Seasonal Tasks**:
     → Spring: Shape after frost risk passes
     → Summer: Minimal intervention, occasional deadheading
     → Autumn: Rake fallen leaves for compost
     → Winter: Structural pruning while dormant (if deciduous)

    ♻️ **Waste Management**:
     → Moderate decomposition rate
     → Suitable for composting
     → Can be used as mulch
     → Seasonal leaf drop creates moderate waste volume

    ⏰ **Time Commitment**: ~4 hours per year

    ## Ecosystem Services

  **Environmental Benefits**:

    🌿 **Carbon Sequestration**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (confidence: High)
     Stores ~190 kg CO₂/year in biomass
     → Excellent choice for carbon-conscious gardening

      🌊 **Erosion Control**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (confidence: Moderate)
     Deep woody roots anchor soil on slopes
     → Excellent for slopes, banks, and erosion-prone sites

      ♻️ **Nutrient Cycling**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (confidence: High)
     Fast-decomposing litter rapidly returns nutrients to soil
     → Excellent for building soil health over time

    ## Biological Interactions

  **Natural Relationships**:

    🐝 **Pollinators**: Excellent pollinator value (39 species documented)
     → Plant in groups to maximize pollinator benefit
       → Peak pollinator activity during flowering season

    🐛 **Pest Pressure**: MODERATE with good natural control
     19 known herbivore species
     4 predator species + 0 entomopathogenic fungi
     → Monitor pests but rely on natural enemies first
       → Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides

    🦠 **Disease Risk**: MODERATE-HIGH
     21 documented pathogen species
     0 antagonistic fungi available
     → Preventive measures recommended
       → Ensure good drainage, avoid overhead watering
       → Consider biocontrol inoculants (e.g., Trichoderma)

    🍄 **Beneficial Fungi**: Active soil partnerships
     Ectomycorrhizae (EMF) - enhances nutrient uptake and drought resistance
     → Use EMF inoculant for woody plants
     → Avoid fungicides; preserve soil biology

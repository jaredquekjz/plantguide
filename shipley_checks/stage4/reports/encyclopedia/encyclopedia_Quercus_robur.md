## Growing Requirements

### Light

**EIVE-L**: 6.2/10 - Full sun to part shade
Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*This section shows where populations naturally occur (climate tolerance) and where species is most abundant (ecological indicators):*

**Temperature extremes**: Coldest winter night -0°C, hottest summer day 25°C
**Temperature means**: Average 26°C in warmest month, -0°C in coldest month
**Annual rainfall**: 416-1515mm/year across populations (typically 611mm)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Csb (Warm-summer Mediterranean - warm dry summers, mild wet winters)
**Cold tolerance**: Coldest populations survive -0°C winter nights (Half-hardy)
**Heat tolerance**: Hottest populations experience 25°C summer days (Cool-climate)
**Frost exposure**: 0-3 frost days/year (typically 2)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Cold spell tolerance**: Populations survive up to 7 consecutive frost days
*Short cold snaps - Can endure extended cold periods*
**Warm nights**: Essentially none (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Climate type**: Populations found where day-night temperature varies by 8-12°C (typically 10°C)
*Moderate variation climate - Typical temperate variation
**Growing season**: 275-365 days/year with temperatures suitable for growth (typically 327 - about 11 months)
*Very long - Period when temperatures allow active growth*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.7/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Annual rainfall**: 416-1515mm (typically 611mm)
  *Temperate climate*
- **Dry spells**: Typically 16 consecutive dry days, up to 26 days maximum
  *Limited - Needs moisture during 2+ week dry spells*
- Warm-wet conditions: Populations found where 2-3 days/year are warm & wet (typically 2)
  *Low disease pressure - Plant from drier climates; may be vulnerable in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 4.8/10
- Typical position: Moderate moisture
- Watering: Regular; 1-2 times weekly
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

**pH tolerance**: 5.1-7.3 (from most acidic to most alkaline population locations)
*Wide tolerance; adaptable*

---

**pH**: 5.1-7.3 (typically 6.4)
*Slightly acidic*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 5.2/10
- Typical position: Slightly acidic to neutral
- Compost: Standard multipurpose compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Fertility**: Populations found in fertile soils (CEC 24 cmol/kg)
*Good nutrient retention (clay loam) - Benefits from annual feeding*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 4.5/10
- Typical position: Moderate nutrient
- Feeding: Standard annual feeding
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

**Texture**: Populations found primarily in loam (clay ~21%)
*Moderate sand tolerance - Standard garden soil works*

## Maintenance Profile
**CSR Strategy**: C 45% / S 41% / R 14% (CS-intermediate)
**Growth Form**: Tree
**Height**: 27.1m
**Maintenance Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH (~9 hrs/yr)

**Growth Characteristics**:
- Fast, vigorous growth
- High nutrient demand
- Benefits from annual feeding

**Form-Specific Notes**:
Annual thinning to allow light below; may cast dense shade. Monitor for structural dominance; neighbours may struggle. High nutrient uptake; nearby plants may need supplemental feeding.

**Seasonal Tasks**:
- **Spring**: Feed generously, shape if needed
- **Summer**: Water in dry spells, manage spread
- **Autumn**: Hard prune if required, mulch
- **Winter**: Plan containment for vigorous growth

**Watch For**:
- May outcompete slower neighbours
- Give adequate space for mature spread
- Dense shade may exclude understory

## Guild Potential

### Summary Card

| Metric | Value | Guild Contribution |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Taxonomic | Fagaceae → Quercus | Seek different families |
| CSR Strategy | C:45% S:41% R:14% | Avoid C-C pairs |
| Structural | Canopy (27.1m) | Shade provider |
| Mycorrhizal | EMF (Ectomycorrhizal) | Connect with EMF plants |
| Pest Control | 19 pests, 0 predators | Benefits from predator plants |
| Disease Control | 0 mycoparasites | No documented antagonists |
| Pollinator | 14 taxa | Typical |

### GP1: Phylogenetic Independence

**Family**: Fagaceae
**Genus**: Quercus

**Guild Recommendation**:
- Avoid clustering plants from the same genus (highest shared pest risk)
- Diversify beyond Fagaceae for reduced pathogen transmission
- Greater taxonomic distance = lower shared vulnerability

### GP2: Growth Compatibility

**CSR Profile**: C: 45% | S: 41% | R: 14%
**Classification**: C-dominant (Competitor) (percentile-based)
**Growth Form**: Tree
**Height**: 27.1m
**Light Preference**: EIVE-L 6.2

**Companion Strategy**:
- Canopy competitor. Pairs well with shade-tolerant understory (EIVE-L < 5).
- Avoid other large C-dominant trees nearby; root and light competition.
- Vines can use as support without conflict.

**Avoid Pairing With**: Other C-dominant plants at same layer (competition). Sun-loving plants in shade zone.

### GP3: Pest Control Potential

**Observed Pests**: 19 species (High) - Multiple pest species; monitor closely

**Observed Beneficial Insects**:
- 0 predatory species observed (No data) - No predator observations (data gap)

**Guild Recommendations**:
- High pest diversity (top 10%). Benefits from companions that attract pest predators.

### GP4: Disease Control Potential

**Observed Disease Fighters**:
- 0 beneficial fungi that attack plant diseases

**Guild Recommendations**:
- No documented mycoparasitic fungi. Focus on spacing and airflow for disease prevention.

### GP5: Mycorrhizal Network

**Observed Association**: EMF (Ectomycorrhizal)
- 7 EMF species documented

**Guild Recommendations**:
- **Network-compatible plants**: Other plants with EMF associations
- **Network bonus**: Can share nutrients and defense signals with EMF-compatible neighbours
- Creates forest-type nutrient-sharing network

### GP6: Structural Role

**Layer**: Canopy (27.1m)
**Growth Form**: Tree
**Light Preference**: EIVE-L 6.2

**Guild Recommendations**:
- **Below this plant**: Shade-tolerant understory plants (EIVE-L < 5)
- **Avoid pairing with**: Sun-loving plants in the shade zone
- Creates significant shade; wind protection for neighbours

### GP7: Pollinator Support

**Observed Pollinators**: 14 species (Typical)
Average pollinator observations

**Guild Recommendations**:
- Typical pollinator observations. Good companion for other flowering plants.

**This Plant Provides**:
- Nectar/pollen source for 14 pollinator species
- Attraction effect may increase visits to neighbouring plants

### Top Companion Principles

Based on this plant's characteristics:

1. **Taxonomic diversity** - seek plants from different families than Fagaceae
2. **CSR compatibility** - avoid other C-dominant plants at same height
3. **Structural layering** - pair with shade-tolerant understory
4. **Mycorrhizal network** - seek other EMF-associated plants

### Cautions

- Avoid clustering multiple Fagaceae plants (shared pests)
- C-dominant: may outcompete slower neighbours

Open borders work well; tolerates some afternoon shade.

*Light indicator from expert field observations of typical light conditions where species is most abundant in natural vegetation*

### Climate

*Values show typical conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation from mildest to most extreme locations.*

**Temperature**: 26°C warmest month, 0°C coldest month
*Range: -2°C to 30°C across all population locations*
**Rainfall**: 611mm/year (416-1515mm across locations)

---

**Köppen Zones**: Csb (Warm-summer Mediterranean - warm dry summers, mild wet winters)
**Frost**: 2 days/year (up to 3 in coldest locations)
*Frost-free to occasional*
**Warm nights**: Rare (cool nights year-round)
*Cool nights year-round*
**Day-night swing**: 10°C typical daily range
*Temperate - moderate variation*
**Growing season**: 327 days (~11 months)
*Very long - ranges from 275 to 365 days across locations*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-T)**:
- Temperature indicator: 4.7/10
- Climate type: Temperate; typical Northern Europe
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Moisture**:

- **Dry spells**: 16 consecutive dry days typical, 26 in driest locations
  *Limited - Water during 2+ week dry periods*
- **Disease pressure**: 2 warm-wet days/year
  *Low (dry climate origin) - may be vulnerable to fungal diseases in humid gardens*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-M)**:
- Moisture indicator: 4.8/10
- Typical position: Moderate moisture
- Watering: Regular; 1-2 times weekly
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. In cultivation, plants may tolerate or even prefer different conditions. Experiment to find what works best in your garden.

### Soil

*Soil conditions where populations of the plant occur (median across populations), with range showing variation across locations. Data from SoilGrids 2.0.*

**Topsoil (0-15cm)** - *the layer you can amend*

**pH**: 6.5 typical (range 5.1-7.4)
*Slightly acidic; wide tolerance - adaptable to most garden soils*
**Fertility (CEC)**: 22 cmol/kg (19-33 across locations)
*Good retention - soil holds fertilizer well; benefits from annual feeding*
**Organic Carbon**: 41 g/kg (22-77 across locations)

**Texture**

| Component | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sand | 44% | 33-59% |
| Silt | 36% | 15-55% |
| Clay | 20% | 12-26% |

**USDA Class**: Loam
*Drainage: Good | Water retention: Good - Ideal soil; balanced drainage and retention; suits most plants*

**Triangle Coordinates**: x=45.9, y=20.3
*For plotting on USDA texture triangle; x = 0.5×clay + silt, y = clay*

---

**Profile Average (0-200cm)** - *underlying conditions*

| Indicator | Typical | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| pH | 6.5 | 5.3-7.7 |
| CEC (cmol/kg) | 20 | 14-26 |
| SOC (g/kg) | 12 | 6-27 |

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-R)**:
- pH indicator: 5.2/10
- Typical position: Slightly acidic to neutral
- Compost: Standard multipurpose compost
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; from field surveys*

**Ecological Indicator (EIVE-N)**:
- Nutrient indicator: 4.5/10
- Typical position: Moderate nutrient
- Feeding: Standard annual feeding in spring
*Where species is most abundant in natural vegetation; indicates fertility level, not preference*

**Note**: These indicators show where plants are most abundant in nature after competition. Many plants found in low-fertility areas are competitively excluded from richer soils by faster-growing species - they may actually thrive with MORE fertilization than their natural habitat suggests. pH tolerance is more physiological, but nutrient response is worth experimenting with.

## Maintenance Profile
**CSR Strategy**: C 45% / S 41% / R 14% (CS-intermediate)
**Growth Form**: Tree
**Height**: 27.1m
**Maintenance Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH (~9 hrs/yr)

**Growth Characteristics**:
- Fast, vigorous growth
- High nutrient demand
- Benefits from annual feeding

**Form-Specific Notes**:
Annual thinning to allow light below; may cast dense shade. Monitor for structural dominance; neighbours may struggle. High nutrient uptake; nearby plants may need supplemental feeding.

**Seasonal Tasks**:
- **Spring**: Feed generously, shape if needed
- **Summer**: Water in dry spells, manage spread
- **Autumn**: Hard prune if required, mulch
- **Winter**: Plan containment for vigorous growth

**Watch For**:
- May outcompete slower neighbours
- Give adequate space for mature spread
- Dense shade may exclude understory

## Ecosystem Services

*How this plant contributes to garden health and environmental benefits. Ratings derived from functional traits and growth strategy (CSR scores).*

### Productivity
**Net Primary Productivity**: Very High (5.0)
*Rapid growth produces abundant biomass each year—more leaves, stems, and roots. Provides food for wildlife, improves air quality, and captures significant carbon from the atmosphere.*
**Decomposition Rate**: High (4.0)
*Fast litter breakdown returns nutrients to soil quickly, keeping it fertile and reducing fertilizer needs. Supports active earthworms and soil microbes.*

### Nutrient Dynamics
*How efficiently nutrients move through your garden—from soil to plants to decomposers and back. Good cycling creates a self-sustaining system.*

- **Nutrient Cycling**: High (4.0)
- **Nutrient Retention**: High (4.0) - holds nutrients well; reduces fertilizer needs
- **Nutrient Loss Risk**: Moderate (3.0) - moderate loss potential

### Carbon Storage
*Plants capture CO₂ from the atmosphere. Some store it in living tissue (biomass), others contribute long-lasting carbon to soil.*

- **Living Biomass**: High (4.0) - large, dense growth captures significant CO₂; creates habitat and shade
- **Long-term Soil Carbon**: Moderate (3.0) - some long-lasting carbon contribution
- **Total Carbon Benefit**: High (4.0)

### Soil Services
**Erosion Protection**: High (4.0)
*Extensive roots and ground cover anchor soil, protecting topsoil during storms and preventing sediment runoff to waterways. Excellent for slopes.*
**Nitrogen Fixation**: Unable to Classify
*Does not fix atmospheric nitrogen. Benefits from nitrogen-fixing companion plants.*

**Garden Value**: Good choice - good carbon storage for climate-conscious planting; fast-growing for quick establishment; excellent for slopes and erosion-prone areas.

- Nectar/pollen source for 14 pollinator species
- Attraction effect may increase visits to neighbouring plants

### Top Companion Principles

Based on this plant's characteristics:

1. **Taxonomic diversity** - seek plants from different families than Fagaceae
2. **CSR compatibility** - avoid other C-dominant plants at same height
3. **Structural layering** - pair with shade-tolerant understory
4. **Mycorrhizal network** - seek other EMF-associated plants

### Cautions

- Avoid clustering multiple Fagaceae plants (shared pests)
- C-dominant: may outcompete slower neighbours

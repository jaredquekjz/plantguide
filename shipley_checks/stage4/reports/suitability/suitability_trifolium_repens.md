## Growing in Singapore (Tropical)

### Climatic Zone: Not Observed
Your Tropical climate differs from where this plant is observed.
Plant occurs in: Mediterranean, Humid Temperate, Continental zones.

### Temperature: Outside Observed Range

| Parameter | Your Location | Plant Range (5th-95th) | Typical |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Frost days | 0 ↓ | 0–5 | 3 |
| Warm nights (>20°C) | 365 ↑ | 0–3 | 0 |
| Growing season (days) | 365 ✓ | 164–365 | 260 |
| Warmest month (°C) | 31.0 ✓ | 19.6–33.7 | 26.6 |
| Coldest month (°C) | 26.0 ↑ | -17.4–6.5 | -3.8 |

**Severe (veto factors):**
- This plant is not found in locations with year-round warm nights

### Moisture: Marginal

| Parameter | Your Location | Plant Range (5th-95th) | Typical |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Annual rainfall (mm) | 2340 ↑ | 443–1539 | 934 |
| Max dry spell (days) | 14 ✓ | 8–28 | 13 |
| Max wet spell (days) | 10 ✓ | 5–16 | 7 |

**Issues:**
- Wetter than typical occurrence locations

**Recommendations:**
- Good drainage essential

### Soil Chemistry: Marginal

| Parameter | Your Location | Plant Range (5th-95th) | Typical |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Soil pH | 5.5 ✓ | 4.8–6.9 | 5.7 |
| CEC (cmol/kg) | 12.0 ↓ low | 14.8–44.3 | 27.7 |

**Fertility**: Lower fertility than typical

**Amendments:**
- Low fertility - add compost, feed little and often

### Soil Texture: Good Match
Your soil: Clay Loam (Heavy but fertile; improve drainage with grit or organic matter)

### Overall: Not Recommended
Conditions differ significantly from where this plant is observed. Consider species native to your climate zone.

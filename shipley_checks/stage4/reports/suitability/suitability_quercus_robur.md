## Growing in Singapore (Tropical)

### Climatic Zone: Not Observed
Your Tropical climate differs from where this plant is observed.
Plant occurs in: Mediterranean, Humid Temperate zones.

### Temperature: Outside Observed Range

| Parameter | Your Location | Plant Range (5th-95th) | Typical |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Frost days | 0 ↓ | 0–3 | 2 |
| Warm nights (>20°C) | 365 ↑ | 0–0 | 0 |
| Growing season (days) | 365 ✓ | 275–365 | 327 |
| Warmest month (°C) | 31.0 ↑ | 23.0–30.5 | 26.5 |
| Coldest month (°C) | 26.0 ↑ | -2.5–5.0 | -0.4 |

**Severe (veto factors):**
- This plant is not found in locations with year-round warm nights

### Moisture: Marginal

| Parameter | Your Location | Plant Range (5th-95th) | Typical |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Annual rainfall (mm) | 2340 ↑ | 416–1515 | 611 |
| Max dry spell (days) | 14 ✓ | 11–26 | 16 |
| Max wet spell (days) | 10 ✓ | 7–16 | 10 |

**Issues:**
- Wetter than typical occurrence locations

**Recommendations:**
- Good drainage essential

### Compatible Growth Strategies [M2 - 100.0/100]

No CSR strategy conflicts (100th percentile compatibility)  
Plants have compatible growth strategies: 7 Stress-tolerant-dominant (high CSR values: >75th percentile). CSR strategies measure how plants allocate resources to Competitive growth, Stress tolerance, or Ruderal (disturbance) strategies. Compatible strategies reduce resource competition.  

*Evidence:* Compatibility score: 100.0/100. Compatible growth strategies allow plants to coexist with minimal competition.

### Natural Insect Pest Control [M3 - 0.0/100]

0th percentile biocontrol capacity  
Plants attract beneficial insects (predators and parasitoids) that naturally suppress pest populations. Limited biocontrol - few documented predators/parasitoids, may need supplemental pest management  

*Evidence:* Biocontrol score: 0.0/100. Higher scores indicate more documented predator-pest relationships.

#### Biocontrol Network Profile

*Qualitative information about pest control (influences M3 scoring)*

**Summary:**
- 4 unique predator species
- 0 unique entomopathogenic fungi species

**Mechanism Summary:**
- 0 general entomopathogenic fungi (broad-spectrum biocontrol, weight 0.2)

### Natural Disease Suppression [M4 - 63.3/100]

63th percentile pathogen control via 4 antagonistic mechanisms  
Plants harbor beneficial fungi that antagonize pathogens, reducing disease incidence through biological control. Good disease suppression - beneficial fungi provide meaningful pathogen control  

*Evidence:* Pathogen control score: 63.3/100, covering 4 mechanisms. Higher scores indicate more documented mycoparasite-pathogen relationships.

#### Pathogen Control Network Profile

*Qualitative information about disease suppression (influences M4 scoring)*

**Summary:**
- 1 unique mycoparasite species (fungi that parasitize other fungi)
- 22 unique pathogen species in guild

**Mechanism Summary:**
- 0 Specific antagonist matches (pathogen → known mycoparasite or fungivore, weight 1.0)
- 1 General mycoparasite fungi (primary mechanism, weight 0.5)

**No specific pathogen-antagonist matches found.**
The disease suppression score is driven by the presence of **general mycoparasitic fungi** (e.g., Trichoderma) which provide broad-spectrum protection against fungal pathogens.

**Network Hubs (plants harboring most mycoparasites):**

| Plant | Mycoparasites | Pathogens |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Alyxia ruscifolia (Chain Fruit) | 1 | 2 |
| Carex mucronata | 0 | 4 |
| Eucalyptus melanophloia (Silver-leaved Ironbark) | 0 | 1 |
| Hibbertia diffusa (Wedge Guinea Flower) ⚠️ | 0 | 0 |
| Juncus usitatus (Australian Rush) ⚠️ | 0 | 0 |
| Senna artemisioides (Silver Cassia) | 0 | 1 |
| Sporobolus compositus (Composite Dropseed) | 0 | 15 |

⚠️ **Data Completeness Note:** Plants marked with ⚠️ have no interaction data in this dimension. This likely indicates a data gap rather than true ecological absence.

### Beneficial Mycorrhizal Network [M5 - 45.0/100]

16 shared beneficial fungal species connect 4 plants (45th percentile)  
Shared beneficial fungi (mycorrhizal partners, endophytes, and saprotrophs) create underground networks that facilitate nutrient exchange, water sharing, and chemical communication between plants. Moderate fungal network - some shared fungi present but connectivity may be limited  

*Evidence:* Network score: 45.0/100, coverage: 57.1%. Higher scores indicate more shared fungal species.

### Structural Diversity [M6 - 46.1/100]

3 growth forms spanning 19.8m height range (46th percentile)  
**Vertical Stratification (Quality: 0.36 - Poor):**

**Canopy Layer (>15m):**
  - Eucalyptus melanophloia (Silver-leaved Ironbark): 20.0m, EIVE-L: 8.2 (sun-loving ⚠)

**Understory (5-15m):**
  - Alyxia ruscifolia (Chain Fruit): 5.0m, EIVE-L: 7.4 (flexible)

**Shrub Layer (1-5m):**
  - Senna artemisioides (Silver Cassia): 2.6m, EIVE-L: 8.7 (sun-loving ⚠)
  - Juncus usitatus (Australian Rush): 1.1m, EIVE-L: 7.1 (flexible)

**Ground Layer (<1m):**
  - Sporobolus compositus (Composite Dropseed): 0.9m, EIVE-L: 8.3 (sun-loving ⚠)
  - Hibbertia diffusa (Wedge Guinea Flower): 0.3m, EIVE-L: 6.9 (flexible)
  - Carex mucronata: 0.2m, EIVE-L: 9.5 (sun-loving ⚠)

**Why this stratification has issues:**
3 plants are flexible (EIVE-L 3.2-7.47) and tolerate partial shade. ⚠ 4 plants are sun-loving (EIVE-L >7.47) and may be shaded out by taller plants.

*Evidence:* Structural diversity score: 46.1/100, stratification quality: 0.36

Moderate structural diversity - some layering present but coverage may be limited  

*Evidence:* Structural diversity score: 46.1/100. Higher scores indicate more growth forms and better vertical stratification.

### Pollinator Support [M7 - 0.0/100]

0 shared pollinator species (0th percentile)  
Plants attract and support overlapping pollinator communities, ensuring reliable pollination services and promoting pollinator diversity. Limited pollinator support - few documented shared pollinators, plants may rely on different visitors  

*Evidence:* Pollinator support score: 0.0/100. Higher scores indicate more shared pollinator species.

Plants harbor beneficial fungi that antagonize pathogens, reducing disease incidence through biological control. Excellent disease suppression - abundant antagonistic fungi provide strong pathogen control  

*Evidence:* Pathogen control score: 95.1/100, covering 6 mechanisms. Higher scores indicate more documented mycoparasite-pathogen relationships.

#### Pathogen Control Network Profile

*Qualitative information about disease suppression (influences M4 scoring)*

**Summary:**
- 2 unique mycoparasite species (fungi that parasitize other fungi)

### Structural Diversity [M6 - 100.0/100]

4 growth forms spanning 22.8m height range (100th percentile)  
**Vertical Stratification (Quality: 1.00 - Excellent):**

**Canopy Layer (>15m):**
  - Fraxinus excelsior (Ash): 23.1m, EIVE-L: 4.5 (flexible)

**Understory (5-15m):**
  - Diospyros kaki (Japanese Persimmon): 12.0m, EIVE-L: 7.4 (flexible)

**Shrub Layer (1-5m):**
  - Deutzia scabra (Deutzia): 2.1m, EIVE-L: 5.4 (flexible)

**Ground Layer (<1m):**
  - Anaphalis margaritacea (Pearly Everlasting): 0.6m, EIVE-L: 7.4 (flexible)
  - Rubus moorei (Bush Lawyer): 0.5m, EIVE-L: 6.4 (flexible)
  - Maianthemum racemosum (False Solomon's Seal): 0.4m, EIVE-L: 4.9 (flexible)
  - Mercurialis perennis (Dog's Mercury): 0.3m, EIVE-L: 1.8 (shade-tolerant ✓)

**Why this stratification works well:**
1 plant is shade-tolerant (EIVE-L <3.2) and thrive under canopy. 6 plants are flexible (EIVE-L 3.2-7.47) and tolerate partial shade. No sun-loving plants that would be shaded out.

*Evidence:* Structural diversity score: 100.0/100, stratification quality: 1.00

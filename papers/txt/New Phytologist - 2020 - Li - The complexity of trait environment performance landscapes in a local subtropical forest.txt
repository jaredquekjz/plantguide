Summary
 That functional traits should affect individual performance and, in turn, determine ﬁtness
and population growth, is a foundational assumption of trait-based ecology. This assumption
is, however, not supported by a strong empirical base.
 Here, we measured simultaneously two individual performance metrics (survival and
growth), seven traits and 10 environmental properties for each of 3981 individuals of 205
species in a 50-ha stem-mapped subtropical forest. We then modelled survival/growth as a
function of traits, environments and trait 9 environment interactions, and quantiﬁed their rel-
ative importance at both the species and individual levels.
 We found evidence of alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks along
environmental gradients, indicating the presence of complicated trait 9 environment interac-
tions. However, such interactions were relatively unimportant in our site, which had relatively
low environmental variations. Moreover, individual performance was not better predicted,
and trait 9 environment interactions were not more likely detected, at the individual level than
at the species level.
 Although the trait 9 environment interactions might be safely ignored in relatively homoge-
neous environments, we encourage future studies to test the interactive effects of traits and
environments on individual performances and lifelong ﬁtness at larger spatial scales or along
experimentally manipulated environmental gradients.
Introduction
The trait-based approach has emerged as a promising way to
understand the mechanisms of species coexistence and processes
of community assembly (McGill et al., 2006; Laughlin et al.,
2012; Kraft et al., 2015; Lusk & Laughlin, 2017), to predict the
distribution of organisms along environmental gradients (Chapin
et al., 1993; Westoby et al., 2002), and to explain the relationship
between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Lavorel &
Garnier, 2002; Cadotte, 2017). This approach is built on the
assumption that ‘functional’ traits should affect individual perfor-
mance (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction), which in turn
determine ﬁtness and population growth (Violle et al., 2007;
Laughlin & Messier, 2015; Shipley et al., 2016; Struckman et al.,
2019; Treurnicht et al., 2020). The entire discipline of trait-
based ecology will be at risk if this foundational assumption is
not reinforced by a strong empirical base (Shipley et al., 2016),
which is still weak and fragmentary. For instance, those studies
that empirically tested this assumption have reported typically
weak or nonexistent trait–performance relationships (e.g. Poorter
et al., 2008; Kraft et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2010; Adler et al.,
2014; Paine et al., 2015).
One important reason why traits alone might poorly predict
performance is that the effects of traits on individual performance
should depend on the environment (Laughlin & Messier, 2015;
Yang et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020), because no organism
would have optimal adaptation to all relevant environments at the
same time (i.e. a Darwinian demon). Recently, a few empirical
studies have detected signiﬁcant interactive effects between some
traits and environments on individual performance (Blonder et al.,
2018; Laughlin et al., 2018; Zirbel & Brudvig, 2020). For exam-
ple, speciﬁc leaf area is positively related to survival probability at
low soil C : N ratio, but negatively correlated to survival probabil-
ity at high soil C : N ratio (Laughlin et al., 2018). However, these
studies consider only interactions between one trait and one envi-
ronment, ignoring the multidimensional nature of phenotypic
traits and environments (Laughlin, 2014; Laughlin & Messier,
2015). Therefore, testing the interactive effects of multiple traits

important next step towards understanding the effects of whole-or-
ganism phenotypes on individual performance in different envi-
ronments (Laughlin et al., 2018). Speciﬁcally, the inclusion of
such higher-order interactions between traits and environments
enables us to explore performance landscapes (mapping perfor-
mance on multiple trait axes) and the possibility of multiple optima
along environmental gradients (Laughlin & Messier, 2015). Each
optimum represents an alternative functional design (a speciﬁc trait
combination) of approximately equal performance in a given envi-
ronment (Marks & Lechowicz, 2006). To our knowledge, Worthy
et al. (2020) is the only example to date that has empirically tested
higher-order trait 9 trait 9 environment interactions and found
evidence of alternative designs and multiple growth performance
peaks. That study did not consider other performance metrics
besides growth nor the multidimensional nature of the environ-
ment. Therefore, more comprehensive studies that test the interac-
tive effects of multiple traits and multiple environments on
different measures of individual performances are necessary.
One practical barrier that hinders the empirical test of
trait 9 environment interactions (especially the higher-order
interactions) is the difﬁculty of obtaining sufﬁcient data regard-
ing individual performances, traits and environments for accurate
estimation of numerous parameters (Laughlin et al., 2018).
Therefore, it is not enough to just simply identify such signiﬁcant
trait 9 environment interactions, as done in previous studies
(Blonder et al., 2018; Laughlin et al., 2018; Worthy et al., 2020;
Zirbel & Brudvig, 2020). It is also necessary to explicitly quantify
the relative importance of such trait 9 environment interactions
to individual performance, because this tells us how much infor-
mation one might lose when ignoring these complicated
trait 9 environment interactions. If trait 9 environment interac-
tions contribute little information to the prediction of individual
performance, we can ignore these interactions without introduc-
ing substantial bias of estimating trait–performance relationships.
For example, these interactions might be safely ignored in sites
with relatively homogenous environments because the impor-
tance of trait 9 environment interactions for predicting plant
performance would logically increase with the heterogeneity of
environments.
Otherwise,
trait 9 environment
interactions
would be necessary despite the challenge of obtaining sufﬁcient
data. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies quantify-
ing the relative importance of trait 9 environment interactions to
know when such interactions can be safely ignored.
Another reason for the surprisingly weak trait–performance
relationships reported so far is the shortcut of characterising all
individuals of a species with its species mean trait value (Yang
et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020). This shortcut implicitly
assumes that interspeciﬁc trait variation is far greater than
intraspeciﬁc trait variation. However, intraspeciﬁc trait variation,
arising from phenotypic plasticity and genetic diversity, has been
acknowledged as a substantial source of trait variation in a grow-
ing number of studies (e.g. Albert et al., 2010; Messier et al.,
2010; Siefert et al., 2015). Moreover, phenotypic plasticity may
enable individuals of a species to adjust their trait values to a cer-
tain extent in order to better adapt to their local environments
(Gratani, 2014), and thus trait–performance relationships will
likely be stronger when evaluated at the individual level (Yang
et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020). However, few studies have
empirically tested trait–performance relationships at both the
species and individual levels to see if the models using individual
level traits would outperform the ones using species mean traits
(but see Liu et al., 2016), and further tested if trait 9 environ-
ment interactions are more likely to be detected at the individual
level than at the species level.
In this study, we measured two performance metrics (survival
and growth), seven traits and 10 environmental properties for
each of 3981 individuals of 205 species in a 50-ha stem-mapped
subtropical forest plot. Using this large dataset, we modelled size-
dependent individual survival/growth as a function of traits, envi-
ronments and their interactions (including the higher-order ones)
at both the species and individual levels to address the following
questions:
(1) Do alternative functional designs (multiple performance
peaks) exist in a given environment and (if exist) how do they
shift along multiple environmental gradients?
A single optimum for a given environment and different
optima for different environments are often assumed in single
trait and environment analyses (Enquist et al., 2015; Laughlin,
2018). With the inclusion of higher-order trait 9 trait 9 environ-
ment 9 environment interactions, alternative functional designs
are expected for a given environment and either same or different
optima are possible for different environments.
(2) What is the relative importance of the trait 9 environment
interactions to individual survival and growth?
Their relative importance is expected to decline with decreas-
ing environmental heterogeneity and might be safely ignored in
relatively homogenous environments.
(3) Are individual survival and growth better predicted, and
trait 9 environment interactions more likely detected, at the indi-
vidual level than at the species level?
This would be true when intraspeciﬁc trait variation is substan-
tial responding to the changing environments.
Materials and Methods
Study site
The study was conducted in a 50-ha forest dynamic plot within
the Heishiding Provincial Nature Reserve (23°270N, 111°520E;
altitude: 150–927 m asl), Guangdong Province, southern China.
The region has a subtropical moist monsoon climate with a mean
annual temperature of 19.6°C and mean annual precipitation of
c. 1740 mm. The monthly mean temperature ranges from
10.6°C in January to 28.4°C in July, and the precipitation falls
predominantly (79%) from April to September. The vegetation,
characterised by an evergreen broadleaved forest, is dominated by
the Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Theaceae families.
Demographic data
The 50-ha plot (1000 m 9 500 m) was established following the
ForestGEO (https://www.forestgeo.si.edu) protocol in 2011.

The ﬁrst census was completed in 2013 with all free-standing
individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) more than
1 cm being tagged, mapped, measured and identiﬁed to species.
About 273 000 free-standing stems belonging to 245 species, 160
genera and 71 families were recorded. The second census was ﬁn-
ished in 2017, in which we recorded the status (0 for dead and 1
for alive) and DBH of all individuals recorded in the ﬁrst census.
The individual relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated as [log
(DBH2)log(DBH1)]/5, where DBH1 and DBH2 are DBH
recorded in the two censuses.
Functional traits
We measured seven traits including speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf
nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration
(LPC), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA), wood
density (WD) and wood dry matter content (WDMC), on
3981 individuals of 205 species randomly distributed within the
50-ha plot (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Details on how
these traits were sampled and measured can be found in our
previous studies (Chen, 2015; He & Deane, 2016; He &
Biswas, 2019). These traits have been reported to have effects
on survival and growth rates (Poorter et al., 2008; Kraft et al.,
2010; Wright et al., 2010; Adler et al., 2014). For example,
light-demanding species with high growth and mortality rates
tend to have larger SLA and LNC, but smaller WD than shade-
tolerant species with low growth and mortality rates (Adler
et al., 2014). We performed principal component analyses for
these traits and found that the ﬁrst two principal components
captured 64% variation of the seven traits (Fig. 1a). One dimen-
sion runs from individuals with ‘conservative’ leaves (low SLA,
LNC and LPC, and high LDMC) to individuals with ‘acquisi-
tive’ leaves (high SLA, LNC and LPC, and low LDMC), corre-
lated with the world-wide leaf economics spectrum (Wright
et al., 2004; Shipley et al., 2006; Dıaz et al., 2016). The other
dimension runs from individuals with low LA, high WD and
WDMC to individuals with high LA, low WD and WDMC.
This negative relationship between LA and WD has been
reported in some previous studies (Cavender-Bares et al., 2004;
Pickup et al., 2005; Wright et al., 2007), probably because indi-
viduals with lower wood density usually have higher hydraulic
conductivity and thus can transport more water to support
larger leaves (Wright et al., 2007).
Environmental conditions
In total, 625 surface soil samples (0–10 cm depth), randomly dis-
tributed within the 50-ha plot, were collected during the summer
of 2016. Nine soil properties for each soil sample were measured
with detailed methods shown in Table S1. Two orthogonal soil
properties (Fig. 1b), soil organic matter (SOM) and soil acidity
(pH), were selected in the following analyses. Soils with higher
SOM had more total nitrogen, total phosphorus and available
nitrogen, while soils with higher pH had more available phospho-
rus, available potassium and higher sand content. In addition, the
understory light availability was estimated using hemispherical
photography at 2352 places randomly distributed within the 50-ha
plot (Zhao & He, 2016). The SOM, soil pH and light availability
were interpolated to grids of 10 m 9 10 m using the Ordinary
Kriging in the AUTOMAP package (Hiemstra et al., 2009) to estimate
the environmental conditions in which the individuals were
located; predictions in the grids that contained observations were
replaced with the average of the observations in the grids (Fig. S1).
Data analysis
To explore interactive effects of multivariate traits and multivari-
ate environments, we modelled individual performance (Z, sur-
vival or growth) as a function of: (1) a size effect (DBH), (2)
main effects of two traits (T1 and T2) and two environments (E1
and E2), as well as (3) their two-way, (4) three-way, and (5) four-
way interactions with a general form:
We built linear mixed models of individual performance, treat-
ing survival (0 for death and 1 for survival) as a binomial-family
model with a logit link function and growth (log-transformation
of RGR) as a Gaussian-family model with an identity link func-
tion, respectively. Two random effects were considered. First, we
included random intercepts across species (cspecies) to account for
species-level differences in survival and growth that were unre-
lated to the traits. Second, we divided the 50-ha plot into 1250
(20 m 9 20 m) quadrats and included random intercepts across
quadrats (dquadrat) to account for spatial autocorrelation. We
computed the R2-marginal (variance explained by all the ﬁxed
effects) and R2-conditional (variance explained by both ﬁxed and
random effects) using the function r.squaredGLMM in the
MUMIN package (Zuur et al., 2009). We further partitioned the
R2-marginal to quantify the relative contribution of the size effect

(DBH), main effects of two traits and two environments, and
their two-way, three-way and four-way interactions to the vari-
ance explained by ﬁxed effects (Notes S1).
The above analyses were repeated for 36 models with different
combinations of two independent traits (T1 and T2) and two
independent environments (E1 and E2) for individual survival
and growth, respectively. The ﬁrst trait of the pair (T1) was
selected from the four traits relating to the ﬁrst dimension (SLA,
LNC, LPC and LDMC) and the second trait of the pair (T2) was
selected from the three traits relating to the second dimension
(LA, WD and WDMC) (Fig. 1a). The two environments (E1
and E2) were the pairwise combinations of SOM, pH and light.
The predictors DBH, LA, SLA, LNC and LPC and light avail-
ability were log-transformed to better approximate normality and
all ﬁxed predictors were then scaled to unit variance before analy-
ses. To control the false discovery rate, we adjusted the P-values
for each parameter estimation of 36 models using the Ben-
jamini–Hochberg correction (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995;
Chen et al., 2017). All these models were run at both the species
and individual levels. To explore the occurrence of alternative
functional designs and multiple performance peaks, we con-
structed 3D plots (performance landscapes) displaying how logit-
survival or log-RGR varied along with two trait axes at four
extreme environmental conditions (combinations of minimum
and maximum observed values of the two environmental vari-
ables used in the model) in the PLOT3D package (Soetaert, 2019).
All analyses were done in R v.3.6.2 (R Core Team, 2019).
Results
Summary of individual performance models
The standardised coefﬁcients, their signiﬁcance and model ﬁt
statistics of the 36 models (Z  DBH + T1 9 T2 9 E1 9 E2) for
survival and growth at both the species and individual levels are
summarised in Tables S2–S5. Individual size (DBH) was always
positively correlated with survival probability but negatively cor-
related with RGR (Tables S2–S5). Out of the 36 survival models,
most of them detected signiﬁcant main effects (of traits rather
than environments), but only a few models detected signiﬁcant
two-way, three-way and four-way interactions at both the species
and individual levels (Table 1). Modelling survival probability at
the individual level did not detect more trait 9 environment
interactions (except for the three-way interactions) than at the
species level (Table 1). Out of the 36 growth models, most of
them detected the signiﬁcant main effects of traits or environ-
ments and their two-way interactions, but a few models detected
signiﬁcant
three-way
and
four-way
interactions
(Table 1).
Modelling RGR at the individual level did not increase the detec-
tion of two-way, three-way or four-way interactions than at the
species level. In addition, both survival and growth were only
slightly better modelled (the R2-marginal and R2-conditional
were higher) at the individual level than at the species level in
most cases (Tables S2–S5).
Performance landscapes at extreme environmental
conditions
We selected one survival model and one growth model with sig-
niﬁcant four-way interaction as an example to display the perfor-
mance landscapes and explore the occurrence of functional
alternative designs and performance peaks along environmental
gradients. For the survival model with a signiﬁcant four-way
interaction between LNC, WDMC, SOM and pH at the species
level, we found two survival peaks in each of the four extreme
environments (Fig. 2). Speciﬁcally, in environments with mini-
mum observed values of SOM and pH (or maximum SOM and
pH), the survival probability peaked for individuals of high LNC
Fig. 1 Principal component analyses of seven traits (a) and nine soil properties (b). The seven traits, that is leaf area (LA), speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf dry
matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), wood density (WD) and wood dry matter content
(WDMC), were simultaneously measured on 3981 individuals of 205 species within the 50-ha forest plot. The ﬁrst two principal components explain c.
64% of total trait variation. The nine soil properties, that is soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium
(TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and sand content (Sand), were measured for 625 soil samples randomly
collected within the 50-ha forest plot. The ﬁrst two principal components explained c. 58% of total soil variation.

and low WDMC as well as for individuals of low LNC and high
WDMC (Fig. 2a,d). In environments with maximum SOM and
minimum pH (or minimum SOM and maximum pH), the sur-
vival probability peaked for individuals of low LNC and low
WDMC as well as for individuals of high LNC and high
WDMC (Fig. 2b,c). For the growth model with a signiﬁcant
four-way interaction between SLA, WD, pH and light at the
species level, we also found two growth peaks in each of four
extreme environments (Fig. 3). In environments with minimum
observed values of pH and light (or maximum pH and light), the
RGR peaked for individuals of low SLA and WD as well as for
individuals of high SLA and WD (Fig. 3a,d). While in environ-
ments with maximum pH and minimum light (or minimum pH
and maximum light), the RGR peaked for individuals of low
SLA and high WD as well as for individuals of high SLA and low
WD (Fig. 3b,c).
Relative importance of trait 9 environment interactions
On average, the ﬁxed and random effects explain c. 30% of the
variation in survival and growth at both the species and individ-
ual levels (Fig. 4). We further portioned the variance explained
by ﬁxed effects to estimate the relative contribution of the size
effect (DBH), the main effects of two traits and two environ-
ments and their interactions. For the survival models analysed at
the species level, the explained variance due to the size effect
(DBH), main effects of two traits and two environments and
their interactions (sum of two-way, three-way and four-way inter-
actions) were, on average, 41%, 43% and 16%, respectively
(Fig. 4a). The results at the individual level were generally the
same as the results at the species level (Fig. 4b). However, the
trait 9 environment interactions on average accounted for less
than 5% of the explained variance of the growth models

effect (DBH) accounted for the majority (c. 90%) of the

Discussion
Despite the importance of trait 9 environment interactions to
individual performance and the resulting population dynamics
and composition of communities (Laughlin & Messier, 2015;
Shipley et al., 2016), such interactions have been empirically
tested in only a few studies (Blonder et al., 2018; Laughlin et al.,
2018; Worthy et al., 2020; Zirbel & Brudvig, 2020). By measur-
ing the two individual performance metrics (survival and
growth), seven functional traits and 10 environmental conditions
for thousands of individuals in a subtropical forest, we have been
able to explicitly test for more complicated interactions at both
the species and individual levels. Because of the high levels of sta-
tistical power provided by our data (Notes S2; Fig. S2), we
detected a few signiﬁcant two-way (e.g. an interaction between
LDMC and SOM on individual survival at the species level),
three-way (e.g. an interaction between LPC, pH and light on
individual survival at the species level), and four-way interactions
(e.g. an interaction between LNC, WDMC, SOM and pH on
individual survival at the species level) involving the survival and
growth models at both the species and individual levels (Tables 1,
S2–S5).
Two-way (one trait 9 one environment) interactions had been
reported to affect individual survival probability (Laughlin et al.,
2018), seedling establishment (Zirbel & Brudvig, 2020) and
multiple demographic rates (Blonder et al., 2018). With the
inclusion of three-way interactions between two traits and one
environment, Worthy et al. (2020) found alternative functional
designs and multiple growth peaks and they shifted along envi-
ronmental gradients. In our study, we found multiple perfor-
mance peaks, not only for growth but also for survival, in a few
models with signiﬁcant three-way and four-way interactions
(Table 1). As examples illustrated in 3D plots (Figs 2, 3), the per-
formance landscapes became more complicated in the presence
of signiﬁcant four-way interactions. First, the existence of alterna-
tive functional designs and multiple performance peaks (Figs 2,
3) means that there is not a single optimal trait (or trait combina-
tion) value for an environment. Given this, the correlations
between community-weighted mean traits and environments can
be unreliable estimates of the adaptive value of traits (Laughlin
et al., 2018), which requires higher-order moments of community-
level trait distributions like community-weighted variances to be
considered (Shipley, 2010; Loranger et al., 2018). Second, the
alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks
shifted along environmental gradients and thus the same strategy
might be favoured in contrasting environments (Figs 2, 3).
This surprising result contrasts with common expectations that dif-
ferent optima should be favoured in different environments and
that environmental heterogeneity increases functional diversity
(Stark et al., 2017). Finally, different performance landscapes for
survival and growth can obscure our understanding of how traits
affect lifelong ﬁtness (Caswell, 1989). Future studies should
integrate effects of traits on different measures of performance to
explore the overall ﬁtness landscapes and estimate population
growth (Struckman et al., 2019).
The presence of trait 9 environment interactions (especially
the three-way and four-way interactions) points to the potential
for the types of complications described above. Such interactions,
however, contributed a relatively small proportion of the total
explained variance in most cases in our plot (Table S6; Fig. 4).
This is good news because it means that trait–performance rela-
tionships might be simple in many situations and we may not
lose much information if we simply ignore these complicated
interactions. If this is generally true, then the estimated trait–per-
formance relationships without considering traits 9 environment
interactions in many prior studies (e.g. Poorter et al., 2008; Kraft
et al., 2010; Adler et al., 2014) did not introduce large errors in
their estimates. The above conclusion must be qualiﬁed, because
the importance of trait 9 environment interactions would logi-
cally increase with increasing environmental heterogeneity. We
suspect that the small proportion of signiﬁcant trait 9 environ-
ment interactions and their generally small contributions to indi-
vidual performance in our study, is due to the fact that our study
was conducted within a 50-ha plot in a well established forest
that had low environmental variation relative to other studies.
The coefﬁcients of variance of SOM, soil pH and light availabil-
ity are lower in our plot, relative to a pine forest in Arizona
(Laughlin et al., 2018), a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna
(Worthy et al., 2020) and abandoned ﬁelds in southwestern
Michigan (Zirbel & Brudvig, 2020) (Table S7). In addition, sig-
niﬁcant trait 9 temperature and trait 9 precipitation interactions
on individual survival were also found (Laughlin et al., 2018),
but temperature and precipitation were often assumed to be the
same at local scales like in our study. Although trait 9 environ-
ment interactions might be safely ignored in relatively homoge-
neous environments at local scales, we encourage future studies
to test the interactive effects of traits and environments on indi-
vidual performance at larger spatial scales (e.g. across forest sites)
or along experimentally manipulated environmental gradients.
Another, but less likely, reason for the unimportance of
trait 9 environment interactions is that these commonly mea-
sured traits failed to effectively capture the individual response to
the environments (Yang et al., 2018). If this was the case, the
inclusion of more relevant trait 9 environment interactions
should improve our predictions of individual performance.
Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals of a species to adjust
their traits to better adapt to local environments (Gratani, 2014),
thus trait–performance relationships can be greatly improved
(Liu et al., 2016) and trait 9 environment interactions should be
more likely to be detected at the individual level rather than at
the species level. In contrast with our expectations, we did not
observe this in our study (Tables 1, S2–S5). This also might be
due to the small environmental variation in our plot. Individual
adaptation to relatively homogeneous local environments led to
much smaller intraspeciﬁc trait variation relative to interspeciﬁc
trait variation (Fig. S3), therefore few beneﬁts were obtained
when considering this relatively small intraspeciﬁc trait variation
at the individual level. In this case, characterising trait–

performance relationships at the species level were similarly effec-
tive to that at the individual level. However, we expect that
intraspeciﬁc trait variation should be more substantial and play a
more important role in studies confronting more heterogeneous
environments at larger scales (Bolnick et al., 2011; Violle et al.,
2012; Siefert et al., 2015).
Our study conducted a comprehensive test of the trait–perfor-
mance relationship in a subtropical forest by simultaneously con-
sidering multiple performance metrics, interactions between
multivariate traits and multivariate environments at both the
species and individual levels. Although some traits and environ-
ments were found to have signiﬁcant interactive effects on indi-
vidual performance, they were not very important and inclusion
of intraspeciﬁc variation did not improve the detection and
importance of these interactions. We encourage future studies to
test the interactive effects of traits and environments on different
performance metrics at larger spatial scales (e.g. across forest sites)
or along experimentally manipulated environmental gradients,
and further integrate different measures of performance to esti-
mate their effects on lifelong ﬁtness and population growth.

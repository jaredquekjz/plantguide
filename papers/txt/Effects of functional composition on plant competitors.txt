Abstract
Ecological strategies identified by plant functional traits are valuable descriptors for 
understanding species, populations, communities, and ecosystems in response to 
environmental conditions. Ecological strategies, in conjunction with the functional 
structure of plant communities, serve as crucial tools for investigating complex rela-
tionships among the environment, vegetation, and ecosystem functions. However, it 
remains unclear whether the functional structure (specifically, community-­weighted 
mean [CWM] traits) accurately reflects the optimal ecological strategies in forest 
communities. Here, we gathered seven functional traits for each species from four 
distinct forest vegetation types across four climatic zones, including leaf area (LA), 
specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf phosphorus concentra-
tion (LPC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), wood density (WD) and maximum plant 
height (H). We based on CSR (Competitors, Stress-­tolerators, Ruderals) theory and 
“StrateFy” ordination method utilizing LA, LDMC and SLA to position them within CSR 
triangle and categorize them into four ecological strategy groups: Competitive, Stress-­
tolerant, Intermediate, and Ruderal ecological strategy groups (C-­group, S-­group, Int-­
group, and R-­group). We then determined the proportion of species in each group. 
Subsequently, we calculated the CWM trait values for the remaining four functional 
traits: WD (CWM-­WD), LPC (CWM-­LPC), LNC (CWM-­LNC) and H (CWM-­H). Non-­
metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical partitioning revealed that CWM-­WD, 
CWM-­LPC, CWM-­LNC and CWM-­H significantly influenced the ecological strate-
gies of forest communities. The synergistic interaction of CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC 
had the most significant impact on ecological strategies within forest communities. 
Notably, CWM-­WD emerged as the most crucial single CWM trait for explaining 
variation in ecological strategies within forest communities. In conclusion, our study 
demonstrates that CWM traits effectively reflect optimal CSR ecological strategies 
in forest communities across different climatic zones, with CWM-­WD serving as a

1  |  INTRODUCTION
In the context of increasing demands for global change and eco-
logical conservation researches, there is a growing body of studies 
focusing on the impact of climate change on species distribution, 
community assembly and ecosystem function (Diaz & Cabido, 1997; 
Pierce et al., 2017). With the emergency of trait-­based ecology, 
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying community dy-
namics and changes in ecosystem function has significantly ad-
vanced (Chalmandrier et al., 2017, 2022; Lavorel, 2013). Ecological 
strategies, often referred to as plant functional types, can be 
defined as groups of species with similar combinations of func-
tional traits (Guo et  al.,  2018; Han et  al.,  2021). These groups 
typically exhibit similar responses to environmental conditions 
and have analogous effects on key ecosystem processes (Diaz & 
Cabido, 1997; Grime, 1979). The functional structure of plant com-
munities, which represents the distribution of trait values within 
these communities, significantly influences ecosystem processes 
and services (Borgy et al., 2017; Dias et al., 2013). In recent years, 
there has been a growing consensus that ecological strategies and 
the functional structure of plant communities can effectively be 
employed to explore the effects of environmental factors on veg-
etation and how vegetation, in turn, affects ecosystem properties 
(Borgy et  al.,  2017; Bruelheide et  al.,  2018). Consequently, it is 
reasonable to assume that investigating the relationships between 
ecological strategies and the functional structure of plant commu-
nities represents a promising avenue for understanding and pre-
dicting the variability in vegetation composition and ecosystem 
functioning within the context of global climate change.
The competitors, stress-­tolerators, ruderals (CSR) theory stands 
as one of the most comprehensive and influential theories regarding 
adaptive plant strategies currently (Wilson & Lee, 2000). The practical 
“StrateFy” tool as a crucial component of CSR theory is globally appli-
cable to a wide range of life forms and has been subjected to global 
calibration and experimental validation (Li & Shipley,  2017; Pierce 
et al., 2017). It can efficiently classify a multitude of species into 19 
distinct ecological strategy types, relying solely on three traits: leaf 
area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and specific leaf area (SLA). 
Consequently, CSR theory in conjunction with the “StrateFy” tool 
provides ecologists with a common reference framework, facilitating 
quantitative comparisons of vegetation composition and commu-
nity processes across highly contrasting habitats and various scales. 
(Grime & Pierce, 2012; Pierce et al., 2017). For instance, Rosenfield 
et al. (2019), drawing upon CSR theory, discovered that distinct for-
est types in transitional zones exhibited markedly different ecolog-
ical strategies, even along a short latitudinal gradient. Zanzottera 
et al. (2021) demonstrated that diagnostic species in evergreen forest 
classes showed a convergence toward stress-­tolerant strategy, as op-
posed to deciduous forest classes that showed a tendency toward the 
competitive strategy. Wen et al. (2023), utilizing this framework, found 
that the ecological strategies of trees shifted from S/CS and CS strat-
egies to CS/CSR strategies along the succession.
Examining consistent and predictable associations between 
plant ecological strategies and environmental conditions can en-
hance our understanding of species assembly within communities 
and shed light on how global changes and other anthropogenic fac-
tors impact ecosystem functioning (Bruelheide et  al.,  2018; Diaz 
et al., 1998). However, the 19 ecological strategy types based on 
CSR theory pose a challenge in matching them with specific envi-
ronmental conditions when investigating general patterns between 
plant functioning and environmental conditions across diverse com-
munities. To address this issue, in our recent research, we employed 
CSR triangle model to classify a diverse range of species into four 
ecological strategy groups to obtain ecological strategy spectrum 
for a given area or plant community (Han, Huang, et al., 2022). The 
ecological strategy spectrum offers a straightforward approach for 
exploring and understanding the biogeographical patterns of plant 
communities and the mechanisms behind their formation. For ex-
ample, it has been demonstrated that this approach can be used to 
analyze the differences in composition of ecological strategy in typ-
ical forest vegetation across four climate zones and their relation-
ships with abiotic and biotic factors (Han, Huang, et al., 2022; Han, 
Xu, et al., 2022). As a result, assessing how variation in functional 
structure of plant communities drives changes in species' ecological 
strategy through the lens of the ecological strategy spectrum rep-
resents a practical and feasible approach.
The community-­weighted mean (CWM) trait, calculated as the 
mean trait value for species within a community weighted by their 
abundances, stands as one of the most pivotal descriptors of com-
munity functional structure (Garnier et al., 2004; Violle et al., 2007). 
Utilizing CWM trait values offers deeper insights into species distri-
butions, patterns of community diversity, and ecosystem properties 
in response to environmental conditions (Muscarella & Uriarte, 2016). 
Multiple studies have affirmed that considering species abundance 
preferred indicator. This can improve our critical insights into key ecological processes 
in forest communities using trait-­based approach.

strengthens the relationship between traits and the environment 
(Garnier et al., 2015). For instance, in comparison to the simple aver-
age traits of individual species, community-­level weighted averages 
of plant functional traits exhibit more robust correlations with insola-
tion (Ackerly et al., 2002). Furthermore, community-­level traits more 
clearly reflect the response modes of plant traits to grazing compared 
to the species level (Cingolani et al., 2005). Additionally, CWMs of 
several fundamental vegetative traits have consistently shown asso-
ciations with key ecosystem processes (e.g., Diaz et al., 2007; Garnier 
& Navas, 2012; Lavorel, 2013). For example, CWM of leaf nitrogen 
content and leaf tensile strength significantly affect litter decompos-
ability, while CWM of leaf area and root length exhibit strong rela-
tionships with soil water content (Diaz et al., 2007).
The ‘CWM-­optimality’ hypothesis (Muscarella & Uriarte, 2016) 
posits that CWM trait values can mirror the locally ‘optimal’ trait 
strategies associated with species fitness, particularly when con-
sidering multiple traits. This suggests that community-­level traits 
and trade-­offs in multivariate traits closely intertwine with species' 
strong adaptation to specific environments. The ecological strat-
egies rooted in trade-­offs among traits represent species' tactics 
for thriving and surviving in various habitats (Pierce et al., 2017). 
Optimal ecological strategies, therefore, can be viewed as the 
most effective adaptive ways that species develop for survival, 
growth and reproduction coping with their surroundings. Despite 
the frequent utilization of both ecological strategy and community 
functional structure in ecological issues, such as studying vege-
tation responses to disturbances (Barba-­Escoto et al., 2019; Ding 
et al., 2019) and the shifts of ecosystem function and services at 
a regional or global scale (Dias et al., 2013; Diaz & Cabido, 1997). 
However, the relationship between ecological strategy and com-
munity functional structure, and whether CWM traits can reflect 
optimal ecological strategies according to CSR theory, remain 
largely unexplored. Therefore, in this study, we established 200 
20 m × 20 m forest dynamic plots (FDPs) in four forest types (50 in 
each forest type) across four climatic zones in China. A dataset that 
includes functional traits and species abundance of vascular plants 
was compiled. Subsequently, we based on CSR theory and the cal-
culated CWM trait values to carry out our specific research. In the 
meantime, given plant height (H) is a key indicator for describing 
plant ecological strategies (Westoby,  1998) and relates to water 
availability and light competitive ability (Falster et al., 2017; Klein 
et al., 2015), which captures one of important aspects of plant func-
tion. And wood density has been identified as a crucial indicator of 
construction costs and structural integrity (Diaz et al., 2016), linking 
it positively to plant mechanical strength and resistance to biotic 
agents in woody species (Chave et al., 2009; Zanne et al., 2010). 
Our primary aim was to test the three following hypotheses:
1. CWM traits are directly associated with the ecological strat-
egy spectra of forests. The distinctive functions and diverse 
responses to environmental conditions of individual functional 
traits result in varying effects of each CWM trait.
2. In a forest community, the CWM trait of maximum plant height is 
a more accurate indicator of species' optimal ecological strategy 
compared to the CWM traits of leaf (i.e., leaf phosphorus con-
centration and leaf nitrogen concentration), and stem (i.e., wood 
density).
3. Forest communities characterized by higher CWM traits of wood 
density tend to host a greater number of species employing an 
S-­selected strategy, while communities with elevated CWM traits 
of maximum plant height tend to accommodate more species em-
ploying a C-­selected strategy.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  Study site and tree census plots
The study was carried out in four typical forest vegetation types 
across four distinct climatic zones (tropical, subtropical, warm-­
temperate, and cool-­temperate) from the south to the north in 
China. These typical vegetation types included: Tropical rainfor-
est (TF) situated within Bawangling Nature Reserve in Hainan; 
Subtropical evergreen-­deciduous broadleaved mixed forest 
(SF) located in Mulingzi and Xingdoushan Nature Reserves in 
Hubei; Warm-­temperate coniferous-­broadleaved mixed forest 
(WF) found within Xiaolongshan Nature Reserve in Gansu; and 
Cold-­temperate coniferous forest (CF) situated in Kanasi Nature 
Reserve in Xinjiang. All typical forest vegetation types in our study 
are natural, undisturbed old-­growth forests, free from any human 
intervention.
We established a total of 200 0.04 ha (20 m × 20 m) forest dynamic 
plots (FDPs), with 50 FDPs in each forest vegetation type. For avoiding 
spatial pseudo-­replication, we randomly selected and ensured that the 
distance between each 20 m × 20 m plot within the same forest vege-
tation type exceeded 100 m. All FDPs were established and surveyed 
in accordance with the standardized protocols provided by the Center 
for Tropical Forest Science (http://​www.​ctfs.​si.​edu/​). Within each plot, 
we meticulously identified all woody stems (excluding lianas) with a di-
ameter at breast height (DBH, i.e., diameter at 1.3 m above the ground) 
≥1 cm. We recorded their DBH, noted their precise coordinates, and 
estimated their height. We identified all species present in our study to 
species level and standardized their botanical nomenclature referring 
to the Flora of China (http://​www.​eflor​as.​org). The identify of species 
in the filed investigation relied on our investigation team and the as-
sistance of local botanists: the Xiusen Yang in Hainan, Yongmei Yi in 
Hubei Province, Anmin Li in Gansu, respectively. During the filed in-
vestigation of Xinjiang, the identifications of plant species depended 
on our investigation team. In this study, we mainly focus on woody 
species because they best represent the physiognomy and structure 
of forest communities they characterize.
2.2  |  Functional traits
We totally measured seven functional traits, including five leaf 
traits: leaf area (LA, mm2), specific leaf area (SLA, mm2 mg−1), leaf 
dry mass content (LDMC, %), Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, 

4 of 10 |    
HAN et al.
g kg−1) and leaf phosphorous concentration (LPC, g kg−1); one stem 
traits: wood density (WD, g cm−3); one whole-­plant traits: maxi-
mum plant height (H, m). For trait measurements of leaf and stem, 
we sampled evenly 10 individuals of each species across 50 FDPs 
in each forest vegetation type and then selected five mature 
healthy leaves and one 5 cm long branch with diameter between 
1 and 2 cm from each of the five individual plant. For trait meas-
urements of H, we selected evenly five tallest mature individu-
als of each species across 50 FDPs in each forest vegetation type 
and utilized clinometer to calculate their height. For species which 
were fewer than 10 and five individuals, we sampled all individuals 
for trait measurements. The collection of samples and measure-
ment of functional traits were carried out at the peak of the grow-
ing season (between August to October from 2017 to 2019). Full 
details on trait measurements referred to the standard protocols 
(Pérez-­Harguindeguy et al., 2013).
Briefly, LA (mm2) is vital for intercepting light and the most common 
metric for size spectrum (Diaz et al., 2016). SLA (mm2 mg−1) is positively 
related to potential relative growth rate (RGR; Pérez-­Harguindeguy 
et al., 2013). LDMC (%) correlates negatively with potential RGR and 
positively with leaf lifespan (Pérez-­Harguindeguy et al., 2013). SLA and 
LDMC generally represent the opposite extremes of the economics 
spectrum (Pierce et al., 2017). LA, SLA and LDMC are used to iden-
tify the ecological strategies of species surviving in habitats (Pierce 
et al., 2013, 2017). LNC (g kg−1) and LPC (g kg−1) are tightly linked to 
plant growth and play crucial roles in ecosystem function and dynam-
ics (Chen et al., 2013; Sterner & Elser, 2002). WD (g cm−3) is a core 
functional trait relating to the growth-­mortality trade-­off, which is im-
portant for the stability, defense, architecture, hydraulics, C gain and 
growth potential of plants (Pérez-­Harguindeguy et al., 2013). H (m) is 
associated with competitive ability, reproductive size and potential 
lifespan (Pérez-­Harguindeguy et al., 2013). We used the mean func-
tional trait values of all individuals in each species to represent func-
tional trait values per species.
2.3  |  Ecological strategy and ecological 
strategy spectra
We used “StrateFy” (Pierce et  al.,  2017) basing on the three leaf 
traits: LA, LDMC, SLA to identify the ecological strategy of each 
species and assign it in CSR triangle. And then, we connected the 
midpoints of three axes of the CSR triangle to divide the ternary plot 
into four parts obtaining four resultant strategy groups: competitive 
ecological strategy group (C-­group), stress-­tolerant ecological strat-
egy group (S-­group), ruderals ecological strategy group (R-­group), 
and intermediate ecological strategy group (Int-­group; Figure  1 in 
Han, Huang, et al., 2022). Subsequently, we computed the ecological 
strategy spectrum for each FDP by dividing the number of species 
(N) belonging to each ecological strategy group (C-­group, S-­group, 
Int-­group, and R-­group) by the total number of species (T) in the plot. 
The ecological strategy spectrum comprises four components: C%, 
S%, Int%, and R%, which denote the proportions of each ecological 
strategy group within an FDP. Refer to the Supplementary Materials 
for a detailed description of the calculation process.
2.4  |  Community functional structure
Community-­weighted mean traits of four functional traits: WD, LPC, 
LNC and H was used as the descriptors of functional composition.
2.5  |  Statistical analyses
2.5.1  |  Community-­weighted mean traits
We used “dbFD” function in FD package (Laliberté & Legendre, 2010) 
to calculate community CWM trait values of WD (CWM-­WD), LPC 
(CWM-­LPC), LNC (CWM-­LNC) and H (CWM-­H) for each FDP based 
on abundance.
2.5.2  |  Effects of functional composition on 
ecological strategy spectra
To explore and visualize the effect of each CWM trait on the eco-
logical strategy spectra of forests, firstly, we used non-­metric 
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination using the Bray–Curtis 
dissimilarity index to group our survey plots based on the ecologi-
cal strategy spectra of each FDP. Secondly, we model nonlinear 
correlations in ordination space between the environmental values 
(i.e., CWM-­WD, CWM-­LPC, CWM-­LNC and CWM-­H) and ecologi-
cal strategy spectra of forests. NMDS was carried out by the “met-
aMDS” function in the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2022). The 
ecological strategy spectra significance across forest vegetation 
types was assessed through permutational multivariate analysis 
of variance (PERMANOVA) via the “adonis” functions in the vegan 
package. Nonlinear correlations were modeled by the function 
“ordisurf” in the vegan package. “ordisurf” used a thin-­splined gen-
eralized additive model (GAM) to fit a smooth surface for a given 
CWM trait onto an ordination diagram for detecting distribution 
trends of species' ecological strategies in forests across different 
climatic zones.
2.5.3  |  The relatively importance of CWM traits for 
variability in ecological strategy spectra
We used “rdacca.hp” function in rdacca.hp package (Lai et al., 2022) 
to quantify the relatively importance of each CWM trait and group 
of CWM traits on the ecological strategy spectra of forests, based 
on datasets of ecological strategy spectra and CWMs for FDPs. 
Then, we used “upset_vp” function in UpSetVP package (Liu, 2022) 
to visualize the relative importance of different CWM traits for the 
ecological strategy spectra of forests.

HAN et al.
A Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to reveal the 
relationships between the CWM traits (i.e., CWM-­WD, CWM-­LPC, 
CWM-­LNC and CWM-­H) and the ecological strategy spectra of for-
ests (i.e., C%, S%, Int% and R% for FDPs). All statistical analyses were 
performed using the R environment (R Core Team, 2021) at a signif-
icance level of α = 0.05.
3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  Effects of CWMtraits on ecological strategy 
spectra of forests
The NMDS analysis revealed distinct differences in the eco-
logical strategy spectra among the four forest vegetation types 
across the four climatic zones (Stress = 0.019), particularly notice-
able between Cold-­temperate coniferous forest (CF) and Tropical 
rainforest (TF), Subtropical evergreen-­deciduous broadleaved 
mixed forest (SF) and Warm-­temperate coniferous-­broadleaved 
mixed forest (WF; Figure  1). Species in CF was dominated by 
stress-­tolerant ecological strategies (i.e., species in the S-­group [S 
species]) while TF was dominated by species exhibiting competi-
tive ecological strategies (i.e., species in the C-­group [C species]). 
Both SF and WF predominantly hosted species with intermediate 
ecological strategies (i.e., species in the Int-­group [Int species]). 
However, species with ruderal ecological strategies (i.e., species 
in the R-­group [R species]) differed from the other three eco-
logical strategy groups and were scarce, observed only in SF (see 
Figure S1).
Nonlinear correlations showed significant associations between 
the differences in the ecological strategy spectrum among the four 
forest vegetation types and the CWM traits of wood density (WD), 
leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), leaf nitrogen concentration 
(LNC), and maximum plant height (H) (see Figure 1). Specifically, TF, 
FI G U R E 1 Non-­metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) FDPs based on the ecological strategy spectra, with smooth response curves 
of the CWM traits overlain. (a) CWM trait of wood density (WD); (b) CWM trait of leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC); (c) CWM trait 
of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC); (d) CWM trait of maximum plant height (H). TF, SF, WF and CF with different colors and shapes 
represented different forest vegetation types: TF, red, circles, tropical forest; SF, yellow, squares, subtropical forest; WF, green, triangles, 
warm-­temperate forest; CF, pink, diamonds, cold-­temperate forest. C, S, Int and R with blue indicated different ecological strategy groups: 
C, competitive ecological strategy group; S, stress-­tolerant ecological strategy group; Int, intermediate ecological strategy group; R, ruderals 
ecological strategy group. WD, LPC, LNC and H represented the different CWM traits: WD, wood density. The color gradient represented 
variation of CWM traits: blue represented increased CWM trait values and yellow represented decreased. p < .01 indicated a significant 
effect. All FDPs in CF (pink diamonds) almost had similar ecological strategy spectra, thus, the point in fact, was the overlap of 50 points.

HAN et al.
SF and WF distinctly clustered with low CWM-­WD, while CF clus-
tered with high CWM-­WD (Figure 1a). TF was associated with low 
CWM-­LPC, whereas CF was linked to high CWM-­LPC. In contrast 
to TF and CF, SF and WF exhibited intermediate CWM-­LPC (see 
Figure  1b). CF was characterized by intermediate CWM-­LPC (see 
Figure 1c).
3.2  |  Relative importance of CWM traits for 
variability in ecological strategy spectra of forests
The findings indicated that the four CWMs collectively accounted 
for 93.7% of the total variation in the ecological strategy spectra 
of forests, as illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, the combined in-
fluence of CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC elucidated 49.24% of the ob-
served variation in ecological strategy spectra. Notably, CWM-­WD 
individually explained up to 35.12% of the variation in ecologi-
cal strategy spectra. Subsequently, CWM-­LPC and CWM-­LNC 
emerged as the second and third most influential CWM traits fol-
lowing CWM-­WD, contributing to 31.89% and 16.46% of the varia-
tion in ecological strategy spectra, respectively. In contrast, CWM-­H 
played a minor role, contributing only 10.26% to the observed vari-
ation (see Figure 2).
3.3  |  Relationship between CWM traits and 
ecological strategy spectra of forests
The CWM-­WD, CWM-­LPC, CWM-­LNC and CWM-­H exhibited sig-
nificant associations with Competitive (C), Stress-­tolerant (S), and 
Intermediate (Int) ecological strategy groups, as indicated in Table 1. 
Specifically, CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC demonstrated significant 
negative correlations with C and Int-­groups, while showing significant 
positive correlations with the S-­group. Notably, CWM-­WD exhib-
ited the strongest association with the Int-­group (−0.805) followed 
by the S-­group (0.774), whereas CWM-­LPC showed the most pro-
nounced association with the C-­group (−0.834) followed by the S-­
group (0.451). On the other hand, CWM-­LNC exhibited significant 
negative correlations with C and S-­groups, along with a significant 
positive correlation with the Int-­group. In contrast, CWM-­H dis-
played significant positive correlations with C and S-­groups but 
was significantly negatively correlated with the Int-­group. Both 
CWM-­LNC and CWM-­H showed the greatest associations with the 
Int-­group (0.669 and − 0.620) followed by the S-­group (−0.556 and 
0.496; see Table 1).
4  |  DISCUSSION
Our main objective was to investigate whether CWM traits could 
effectively reflect the optimal ecological strategies of species. 
Utilizing the CSR theory, we demonstrated a robust connection 
between CWM traits and the ecological strategy spectra of for-
ests. Interestingly, contrary to our second hypothesis, the results 
indicated that CWM-­WD better reflects species' ecological strat-
egy compared to CWM-­LPC, CWM-­LNC, and CWM-­H. Moreover, 
in comparison to a single CWM trait, the combined effect of 
CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC has a more pronounced impact on the 
ecological strategy spectra of forests. Further analysis unveiled a 
strong positive association of both CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC with 
the Stress-­tolerant (S) group, coupled with a negative correlation 
with the Intermediate (Int) group. This suggests that communities 
with higher CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC may tend to harbor more S-­
selected species than Int-­selected species.
Consistent with our first hypothesis, the results indicate that 
CWM traits significantly affect the ecological strategy spectra of

to elucidate variations in optimal ecological strategies in response 
to environmental changes. Prior researches (Kandlikar et al., 2022; 
Muscarella & Uriarte,  2016) support the notion that CWM traits 
serve as effective descriptors, reflecting the adaptive strategies of 
species. According to the mass ratio hypothesis (Grime, 1998), eco-
system processes in plant communities are assumed to be dictated by 
the traits of the most abundant species, those with specific resource 
use strategies. In other words, CWM traits can indicate the domi-
nant ecological strategy of species in plant communities. Likewise, 
the ‘CWM-­optimality’ hypothesis (Muscarella & Uriarte, 2016) also 
partly confirms that CWM traits in a community can reflect the opti-
mal strategies for a given environment. Our findings align with these 
previous studies, suggesting that understanding the relationships 
between CWM traits and ecological strategies can facilitate the pre-
diction of species assembling in specific communities.
One of the most significant findings in our study is that 
CWM-­WD (35.12%), rather than CWM-­H (10.26%), stands out as 
the most crucial individual CWM trait in explaining the variation 
in the ecological strategy spectra of forests (Figure 2). CWM-­WD 
was a more effective indicator for optimal ecological strategies in 
forest communities at regional scales. This finding diverges from 
our second hypothesis but aligns with previous research that iden-
tifies wood density as a reliable predictor for fundamental plant 
characteristics, including resistance to xylem damage and growth 
rate (Preston et al., 2006). Moreover, studies by Diaz et al. (2016) 
have highlighted wood density as a vital indicator of construction 
costs and structural strength, positively linked to plant mechanical 
strength, hydraulic safety, and resistance to biotic agents among 
woody species (Chave et  al.,  2009; Zanne et  al.,  2010). Although 
plant height is closely related to water use efficiency and light com-
petition ability (Falster et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2015), wood density 
also possesses these functions and has additional functionalities 
(Chave et al., 2009). Additionally, compared to H, there are stron-
ger correlations between WD and functional traits that determine 
ecological strategies (i.e., LA and LDMC; Figure S2). In light of these 
considerations, we propose that regarding CWM-­WD as a key indi-
cator reflecting the assembly of species' ecological strategies is both 
rational and acceptable for woody species in forest communities 
across four climatic zones.
Further analysis revealed a strong correlation between 
CWM-­WD and the S and Int-­groups (Table 1). Our results directly 
indicated that forest communities with higher CWM-­WD were gen-
erally dominated by species in the S-­group. Several factors contrib-
ute to this pattern. Firstly, WD exhibits a positive association with 
LDMC (Figure S2), and stress-­tolerant species are closely linked to 
LDMC (Pierce et al., 2013). Secondly, this observation aligns with 
the “mass ratio hypothesis” (Grime,  1998), suggesting that higher 
CWM-­WD in forest communities corresponds to the presence of 
more plants with high wood density. Previous research has indicated 
that plants with higher wood density confer low growth rates and 
stress resistance (Hacke & Sperry, 2001; Poorter et al., 2017; Sperry 
et al., 2008). S-­selected species are characterized by slow growth 
and high stress tolerance in challenging environments (Pierce 
et al., 2017). Therefore, plant communities with higher CWM-­WD 
tend to have more S-­selected species. Contrary to the S-­group, 
CWM-­WD was negatively correlated with the Int-­group. This can be 
attributed to the intermediate characteristics of the Int-­group, which 
falls between the extremes of the true ecological strategy groups (C, 
S, and R). Species in the Int-­group exhibit intermediate responses, 
such as wood density intermediate values, to competition, distur-
bance, and stress of similar intensities (Grime, 2001; Han, Huang, 
et  al.,  2022). Consequently, forest communities with a significant 
number of species in the Int-­group may exhibit lower CWM-­WD. 
Furthermore, our previous studies have consistently demonstrated 
that a substantial proportion of woody species in these four forest 
types belongs to the S and Int-­groups (Han, Huang, et al., 2022). This 
finding partly contributed to the substantial impact of CWM-­WD on 
the variation in the ecological strategy spectra of forests.
The combined effects of CWM-­WD and CWM-­LPC have the 
greatest impact on the ecological strategies of forest communities 
(49.24%; Figure  2). Plant traits associated with the stem and leaf 
economics spectrum are functional and significantly influence plant 
ecological strategies (Baraloto et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2004). The 
examination of “the wood economics spectrum” (Chave et al., 2009) 
encompasses wood properties related to water transport, stor-
age, mechanical strength, and defense mechanisms, forming a tri-
angle (see fig. 4 in Chave et al., 2009) that symbolizes the role of 
wood in crucial plant ecological functions-­competitive ability, stress

resistance, and disturbance resilience. Intriguingly, this happens to 
correspond to CSR theory (competitor, stress-­tolerant, and ruderal; 
Grime, 1974). Additionally, wood density, serving as an integrator 
of wood properties and stem functional traits, has been validated 
as one of the most reliable indicators of growth rate and mortality 
(Poorter et al., 2008) and is instrumental in reflecting plant perfor-
mance (Chave et al., 2009). On the other hand, robust associations 
have been identified between leaf traits and life-­history strategies 
through multivariate approaches in tropical forests with similar envi-
ronmental conditions (Rüger et al., 2018). Leaf phosphorus concen-
tration, as a key indicator representing the leaf economics spectrum, 
plays a pivotal role in plant adaptation strategies to environmental 
conditions (Pan et al., 2023; Wright et al., 2004). Our findings re-
inforce these conclusions and underscore the importance of wood 
density and leaf phosphorus concentration in comprehending the 
plant community response to ongoing global changes on a large 
scale (Chave et al., 2009).
Overall, our study delves into the reciprocal relationship be-
tween ecological strategy and community functional structure in 
regional forest communities across four climatic zones. The re-
sults illuminated tight associations between CWM traits and the 
ecological strategy spectra of forests. Comparatively, considering 
both CWM traits of stem and leaf traits collectively offers a poten-
tially more accurate predictive capacity for changes in ecosystem 
properties and functions within forest communities than focus-
ing on individual stem or leaf CWM trait. Moreover, our findings 
validate CWM-­WD as a more effective indicator for optimal eco-
logical strategies in forest communities at regional scales. This in-
sight stands to aid ecologists in advancing their comprehension of 
species adaptation and community assembly within forest ecosys-
tems. However, certain limitations persist in this study. Primarily, 
the analysis exclusively concentrates on aboveground functional 
traits, omitting belowground functional traits such as root traits 
(e.g., specific root length). Addressing this gap is a focal point for 
our future research endeavors. On the other hand, these above-
mentioned outcomes may be partially attributed to species' growth 
forms (Baraloto et al., 2010; Diaz et al., 2016) and the scale of the 
study (Westoby et  al.,  2002). In essence, while our study under-
scores the effectiveness of CWM-­WD in explaining variation in the 
ecological strategy of forest communities, divergent growth forms 
(e.g., understory herbaceous plants), study scales, or both, could 
yield disparate results. Consequently, further research with larger 
sample sizes may be necessary to provide a more comprehensive 
interpretation of these findings in the future.

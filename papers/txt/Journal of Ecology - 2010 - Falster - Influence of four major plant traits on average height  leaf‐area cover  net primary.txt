Summary
1. Numerous plant traits are known to inﬂuence aspects of individual performance, including rates
of carbon uptake, tissue turnover, mortality and fecundity. These traits are bound to inﬂuence
emergent properties of vegetation because quantities such as leaf-area cover, average height,
primary productivity and density of standing biomass result from the collective behaviour of
individuals. Yet, little is known about the inﬂuence of individual traits on these emergent properties,
despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is
deﬁned by a constellation of traits.
2. We examine the inﬂuence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood
density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf-area
index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait-, size- and patch-struc-
tured model of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual-level growth processes
and probabilistic disturbances to landscape-level predictions. A physiological growth model incor-
porating relevant trade-offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The
resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegeta-
tion dynamics.
3. We modelled single-species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size
had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not
seed-limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on
biomass density. Leaf economic strategy inﬂuenced minimum light requirement, and thus total
leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation inﬂuenced vegetation mainly by
modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes ampliﬁed,
across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval.
4. Synthesis: Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegeta-
tion, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and
disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next-generation vegetation
models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure
of vegetation.

Introduction
Emergent properties of vegetation are those that result from
the collective behaviour of individuals, such as average canopy
height, leaf-area cover, biomass production rates and biomass

density. These quantitative features are of fundamental impor-
tance in ecosystems. Autotrophic production and the vertical
structure of vegetation provide the foundations for terrestrial
biodiversity, in terms of supplying food, adjusting microcli-
mate and creating habitat. Canopies exchange heat and water
with the atmosphere, and modulate runoff and soil erosion.
Through shifting carbon concentration in the atmosphere, veg-
etation can also alter global climate over the longer term. In
summary, vegetation structure and function can inﬂuence
processes ranging from the formation and maintenance of
complex food webs to regional weather, soil development and
regulation of global climate (Shukla & Mintz 1982; Bonan
2008).
Potential inﬂuences on emergent vegetation properties
include climate, nutrient supply, disturbance regime and the
traits of component species. Species traits are perceived as
important drivers of vegetation structure, and this is illustrated
by the near-universal adoption of the functional-type para-
digm in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) (Cramer
et al. 2001; Bonan & Levis 2002; Sitch et al. 2008). Plant func-
tional types are archetypal plant species that differ from each
other in terms of their trait values. One rationale for incorpo-
rating these different types into DGVMs is their inﬂuence on
emergent vegetation properties. Trait variation is also thought
to underpin relationships widely observed in small-scale
manipulative experiments between species diversity and vari-
ous aspects of ecosystem function (Tilman et al. 1997; Hector
& Bagchi 2007). Yet, little is known about the actual inﬂuence
of individual traits on vegetation properties, despite the
implied importance of traits.
There are several reasons why it remains poorly understood
how the traits of species inﬂuence emergent properties of vege-
tation. One is that manipulative experiments at the required
spatial scale and timeframe are very difﬁcult. While numerous
experiments have used short-lived herb and grass species, most
of these studies were designed to capture the effects of species
diversity on vegetation dynamics, rather than the effects of
traits per se (reviews by Hooper et al. 2005; Hector & Bagchi
2007). A second reason is that, although most DGVMs notion-
ally include quite a large number of traits, the tradeoffs and
correlations between different traits in these models do not yet
reﬂect the big advances that were made in trait research over
the past decade. Third, but perhaps most crucially, many con-
temporary vegetation models lack the internal population
structure required for the effects of traits to be properly
described and manifested.
Scaling effectively from traits, which control the allocation
decisions of individuals, to emergent properties of vegetation
requires individual-scale growth processes to be integrated
with the population- and community-level demographic
processes determining the size distribution of plants across a
landscape (Prentice & Leemans 1990; Moorcroft, Hurtt &
Pacala 2001; Purves & Pacala 2008). Since the direct inﬂuence
of traits is on individual rates of growth, fecundity and mor-
tality, size distributions are needed to integrate these effects
over a heterogeneous population. Two of the most important
factors inﬂuencing the number and size of individuals in a
landscape are disturbance and size-asymmetric competition
for light (Goff & West 1975; Hara 1984; Shugart 1984; Coomes
& Allen 2007). By removing established individuals, distur-
bances remove standing biomass and increase local light levels,
thereby promoting growth and recruitment. Similarly, success
within developing stands depends critically on the amount of
shading from local competitors. To account for the inﬂuences
of these processes on size distributions, models would ideally
describe a continuous distribution of individual sizes. How-
ever, many vegetation models – including all major DGVMs
(reviewed by Cramer et al. 2001; Sitch et al. 2008) – group
individuals within each species into a single size class. This limi-
tation renders them unable to capture the full, dynamic effects
of competition, disturbance and trait variation on emergent
vegetation properties.
There are several ways in which size structure can be intro-
duced when modelling vegetation (Busing & Mailly 2004).
Individual-based, spatially explicit, stochastic simulators such
as SORTIE (Pacala et al. 1996) offer the greatest level of eco-
logical realism and detail. However, these models are also com-
putationally
intensive,
which
inhibits
their
widespread
application (Levin et al. 1997). Computational speed can be
improved by focussing on the vertical structure of local popu-
lations within patches of vegetation, while neglecting ﬁne-scale
spatial interactions within patches, as well as the spatial conﬁg-
uration among patches. Models taking this approach have
been widely applied since the 1970s and shown to capture a
wide range of phenomena (e.g. Shugart 1984; Huston & Smith
1987; Huston & DeAngelis 1987; Prentice & Leemans 1990;
Bugmann 2001). However, the stochastic nature of gap models
makes it difﬁcult to separate the underlying signal of ecological
processes from intrinsic random variation. Models formulated
using partial differential equations (PDEs) offer a possible
solution. By approximating individual- and patch-level pro-
cesses with PDEs, the inﬂuences of traits, climate, size-struc-
tured competition for light and probabilistic disturbance can
be analysed in a deterministic fashion (Sinko & Streifer 1967;
Levin & Paine 1974; Hara 1984; Metz & Diekmann 1986;
Kohyama 1993; Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001). Such PDE-
based models are also known as physiologically structured
population models (Metz & Diekmann 1986; de Roos 1997) or
as size- and age-structured approximations (Moorcroft, Hurtt
& Pacala 2001). These models have already been shown to pre-
dict a range of phenomena in line with empirical data, includ-
ing patterns of growth within developing stands (Hara 1984;
Yokozawa & Hara 1992) and stem-diameter distributions
(Kohyama 1993), as well as temporal patterns of species domi-
nance, biomass accumulation and net ecosystem production
(Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001; Medvigy et al. 2009).
In this study, we consider a metapopulation of patches that
are linked through dispersal and are subject to probabilistic
patch-level disturbances. The vegetation dynamics in each
patch are structured with respect to size, and potentially with
respect to traits. We therefore refer to the resultant model as a
trait-, size-, and patch-structured model (TSPM). We use such
a TSPM to examine the inﬂuence on emergent properties of
vegetation of four functional traits: leaf economic strategy,

height at maturation, wood density and seed size. These traits
have been chosen because they are known to vary widely
among species, because the underlying trade-offs are relatively
well understood and because they highlight important alterna-
tive ways of altering a plant’s life history (Westoby et al. 2002;
Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009). We chose four emergent
properties that describe some fundamental inﬂuences of vege-
tation on food webs, nutrient cycles and land-surface interac-
tions: average height of leaf area, leaf-area index (LAI), net
primary productivity (NPP) and density of standing biomass
per ground area (biomass density). Therefore, the goals of this
paper are:
1.
to derive a trait-size-patch-structured vegetation model;
2.
to quantify the modelled inﬂuence of four life-history
traits on average height of leaf area, LAI, NPP and bio-
mass density; and
3.
to assess the sensitivity of trait effects to shifts in site pro-
ductivity and disturbance frequency.
Materials and methods
We consider a trait-, size- and patch-structured metapopulation of
plants subject to probabilistic disturbances and competition for light.
As such, the model is most applicable to forests. Each element of the
model draws on well-established physiology and ecology. Figure 1

Size- and patch-structured metapopulation
We consider a spatially unstructured metapopulation consisting of a
large number of patches linked by dispersal (Fig. 1). Each patch is
assumed to contain a large number of individuals. All patches are
subject to probabilistic disturbances that remove all individuals in a
patch. For this analysis, we assume that the risk of disturbance
increases linearly with patch age, deﬁned as the time since the last dis-
turbance. Under this assumption, disturbance intervals follow a Wei-
bull probability distribution (Clark 1989), leading to an analytic
solution for the equilibrium distribution of patch ages in the meta-
population deﬁned by a single parameter: the mean disturbance inter-
val (eqn 23; see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). With the
same mean disturbance interval, different disturbance regimes cause
only small variations in the predicted age distribution (McCarthy,
Gill & Bradstock 2001), indicating that results are not particularly
sensitive to the speciﬁc function chosen. Seeds produced in all patches
contribute to a global seed rain, from which newly disturbed patches
are colonized. Seeds continue to arrive over the lifespan of a patch;
however, only seedlings able to maintain positive mass production
successfully establish (see below).
Competitive hierarchies within developing patches were modelled
by tracking the size distribution of plants, as patches age after a
disturbance (eqn 22) (Kohyama 1993; de Roos 1997; Moorcroft,
Hurtt & Pacala 2001). This distribution evolves as: (i) seedlings
enter the population after germination, (ii) growth of established
plants moves them up in the size spectrum and (iii) mortality
removes plants from the population. Growth and mortality rates
(eqn 19, 21) vary with an individual’s net dry-matter production
rate, which in turn is inﬂuenced by shading from other plants in
the patch. Following Yokozawa & Hara (1995), we let the leaf area
of each individual be distributed over its height according to a dis-
tribution governed by a single crown-shape parameter (eqn 9, 10;
see Appendix S2 in Supporting Information for details). This verti-
cal leaf-area distribution combines with the distribution of plant
sizes in the patch to give cumulative levels of shading down
through the canopy (eqn 11). The outcome of this model structure
is strong size-asymmetric competition: relatively larger plants con-
tinue to grow, while relatively smaller plants are suppressed and
removed from the stand.
Net dry-matter production is determined by three factors: an
individual’s size, its traits, and the degree of shading imposed by its
competitors (eqn 15). Gross carbon-dioxide (CO2) assimilation for
each individual is calculated by integrating instantaneous photosyn-
thetic rates, at corresponding light levels, over its leaf area (eqn 12).
Maintenance respiration, growth respiration and tissue turnover
are then accounted for in calculating net dry-matter production.
Maintenance respiration increases linearly with the total nitrogen
content of leaves, total mass of roots and total volume of sapwood
and bark (eqn 13). Bark respiration was set at twice the sapwood
respiration, in accordance with observing an average nitrogen con-
tent in bark that is approximately twice as high as that of sapwood
(Martin et al. 1998). Leaf-turnover rate was set to vary as a func-
tion of leaf mass per unit area (LMA), while bark and ﬁne-root
turnover were set to a ﬁxed rate (eqn 14). Since total leaf area
increases throughout ontogeny, potential gross assimilation also
increases. At the same time, an increasing fraction of a plant’s
mass is occupied in support tissues (stem, bark and heartwood)
(eqn 4–8), so the total burden of respiration and tissue turnover
also increases with size (Fig. S6 in Supporting Information). Conse-
quently, as size increases, the relative growth rate decreases and the
minimum light level needed to maintain a positive mass production
increases (Fig. S6).
With increasing size, individuals allocate a greater fraction of newly
produced dry matter to reproduction (eqn 16). Height at maturation
is one of the considered functional traits; around this size, allocation
to reproduction makes a rapid transition from almost 0% to 100%.
This allocation pattern closely approximates the bang-bang strategy
derived by theoretical investigations (Ma¨ kela¨ 1985; Iwasa 2000).
Fecundity rates are calculated directly from mass allocated to repro-
duction via seed mass (eqn 17). To account for the various accessory
costs of seed production, we let each unit of seed mass be accompa-
nied by a ﬁxed mass representing ﬂowers, fruits, and dispersal struc-
tures (eqn 17).
Individuals in the model are exposed to three sources of mortality:
(i) disturbance-driven mortality, which occurs at the scale of whole
patches; (ii) intrinsic mortality, which varies among species according
to their wood density, and (iii) growth-related mortality, which varies
among individuals within a patch according to their net mass pro-
duction per unit leaf area (eqn 21). The equation for intrinsic mor-
tality was motivated by an empirical relationship relating wood
density to average mortality (see Appendix S4 in Supporting Infor-
mation for details). An exponential increase in growth-related mor-
tality with declining mass production implies that this mortality
heavily affects shaded individuals (King et al. 2006; Coomes & Allen
2007; Baltzer & Thomas 2007), as well as maladapted plants. We let
growth-related mortality be determined by production per unit leaf
area, rather than by total production, so that mortality did not
depend strongly on size as such.
Survival of seedlings through germination was also made a func-
tion of production per leaf area (eqn 20). Equation 20 was chosen so
that both seedling survival and the density of plants at the smallest
size declined to zero as dry mass production declined to zero (see
Appendix S5 in Supporting Information for details). In addition,
growth, fecundity, survival through germination and density of seed-
lings at smallest size, are all set to zero when an individual’s mass pro-
duction becomes negative (eqn 17, 19, 20, 22).
Allometric relationships for plant components
Detailed modelling of size distributions (eqn 22) is facilitated when
individuals are organized along a single size dimension. However, to
calculate light interception, dry-matter production and growth rate,
we need to know the size of all plant components, including an indi-
vidual’s height, as well as the mass of its sapwood, heartwood, bark
and roots. Therefore, one component of the model was a set of allo-
metric relationships binding these various components to each other
(eqn 2–8, see Appendix S2 for derivations). Functionally, crown size
(measured in terms of total leaf area) can be thought of as the primary
indicator of an individual’s size, but in the equations of the model
each component is expressed in relation to total leaf mass, since this
resulted in simpler equations. For illustrating results we have used
stem height to express the size of individuals, as this seemed easiest
for readers to envisage.
Our allometric model is inspired by Yokozawa & Hara (1995). It
assumes ﬁxed ratios of leaf area to sapwood area (Shinozaki et al.’s
1964) and of leaf area to root mass, as well as an allocation proﬁle
between leaf area and height (eqn 3). Bark mass (including true
bark and phloem) is modelled using an analogue of the pipe model.
Heartwood mass is linked to leaf area using an empirical scaling

relationship, which amounts to a different approach from many other
models that derive heartwood growth from a rate of sapwood turn-
over. Various traits can be included to produce strategic differences in
allocation among species. However, within any species there remains
a single ontogenetic pathway along which individuals are transported
through growth processes.
The allocation model described by equations 2–8 was veriﬁed using
the Coweeta biomass dataset (Martin et al. 1998), which includes
data on plant dimensions (leaf area, sapwood mass, bark mass, heart-
wood mass, height) and traits for individuals spanning a range of sizes
in 10 different species. Within species, crown size explained an aver-
age of 73% of variation in height, 88% of variation in sapwood mass,

83% of variation in bark mass, and 61% of variation in heartwood
mass (Appendix S3 in Supporting Information). Differences in
LMA, wood density, leaf area per unit sapwood area and height-leaf
area proﬁle explained differences among species in leaf, sapwood,
bark and heartwood mass for plants of given leaf area (Appendix S3).
Thus, the model seemed to perform well in approximating allocation
patterns within and across species.
Leaf-level assimilation and site productivity
For a given canopy openness, gross annual CO2 assimilation of a leaf
was obtained by integrating instantaneous rates, calculated using a
standard rectangular hyperbola (Cannell & Thornley 1998), over the
diurnal and seasonal patterns of solar variation experienced at a given
latitude and longitude (see Appendix S6 for details). We let maxi-
mum photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area be determined by leaf
nitrogen content and by the photosynthetic nitrogen-use efﬁciency
(ratio of light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate to leaf nitrogen mass)
of the leaves (Wright et al. 2004). These maximum rates were
assumed constant for all individuals in a metapopulation, but were
adjusted up and down as a proxy for inﬂuences of climate (i.e. rain-
fall, humidity, temperature) or nutrient supply on growth, and
thereby on site productivity. Although these inﬂuences could be mod-
elled more mechanistically, by including stomatal and hydraulic sub-
models (e.g. Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001; Medvigy et al. 2009),
this level of physiological detail was deemed unnecessary for the cur-
rent study.
Traits and trade-offs
LEAF ECONOMICS
To model variation in leaf economic strategy, we let leaf turnover be
inversely related to LMA (eqn 14), while maintaining a constant
nitrogen content per unit leaf area. This relationship captures the
widely observed coordination between LMA, average leaf lifespan,
nitrogen content per unit leaf mass and maximum assimilation rate
per unit leaf mass, known as the leaf economics spectrum (Reich,
Walters & Ellsworth 1992; Wright et al. 2004). Species at the fast-
return end of the spectrum, characterized by low LMA and high
nitrogen content per unit mass, realize greater mass-speciﬁc assimila-
tion rates, but suffer from disproportionately high turnover rates and
higher leaf respiration.
WOOD DENSITY
The effects of wood density were modelled through a trade-off
between the efﬁciency of stem growth (eqn 4–6) and intrinsic mortal-
ity rate (eqn 21), with mortality increasing exponentially as wood den-
sity decreases. Two presumed costs of cheaper volumetric growth are
an increased risk of infection by pathogens or borers in the stem and
decreased structural stability (Chave et al. 2009). These costs could
lead to increased mortality rates for stems with lower wood density,
independent of the degree of shading. Supporting this idea, we found
consistent relationships between low wood density and average mor-
tality rate across species from 4 tropical sites (Appendix S4; see also
Muller-Landau 2004; King et al. 2006; Chave et al. 2009).
HEIGHT AT MATURATION
Height at maturation describes the size around which an individual’s
allocation of net dry-matter production gradually switches from
growth to reproduction (eqn 16). (In eqn 16, it is the height at which
allocation to reproduction reaches 50% of its maximum value.)
Height at maturation thereby inﬂuences survival until maturation,
subsequent reproductive output, length of the reproductive lifespan,
and expected lifetime fecundity.
SEED SIZE
The effects of seed size were modelled through a trade-off between
fecundity and size at germination (eqn 1, 17). Large seed size was not
treated as conferring any advantage during the seed and establish-
ment phases of the life cycle, but did inﬂuence an individual’s size
when it entered a patch, implying an advantage during the subsequent
competitive interactions.
Outline of analyses
We analysed a series of single-species stands under a solar regime cor-
responding to Sydney, Australia, with a mean disturbance interval of
30 years. The model was calibrated using a variety of sources, includ-
ing large multi-site databases and detailed site-speciﬁc studies. An
overview of the parameters used is given in Table 2; for full details of
the parameterization see Appendix S7 in Supporting Information.
We used the escalator boxcar train technique (de Roos 1997), com-
bined with a fourth-order Runge–Kutta ordinary differential equa-
tion solver (Press 1995), to model the dynamics of the vegetation’s
size distribution (eqn 22).
To assess the inﬂuence of traits on vegetation, we varied individual
traits over a majority of their known empirical range. For each trait
combination, we modelled a metapopulation at demographic equilib-
rium (where a patch’s seed rain equals its seed production) and
recorded temporal patterns of stand development and of metapopu-
lation averages for each of the four vegetation properties (eqn 24–27).
Available data on height at maturation are limited; consequently, we
chose a range from 6 to 24 m, with an intermediate height of 12 m.
For the other three traits, we described the known empirical range
from available databases, adopting the median, ﬁfth, and ninety-ﬁfth
percentiles for average, low and high parameter settings. Data for
LMA were taken from the GLOPNET dataset (Wright et al. 2004)
restricted to trees and shrubs. Data for wood density were taken from
a global wood database (Zanne et al. 2009). Data for seed size were
taken from a published database (Moles et al. 2004), restricted to spe-
cies that attain more than 5 m height. Each trait was varied across its
known range, while the remaining three traits were kept at their glo-
bal mean values (Table 3).
To quantify any interaction between site productivity or distur-
bance regime on the one hand and trait-related effects on the other,
we repeated our analyses across a range of mean disturbance intervals
and site productivities.
Results
We ﬁrst outline some general features of the model observed
in a single-species stand with global mean trait values. The
purpose of this ﬁrst section is to highlight how a size-struc-
tured model naturally captures several known phenomena in
vegetation dynamics. We then describe the inﬂuence of the
four traits on emergent properties of vegetation. In a ﬁnal
section, we brieﬂy investigate how trait-related shifts in vegeta-
tion could interact with shifts in site productivity or distur-
bance regime.

General features of the model
COMPETITION FOR LIGHT LIMITS SEEDLING
RECRUITMENT, SAPLING SURVIVAL, LAI, AND DENSITY
OF SEED RAIN
Notwithstanding the continual inﬂux of seeds, the model pre-
dicts several waves of recruitment and a bimodal distribution
of plant sizes during stand development (see central panel of
Fig. 1). The ﬁrst wave of recruitment occurs immediately after
disturbance, when individuals establish in open conditions.
Individuals at the top of the size hierarchy increase quickly in
size and experience only limited mortality. The growth of taller
individuals decreases light available for individuals sitting
lower in the size hierarchy, reducing growth and increasing
mortality. Declining light ultimately limits seedling establish-
ment. Eventually, however, enough individuals from the
canopy die to allow light at ground level to rise again above the
minimum light requirement for seedlings. This initiates a
second wave of recruitment, again followed by competitive
thinning (Fig. 1). Competitive thinning operates such that
individuals of a given size are removed at an increased rate
while light levels are close or below their minimum light
requirement. Since seedlings have the lowest burden of stem
respiration per unit leaf area they are able to survive at lower
light levels. As a result, competitive thinning constrains the
LAI of whole stands to lie close to values corresponding to the
minimum light requirement of seedlings.
Traditionally, self-thinning has been investigated by plot-
ting average plant size (measured in leaf mass) against the
number of individuals per area. A corresponding plot from
our model is shown in Fig. 2. Following disturbance, the den-
sity of individuals and the LAI of the stand increase rapidly.
Leaf area continues to accumulate until production from indi-
viduals at the bottom of the size hierarchy is close to zero. This
is followed by a period of competitive thinning (from 1.4 to
13.8 years), during which average size increases and popula-
tion density decreases (Fig. 2). The slope of this self-thinning
trajectory is approximately )1.0, implying that the total mass
of leaves remains nearly constant (but not exactly, as high-
lighted below). A second wave of seedling recruitment then
moves the population back along the self-thinning trajectory
Table 3. Range of trait values used in simulations, and resulting vegetation properties. Low, average, and high values for LMA, wood density,
and seed size were determined by taking the ﬁfth, ﬁftieth, and ninety-ﬁfth percentiles from published trait datasets (see ‘Material and Methods’
for details), with N indicating the number of species in each dataset. The % change for each trait and vegetation property was calculated as
abs(high – low) ⁄ average*100.

towards smaller average size and larger density. The return
trajectory in Fig. 2 is slightly offset from the initial trajectory,
indicating that the actual density of leaf mass, and thus LAI,
is not entirely ﬁxed, instead varying slightly throughout stand
development. These results are explained in more detail
below.
Density-dependent growth within patches results in vegeta-
tion that is not seed-limited. The recruitment curve at land-
scape scale, i.e. integrated over all patch ages, shows that seed
production is almost constant with respect to changes in seed
rain (results not shown). This suggests that the emergent prop-
erties studied below will not differ substantially when mortality
during dispersal is varied or when the assumption that meta-
populations are demographically stable is relaxed.
AGE-RELATED DECLINES IN LAI AND NPP ARISE
THROUGH COMPETITION, BUT ARE OFFSET BY
SEEDLING RECRUITMENT
A plot of LAI against patch age shows how LAI ﬁrst increases
and then declines slightly before stabilizing (Fig. 3), with NPP
showing similar behaviour (results not shown). As outlined in
the previous section, equilibrium LAI is mostly determined by
the light requirement of seedlings, which accounts for its stabi-
lizing after the second wave of recruitment has been initiated.
However, among individuals from the ﬁrst wave of recruit-
ment, the model predicts an age-related decline in LAI and
NPP, as has been observed in numerous stands (see Ryan,
Binkley & Fownes 1997 and refs therein). The decline in LAI is
caused
by
size-structured
population
dynamics,
while
increased stem respiration also contributes to the decline in
NPP. To illustrate the mechanism of LAI decline, we have
plotted LAI separately for three subsets of individuals based
on the size distribution in older patches: (i) dominant individu-
als in the ﬁrst wave of recruitment, which eventually form the
canopy in older patches; (ii) subordinates in the ﬁrst wave of
recruitment, which eventually die because they are competi-
tively suppressed; and (iii) all individuals in the second wave of
recruitment (Fig. 3).
Among individuals in the ﬁrst wave of recruitment, the ini-
tial decline in LAI after canopy closure (from 3.5 to 14.5 years)
is due to mortality of competitively suppressed individuals
(Fig. 3). During the ﬁrst 5 years of stand development, the
individuals that later become canopy dominants represent only
a small fraction (in numbers and in leaf area) of all individuals
in the ﬁrst wave of recruitment (Fig. 3). However, these indi-
viduals have a small size advantage, which provides access to
higher light and thus a growth advantage. As these dominant
individuals increase in size, subordinate individuals become
increasingly shaded, which increases mortality. A time lag
occurs between the expansion of new leaves at the top of the
canopy and the removal of shaded individuals at the bottom of
the canopy. Consequently, LAI exceeds its sustainable value
throughout the entire period during which canopy dominants
continue to increase in size. This rise in LAI also explains the
lack of seedling recruitment between 1.86 and 11.4 years.
A second phase of LAI decline (starting at 19.1 years)
results from intrinsic mortality of canopy dominants after they
have matured (Fig. 3). The competitive interactions leading to
high mortality of subordinate individuals earlier during stand
development means that there are few individuals available to
replace the lost dominants, so the cumulative LAI of all indi-
viduals from the ﬁrst wave of recruitment decreases. In our
model, this second period of decline is compensated for by
seedling recruitment, so the decline in LAI does not proceed
beyond approximately 15 years. However, if data were
reported only for large individuals (as would often be the case
in forest surveys), or if recruitment were limited to periods
immediately after disturbance, then a prolonged period of
decline would be observed.
Inﬂuences of traits on vegetation
Figure 4 shows changes in the four vegetation properties dur-
ing stand development following disturbance for low, average,
and high settings of each trait, representing, respectively, the
5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of empirically observed values.
These temporal patterns were integrated over the patch-age
distribution, to obtain a metapopulation average for each of
the vegetation properties. Responses of these metapopulation
averages to trait variation are summarized in Table 3. These
responses are referred to as being small (<10%), moderate
(10–30%) or large (>30%), according to the magnitude of
change observed across the trait spectrum (see Table 3 for
details). Fig. 5 gives a graphical depiction of the results for
two of the four vegetation properties considered, under a
range of disturbance regimes and productivities. Plots for the
remaining vegetation properties, together with equilibrium
seed rain, are included in Figs S7 and S8 in Supporting Infor-
mation.

RACE TO THE TOP: LEAF ECONOMICS, WOOD DENSITY,
AND SEED SIZE ALL INFLUENCE HEIGHT GROWTH
Leaf economics, wood density, and seed size all inﬂuenced tem-
poral patterns of height growth, while height at maturation
had an effect on the eventual height of the canopy (Fig. 4). The
inﬂuence of seed size on height growth was most intuitive: lar-
ger seeds resulted in larger seedlings, with this size advantage
being maintained until maturation. The inﬂuence of wood den-
sity on growth was also intuitive: lower wood density meant
more economical stem construction, which in turn enables
faster height growth. Note that wood density did not inﬂuence
instantaneous dry-matter production in the model, but only
the deployment of dry matter. Similarly, lower LMA conferred
more economical leaf-area construction and thereby a faster
height growth rate, at least for smaller individuals. Since allo-
cation to stem increased with size, the relative height advantage
of low-wood-density strategies increased until maturation
(Fig. 4). In contrast, the initial growth advantages of low
LMA diminished over time, to the extent that high-LMA
stands actually reached maturation size ﬁrst, even though low
LMA stands were initially the fastest growing (Fig. 4). This
occurred because of an interaction between size and maximum
growth rate. At small sizes, low LMA strategies have an
advantage, because the beneﬁts of cheaper leaf construction
outweigh the costs of increased leaf turnover. At larger sizes,
the opposite is true.
LAI IS INFLUENCED MORE BY MINIMUM LIGHT
REQUIREMENT THAN BY INTRINSIC MORTALITY OR
SEED RAIN
Leaf economics and height at maturation had a moderate
inﬂuence on LAI, while wood density and seed size had only
a small inﬂuence (Fig. 5; Table 3). The inﬂuence of leaf
economics came about by altering the minimum light
requirement of seedlings. Fast-growth strategies imply costs
of increased leaf turnover and higher respiration rates per
mass. The slope in the double logarithmic relationship
between turnover rate and LMA was parameterized at )1.71

(see Appendix S7). A slope less than –1 means that decreases
in the cost of deploying leaves (lower LMA) are associated
with disproportionately larger increases in leaf turnover,
leading to a greater light requirement for fast-growth strate-
gies. The high light requirement of fast-growth strategies lim-
ited the sustainable LAI.
The inﬂuences of height at maturation, wood density and
seed size were less intuitive. Height at maturation and seed size
both inﬂuenced the density of seed rain (Table 3): height at
maturation by diverting energy away from seed production,
and seed size by altering the partitioning of mass among off-
spring. Higher equilibrium seed rain increased rates of seedling
germination, and even though most of the additional seedlings
were thinned out through competitive interactions, there was a
small to moderate increase in LAI (Fig. 5). Wood density also
had a small effect on LAI because of inﬂuences on seedling
mortality (Fig. 5).
HEIGHT AT MATURATION INFLUENCES NPP BY
CHANGING THE TOTAL RESPIRATORY LOAD OF
VEGETATION
Changes in NPP resulted from changes either in gross primary
productivity (GPP), driven by total LAI, or in total respira-
tion. Despite the inﬂuence of leaf economics on LAI (and
therefore on GPP), leaf strategy caused no shift in NPP,
because changes in GPP were compensated by changes in total
stem and leaf respiration. The small changes in LAI driven by
wood density and seed size translated into even smaller effects
on NPP. However, the model assumed stem respiration was
proportional to stem volume, and therefore, wood density
affected NPP solely via mortality. It remains unclear if rates of
stem respiration per volume vary with wood density, but if this
were the case, some additional effect of wood density on NPP
could be expected. Height at maturation, on the other hand,

had a moderate effect on NPP, because taller stems had
increased volumes of live sapwood and bark per individual.
TRAIT VARIATION OFFERS THREE ALTERNATIVE
PATHWAYS TO INCREASED STANDING BIOMASS
Leaf economics, wood density, and height at maturation all led
to large changes in biomass density (Fig. 5; Table 3), each real-
ized through a different demographic pathway. Along the ﬁrst
pathway, leaf economic strategy altered leaf area and basal
area. Increased LMA decreases the light requirement of indi-
viduals, causing an increase in population density, which in
turn increases LAI and thus total sapwood volume. Additional
wood mass accounted for most of the biomass change, but
there was also a large (268%) change in total leaf mass associ-
ated with shifts in LMA. Along the second pathway, wood
density shifted the allocation of mass between leaf and stem.
Since wood density had only limited inﬂuence on LAI, similar
total volumes of sapwood were maintained in stands having
low and high wood density. Stands with higher wood density
therefore supported a greater standing mass of wood. Along
the third pathway, height at maturation extended the growth
period. By deferring the shift from vegetative to reproductive
allocation, individuals accumulate more mass as wood.
LIMITED INFLUENCE OF SEED SIZE ON VEGETATION
PROPERTIES
Changes in seed size had only small effects on LAI, NPP, and
biomass density (Table 3), primarily because vegetation was
not seed-limited. However, there were some noticeable effects
of seed size on patterns of development in young stands
(Fig. 4), and on average values for each of the vegetation prop-
erties in the metapopulation (Fig. 5). The inﬂuence of seed size
on young stands had two parts. First, smaller seed size resulted
in higher seed rain, which translated into faster increases in
LAI and NPP after disturbance. LAI peaked earlier in stands
with smaller seeds, and there was also a greater difference
between peak and equilibrium LAI (Fig. 4). Second, larger
seed size resulted in a height and biomass advantage that was
maintained until reproduction. Because younger stands make
up more than half the metapopulation, these transient effects
of seed size, although small, did lead to changes in emergent
vegetation properties of up to 15% (Table 3).
Inﬂuences of disturbance regime and site
productivity on vegetation
Results presented above apply to stands growing under similar
abiotic conditions. Here we investigate the sensitivity of these
patterns to changes in site productivity and disturbance
regime. While vegetation properties responded strongly to
changes in productivity and disturbance, the inﬂuence of traits
on vegetation dynamics was similar across the different stands
(Fig. 5).
The strongest inﬂuence of disturbance interval was on aver-
age height and biomass; in contrast, LAI and NPP were almost
constant for disturbance intervals longer than 15 years
(Fig. 5a, S7). Height and biomass increased more slowly in
developing stands than do NPP or LAI (Fig. 4). Shorter
disturbance intervals decreased the fraction of the metapopu-
lation at older stand ages; therefore, landscape-wide biomass
density and height were lower. At disturbance intervals of
15 years or less, LAI decreased strongly with height at matura-
tion, because deferring seed production to large sizes for short
disturbance intervals generated chronically low reproductive
output. Realistically, species requiring large height at matura-
tion would not persist under these conditions.
All four vegetation properties increased under more produc-
tive site conditions, as might be expected (Fig. 5b, S8). The
response of NPP to changes in site productivity was larger than
to trait variation, while for height, LAI, and biomass, the
responses were similar in magnitude (Fig. S8).
Discussion
A primary challenge in modelling emergent properties of vege-
tation is to scale efﬁciently and transparently from tissue-level,
to individual-, population-, and landscape-level phenomena
(Prentice & Leemans 1990; Pacala et al. 1996; Levin et al.
1997; Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001). Ecological and life-
history traits of individuals must have their inﬂuence on emer-
gent properties of vegetation via allocations among different
tissue types and via the distributions of ages and sizes. That is
why the challenge must be approached with a model that
incorporates the entire life cycle of individuals, including the
inﬂuences of traits, climate, competition, and disturbance on
demography and size structure. TSPMs (trait-, size- and patch-
structured models) offer a viable compromise between the
detailed but noisy output of spatially explicit simulation mod-
els and the convenience of modelling idealized stands lacking
internal population structure. The TSPM described here was
used to investigate the inﬂuences of four functional traits, for
which trade-offs are relatively well understood, on several key
properties of vegetation. The approach could be extended
to other traits, once the trade-offs governing their effects are
sufﬁciently described.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC LINK BETWEEN TRAITS AND
EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF VEGETATION
Leaf economic strategy had a moderate effect on LAI and a
large effect on biomass density through a chain of inﬂuence
that is well supported by empirical evidence. In the model, leaf
strategy inﬂuenced LAI by altering plant light requirement
(Givnish 1988; Baltzer & Thomas 2007). The relationship
between LMA and turnover has a slope of less than )1 (Wright
et al. 2004), meaning that fast growth strategies suffer from dis-
proportionately fast leaf turnover. Low-LMA strategies also
imply higher respiration per unit leaf mass, because of higher
nitrogen content per mass (Wright et al. 2004). High turnover
and respiration increases the light requirement for individuals
of a given size, which ultimately causes a decrease in LAI.

strategy, Reich, Walters & Ellsworth (1992) found a decrease
in LAI and stand biomass, but no change in NPP, with shifts
towards faster leaf strategy (lower LMA), which is consistent
with our results. Beyond that, data from species-rich tropical
forests support the inﬂuence of leaf economic strategy on mini-
mum light requirement and on survival in low light (Condit,
Hubbell & Foster 1996; Poorter & Bongers 2006; Baltzer &
Thomas 2007). Multi-species datasets also support the notion
of faster initial height growth rates for low LMA strategies
(Reich, Walters & Ellsworth 1992; Poorter & Bongers 2006).
The effect of leaf economic strategy on biomass density
resulted from increasing the density of plants in the vegetation,
whereas higher wood density and height at maturation
increased the mass per individual. These effects are consistent
with such stand-level data as are available. Baker et al. (2004)
estimated that up to 40% of regional variation in above-
ground mass for Amazonian tropical forests might be attrib-
uted to differences in wood density. Keith, Mackey & Linden-
mayer (2009) found that the world’s tallest forests also contain
the greatest mass of carbon. Furthermore, our model indicates
that trait variation may increase biomass density without
increasing NPP. In fact, NPP decreased slightly in taller stands
because of additional stem respiration. Wood density had a
negligible inﬂuence on NPP, in line with theoretical expecta-
tions (Enquist et al. 1999), but this result hinges on our
assumption of constant stem respiration per volume. If rates of
stem respiration per volume were found to increase with wood
density, then NPP would decrease. So what are plants sacriﬁc-
ing to achieve this additional expenditure on stem tissues in
high wood density and tall stands? In the case of height at mat-
uration, additional stem mass came at the expense of reproduc-
tive output. In the case of wood density, high-density stands
have less intrinsic mortality, decreasing the rate at which accu-
mulated carbon is recycled into the litter pool.
Biomass density was the vegetation property we found to
be most sensitive to trait variation and changes in disturbance
frequency. Other studies have likewise reported a large inﬂu-
ence of disturbance regime on standing biomass. For example,
Hurtt et al. (2002) used a PDE-based model to estimate histor-
ical patterns of carbon ﬂux resulting from land-use change in
North America. They estimated that early land-use changes,
mainly clearing for agriculture, caused a net efﬂux of carbon
from terrestrial ecosystems, while ﬁre suppression and agricul-
tural abandonment since 1900 have resulted in a net uptake of
carbon throughout the 20th century. The advantage of using a
TSPM to estimate landscape-scale changes in biomass is that
rates of change are directly constrained by current patch struc-
ture and size structure. In this context, it is interesting to note
that most DGVMs, as well as land-surface models coupled
with global climate models, do not explicitly consider patch
structure or size structure (Cramer et al. 2001; Bonan & Levis
2002; Sitch et al. 2008). While these models may prove accu-
rate in predicting NPP, which we found to be relatively insensi-
tive to traits and disturbance regime, their predictions about
biomass density may be less informative than those coming
from a TSPM in which patch age and stand structure are
explicitly modelled.
Combined, our results underscore the need for vegetation
models to incorporate functional traits together with their
effects on the patch structure and size structure of vegetation.
Our study has shown that the effects of some traits on vegeta-
tion properties may be as strong as the inﬂuence of site produc-
tivity and disturbance, although it should be noted that these
predictions have been derived for single-species stands only.
The ecological dynamics that give rise to these effects also illus-
trate why size structure within populations is important. Size
structure was present in the stochastic gap models widely used
during the past three decades (for reviews, see Shugart 1984;
Bugmann 2001). However, stochastic simulators inhibit
detailed investigations of ecological feedbacks such as those
presented here, and are not practical for incorporation into
large-scale applications like DGVMs. For these reasons,
researchers have sought ways to approximate the collective
dynamics of heterogeneous populations (Sinko & Streifer
1967; Levin & Paine 1974; Levin et al. 1997; de Roos 1997),
leading to the development of PDE-based models (Kohyama
1993; Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001; Strigul et al. 2008;
Medvigy et al. 2009). Since PDE-based models can account
for patch and size structure, while enabling deterministic
numerical solutions, they have been advocated as a possible
foundation for next-generation DGVMs (Purves & Pacala
2008).
IMPLICATIONS FOR MULTI-SPECIES STANDS
For the most part, we expect the results presented here to
extend to multi-species stands. Patch- and size-structured
models, formulated either as stochastic gap-models or as
their deterministic approximations, can easily accommodate
multiple species, provided there is an opportunity for the dif-
ferent types to coexist (Shugart 1984; Kohyama 1993). These
models are thus well suited for investigating questions about
community assembly and the effects of species diversity on
ecosystem function. Based on the results presented here, we
predict that the LAI of multi-species stands will be deter-
mined mainly by the species with highest LMA, since leaf
area will continue to accumulate while light levels remain
above that species’ light requirement. To the extent they are
inﬂuenced by LAI, NPP and biomass density may exhibit
similar patterns. However, these vegetation properties are
also inﬂuenced by wood density and height at maturation,
whose inﬂuence on multi-species stands will be determined
by the precise mixture of trait values rather than by the most
extreme trait value. Shifts in the average trait value are
bound to produce a corresponding shift in emergent proper-
ties. Quantifying these effects in the ﬁeld may be complicated
by the known covariation of traits with climate and other
site factors: leaf economic strategy and wood density move
towards faster growth, and height and seed mass increase, as
abiotic conditions become more favourable for growth
(Wright et al. 2004; Moles et al. 2005, 2009; Chave et al.
2009). This suggests a key role for TSPMs in assessing how
climate and traits combine to give rise to variation in vegeta-
tion properties across landscapes.

FURTHER REFINING THE REPRESENTATION OF
VEGETATION IN TSPMS
The representation of vegetation in current TSPMs is an
improvement over most DGVMs, which lack internal popula-
tion and patch structure (see also Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala
2001; Hurtt et al. 2002; Medvigy et al. 2009). Nevertheless, this
representation remains a simpliﬁed version of real communi-
ties. It is therefore worth noting some outstanding challenges
for the TSPM approach.
Probably the most signiﬁcant challenge is to determine
whether a single state dimension adequately describes the
ontogenetic pathway traversed by individuals within a species
as they mature. With a single state dimension, the various size
metrics that describe individuals within a species, such as
crown leaf area, height, stem basal area, or root mass have to
be bound together, so that all size metrics can be predicted
from a single variable. This means that allocation, for exam-
ple to roots versus leaves, cannot change dynamically in
response to environmental conditions, except by varying the
traits of the entire species (i.e. by redeﬁning the ontogenetic
pathway). In principle, more state dimensions can be included
(e.g. Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001), but this makes the
model harder to solve. In contrast, most DGVMs maintain
numerous state dimensions, but to make this possible, they
sacriﬁce all detail regarding size structure within each species,
so that the entire metapopulation of a species is represented in
terms of a single average-sized individual, with recruits also
entering at this size (Cramer et al. 2001; Bonan & Levis
2002; Woodward & Lomas 2004; Sitch et al. 2008). While it
will be worthwhile to attempt implementing extensions of the
TSPM approach presented here to multiple state dimensions,
so far stochastic simulations are offering the only practical
way to combine multiple state dimensions with detailed size
structure.
The assumption that disturbances are stand-replacing may
also be cause for concern. This assumption makes it easier to
scale up from a single patch to the entire metapopulation. But
in many cases, disturbances remove only part of a patch’s vege-
tation, resulting in a complex age structure within each patch
(Pickett & White 1985). To properly incorporate these dynam-
ics would be computationally challenging, since each patch in
the metapopulation would need to be simulated explicitly. The
question thus remains how much this reﬁnement would inﬂu-
ence our results. However, there are vegetation types for which
the stand-replacement assumption applies (Pickett & White
1985; Clark 1989; Coomes & Allen 2007), making it a reason-
able ﬁrst approximation of disturbance-driven vegetation
dynamics.
An even broader challenge is to determine how well the
PDEs used in TSPMs approximate competitive and distur-
bance-driven vegetation dynamics. The PDE governing stand
development used here has been derived both as the determin-
istic limit for increasingly large patches (Kohyama 1993; de
Roos 1997), and as the average of many runs of a stochastic
gap model containing few individuals per patch (Moorcroft,
Hurtt & Pacala 2001). This suggests that the PDE may suit a
variety of disturbance types, although both derivations assume
spatial homogeneity within patches. Including spatial interac-
tions within patches could, in principle, alter patterns of stand
development, although the effect on the emergent properties
considered here might be minimal (Busing & Mailly 2004). For
example, Strigul et al. (2008) showed that when phototropic
effects were included in spatial simulations of stand develop-
ment, basal area and tree density were well approximated by
the standard PDE used here, which ignores within-patch spa-
tial effects (see also Hurtt et al. 1998). Likewise, accounting for
the distribution of patch ages across a landscape may be sufﬁ-
cient for estimating emergent properties of metapopulations,
without considering the spatial arrangement of patches. More
generally, the approach of modelling a dynamic landscape, in
which individual patches constantly change, within an equilib-
rium framework seems promising for reconciling ‘equilibrium’
and ‘non-equilibrium’ approaches to modelling ecological
dynamics (Levin & Paine 1974; Connell 1978; Bormann &
Likens 1979).
A NECESSARY BUT DIFFICULT CHALLENGE:
CONFIRMING MODEL PREDICTIONS
As vegetation models become more complex they may account
for an increasing array of observable phenomena. However,
our ability to conﬁrm the behaviour of sophisticated models
has been limited by the availability of suitable data. For exam-
ple, we found only a single data set relating trait values to
emergent properties of vegetation in single-species forest
stands (Reich, Walters & Ellsworth 1992). Other data sets exist
for traits, for ecosystem properties, and for stand structure,
but these are almost always disconnected from one another,
which is far from ideal. There is also a shortage of adequate
data with which to parameterize and test the various sub-mod-
els in TSPMs. To parameterize our model we have drawn on
some of the best data sources available, but still they are not
ideal, and also they come from a mixture of situations.
Consider the Coweeta dataset (Martin et al. 1998) used to
parameterize our allocation model. It provides unusually good
within-species resolution, but even so, the dataset is limited to
relatively large trees so our estimates of sapling allometry
are rough approximations at best. It is also unclear how repre-
sentative these allometries are of other vegetation types. The
general problem is that researchers have thus far relied on a
disparate range of data sources of varying quality for model
parameterization and conﬁrmation, as have we.
We are optimistic about future opportunities for fruitful
model-data comparisons. Long-term records of size-structured
growth dynamics are accumulating for a variety of sites, and in
some cases, are being supplemented with species trait data (e.g.
Wright et al. 2010). Such data will offer unparalleled opportu-
nities to evaluate the performance of TSPMs (Purves & Pacala
2008; Medvigy et al. 2009). Importantly, detailed datasets
allow TSPMs to be evaluated based on their ability to predict
multiple phenomena, whereas previous research has focussed
on individual phenomena in isolation. Combined with detailed
records from ecosystem ﬂux towers, long-term plot data also

offer a pathway for reﬁning weakly constrained model param-
eters (Medvigy et al. 2009). There also exist many experimental
plantings worldwide established by forestry services, offering a
rich source of potential data if it can be accessed. Overall, cer-
tainty in model predictions would be improved through colla-
tion and assimilation of standardized datasets from a variety
of species and systems.
Conclusions
To investigate the impact of leaf economic strategy, wood den-
sity, seed size, and height at maturation on emergent properties
of vegetation, we used a model capturing the entire life cycle of
individuals, from germination to sapling growth and matura-
tion, because the advantages of these traits are manifested
through inﬂuences on size distribution and demography. In
the past, individual-based models have often relied on empiri-
cally motivated growth equations (e.g. Shugart 1984; Pacala
et al. 1996; Bugmann 2001). However, growth is an outcome
of traits operating in a given environment, and the model pre-
sented here captures physiological processes and generates
many aspects of individual performance, stand dynamics, and
properties of vegetation from trait variation (see also Friend
et al. 1997; Moorcroft, Hurtt & Pacala 2001). Trait-based
models are also easier to calibrate for new sites and species
mixtures. It is therefore hoped that the framework we have
presented here may open up new avenues for understanding
the role of traits in structuring vegetation through physiologi-
cal, ecological, and evolutionary processes.

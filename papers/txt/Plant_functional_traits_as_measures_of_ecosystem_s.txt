Abstract
Despite the relevance of ecosystem services (ES) to society and modern ecological
research, current methods of measurement and mapping remain inconsistent
and often lack primary data in estimating and modeling ES. A key player in
our understanding of ES and their measurements are plant functional traits—
chemical and physical aspects of plants—which are often cited as one of the
drivers of ecosystem processes and functions. In order to better quantify the
ES–plant functional trait indicators, we outline existing evidence of this rela-
tionship and identify gaps between the best predicted ES and the most valued
ES. This study offers an up-to-date review of plant functional traits’ direct or
indirect relationships with ecosystem service provision and discusses the quan-
titative evidence these traits might hold as indicators. With this review, we
seek to (1) offer a current summary of the quantitative evidence on ecosystem
service–plant functional trait relationships, (2) identify which traits have been
used to successfully indicate ecosystem services, and (3) identify research gaps,
and ecosystem services or traits that receive little attention or have weak
criteria as indicators. In a comprehensive literature review of the 19 services
that were searched for, genetic materials, medicine, and cultural services had
no relevant plant functional trait indicators, while the remaining 16 services
had a range of traits associated with them. We found that functional traits
showed varying relationships to ES, with some depending on the ecosystem
type they were found in, while others appeared to remain consistent across
ecosystems and conditions. This indicates that there could exist a subset of
traits that are “universal” indicators across all ecosystem types, while others
are ecosystem dependent. Our review suggests the need for more research on
less clearly defined ES (such as cultural, educational, and refugium services)
both by more careful definitions to make quantitative measures more applica-
ble, and through increased quantitative and qualitative studies to better under-
stand the nature of ES indicators for these services. This summary shows how
plant functional traits can quantitatively and reliably predict and provide
details on a subset of ES.

INTRODUCTION
Ecosystem processes depend on the species and func-
tional composition of an ecosystem, particularly the plant
community (Hooper et al., 2005; Lavorel et al., 2007;
Lavorel & Garnier, 2002; Suding et al., 2008). Plant spe-
cies richness and abundances are often used to assess
ecosystem health, restoration, external influences (both
positive and negative), and other important aspects of
ecosystem processes and functions. More recently, the
use of plant functional traits—the characteristics of
plants that determine responses to and effects on the sur-
rounding environment, other species, and trophic levels
(Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016)—has become an effi-
cient and accurate way to investigate the effects of large-
scale land and climate change (Dı́az & Cabido, 2001;
Suding et al., 2008) as well as various disturbance effects
(Hooper et al., 2005; Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016). In
fact, since they offer both a mechanistic explanation and
accurate estimate of multiple ecosystem processes and
functions, the use of plant functional traits to explain eco-
system processes has been deemed the “Holy Grail” in
ecology (Funk et al., 2017; Lavorel et al., 2007). These
functional traits provide accurate measures of many eco-
system processes and responses, directly scaling up from
plants (which are often considered the foundation of an
ecosystem) to ecosystem-level functions (Kremen, 2005;
Suding et al., 2008) since changes in plant traits have a
direct and often determinative effect on the ecosystem
functions
which
drive
ecosystem
processes
(Suding
et al., 2008). This is particularly relevant, as ecosystem
services (ES)—the aspects of ecosystems that directly or
indirectly benefit humanity—have also been both theo-
retically and quantitatively linked to these functional
trait responses and measures (see Figure 1; Bardgett
et al., 2014; de Bello et al., 2010). These ES can be any-
thing from food and raw materials, benefits of biodiver-
sity, clean air and water, to the regulation of whole
systems of water flow, nutrient cycling, and climate regu-
lation (Fisher & Turner, 2008). Given the relevance of
ES to society and recent importance in the inter-
section of conservation and applied ecology, it is essen-
tial
to
have
consistent
and
accurate
methods
of
measurement (Carpenter et al., 2009), particularly with
the growing threat of climate change and global land-use
change (Imbert et al., 2021; IPBES, 2019; Schlickmann
et al., 2020).
Many frameworks for measuring the demand and
flow of ES focus on social variables that influence ES pro-
vision (Olander et al., 2018; Quintas-Soriano et al., 2018;
Spangenberg et al., 2014) investigate trade-offs between
ES and conservation (Chianucci et al., 2018; Lang &
Song, 2018; Moein et al., 2018), or categorize the world’s
ES potential on global, national, and municipal levels
(Ala-Hulkko et al., 2019; Milheiras & Mace, 2019). Unfor-
tunately, these methods of measurement and mapping
remain inconsistent between studies, often relying on
indirect
indicators
such
as
land
cover
(Burkhard
et al., 2009) which overlooks significant beta diversity
changes and other heterogeneity across a single habitat.
Since landscape averages and ecosystem type estimates
depend on generic characteristics of an ecosystem to pre-
dict provision, rather than recognizing and investigating
the dynamics of the ecological or biotic mechanisms of
service delivery, these measures do not account for the
complexities and influence of multiple environmental
and human drivers (Suding et al., 2008). Additionally, the
social measures that are a frequent alternative (Sherrouse
et al., 2011) are highly subjective (Malherbe et al., 2019;
Martínez-Harms & Balvanera, 2012; Olander et al., 2018;
Paudyal et al., 2019). These inconsistent and subjective
measures remain the norm, despite several calls to
develop a standard indicator (Boyd & Banzhaf, 2007;
Kremen, 2005; Layke et al., 2012) and to include more
primary data in service measures (Eigenbrod et al., 2010;
Lavorel, 2013). Using plant functional traits as a standard
indicator of ES delivery can reference the mechanism or
a deeper understanding of ecological principles which
allows for management of ES and prediction of future
service availability. With the growing consensus that it is
composition and functional effects of individual species,
rather than species diversity or richness, that better pre-
dicts ecosystem processes (and thus ES), plant functional
traits are one option to provide an accurate and holistic
explanation of ecosystem services (Chapin III, 2003;
Dı́az & Cabido, 2001; Manzoor et al., 2019; Shipley
et al., 2006).
The idea of functional traits providing measures of
ecosystem
services
is
not
new.
In
fact,
de
Bello
et al. (2010), completed a general review outlining the
relationships between plant functional traits and ecosys-
tem services, justifying the increasing attention that these
traits were receiving as a key factor in how biotic forces
influence the ecosystems around them, including ES. In

MIEDEMA BROWN AND ANAND

this paper, they listed 247 studies of trait–service relation-
ships between plants and invertebrates, discussed many
theoretical mechanisms of how traits lead to ES, and pro-
vided a basis for the applicability of these traits to mea-
sure and explain ES and trait–service clusters for ES
prediction. In the 10 years since its publication, many
new papers have continued the investigation of the links
between ES and plant functional traits. To better under-
stand the potential that functional traits hold for accu-
rately measuring service delivery, we offer a current
review of the literature from 2010 to 2021, investigating
the use of plant functional traits as indicators for ES. We
outline what plant functional traits specifically have been
used to identify relationships with ES provision and dis-
cuss the theoretical and quantitative evidence these traits
might hold as indicators. ES are increasingly relevant for
both researchers and policymakers alike, and knowledge
of functional traits as measures of ES could be incorpo-
rated into estimates of natural resources and capital for
municipalities (Lam & Conway, 2018; Sang et al., 2021),
conservation and restoration (do Vale et al., 2010; Zirbel
et al., 2017), and measures of changes in ecosystems due
to climate change and urban expansion (Song et al., 2019).
The objectives of this paper are to (a) offer a current
review of the literature on ecosystem service–plant func-
tional trait relationships, (b) identify which traits have
been used to successfully indicate ecosystem services, and
which
traits
have
strong
theoretical
evidence,
and
(c) identify research gaps, and ecosystem services or traits
that receive little attention or have weak criteria as

The relationship between plant functional traits (shown in the circle), ecosystem functions and processes (shown with
double sided arrows), and ecosystem services (with movements shown with a single arrow). (a) Plant functional traits can both determine
ecosystem processes (through community averages shaping the way the ecosystem function or be shaped by them (the influence of
ecosystem determining how individual plants or communities respond, or filtering which traits are able to survive). Traits of the plant
community, as the producers of an ecosystem, form the basis for (b) ecosystem processes or ecosystem functions, which are the flows of
nutrients or processes in an ecosystem (e.g., water filtration or carbon sequestration) that occur on an ecosystem-wide scale and keep the
ecosystem functioning as whole. Ecosystem processes include how plant communities interact with abiotic factors of the environment such
as soil–root interactions. These processes can be complex or simple and although they occur at a large scale, they encompass the traits and
characteristics of entire communities across the ecosystem. They occur, whether or not humans are present or benefit unlike (c) ecosystem
services, which refers to ecosystem processes that have a direct or indirect benefit to human society or individuals. Ecosystem services refer
only to the benefits that society derives from these naturally occurring processes and is thus necessarily anthropocentric in nature

indicators. In this way, we seek to further the understand-
ing of current trait–service research to provide an updated
and thorough summary of the research as well as outline
which traits have the potential to act as robust indicators
of ecosystem service.
METHODS
For this review, we followed the guidelines for systematic
review outlined by Pullin and Stewart (2006) to search
for papers investigating the relationship between plant
functional traits and ecosystem services. A Boolean sea-
rch was performed in Google Scholar, including the key-
words
of
plant
functional
traits
and
the
titles
of
19 different ES (as outlined by de Groot et al. (2002) and
cross-referenced with IPBES, 2019 Science’s more mod-
ern interpretation of these classic categories) (see Appen-
dix S1 for full search terms for each service–trait
relationship). The
19
ecosystem
services
that
were
searched for were as follows: gas regulation, climate regu-
lation, disturbance prevention, water regulation, water
supply, soil retention, soil formation, nutrient regulation,
waste treatment, pollination, biological controls, refu-
gium, nursery, food, biodiversity, medicinal, raw mate-
rials, genetic resources, and ornamental resources. All
results were amalgamated, and duplicates were removed
resulting in a total of 1427 papers from all searches. The
papers were then refined—the abstract and text were
skimmed, and only quantitative studies that measured a
relationship between one of the ecosystem services listed
and at least one plant functional trait were kept, elimi-
nating papers that did not measure specific functional
traits or functional diversity. We also eliminated any
meta-analysis
or
literature
reviews,
books,
reports,
summaries, as the focus was on discovering published
quantitative studies that had investigated trait–service
relationship. Finally, papers that investigated functional
trait or plant community assembly through management,
land-use type, land-use change, or ecosystem type, rather
than direct or indirect links between functional traits and
ecosystem services were removed. This resulted in a total
of 127 papers.
RESULTS
We found a total of 127 relevant studies with primary
results showing relationships between plant functional
traits and ES or service-related functions (see Appendix S2
for full details). For these papers, there were 84 individual
plant functional traits cited as having associations with eco-
system services (see Table 1 and Appendix S2). Specific leaf
area (SLA) was the functional trait that was cited most
often, being referred to in 45 papers, and with 18 different
ES relationships (Appendix S2) and relating to 11 different
ES categories—biodiversity, climate regulation, disturbance
prevention, erosion prevention, food/fodder, gas regulation,
nutrient cycling, raw materials, refugia, soil fertility, and
water provision. SLA was also cited as being related to sev-
eral subservices. For example, SLA was associated with N
content, litter decomposition, and soil carbon all of which
are often used as indices of soil fertility (Daou &
Shipley, 2019; Partey et al., 2017; Yageta et al., 2019). Plant
height was the second most frequent functional trait, along
with functional diversity (the diversity of several different
traits, dependent on the paper) identified in 29 papers.
Plant height was found to be relating to seven different
ES—climate regulation, disturbance prevention, pollina-
tion, raw materials, soil fertility, and water provision, while
functional diversity was related to nine services: climate
regulation, disturbance prevention, erosion prevention, gas
regulation, multifunctionality, nutrient cycling, pollination,
raw materials, and soil fertility (Appendix S2). Functional
diversity was tied with plant height for reference used in
29 papers. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf nitro-
gen content (leaf N) were fourth and fifth with 25 and
24 citations, respectively, followed by leaf area (with 18 cita-
tions)—the other leaf nutrient contents, such as phospho-
rus (7) and carbon (7) cited much less frequently (see
Table 1 for full list of citations and traits).
Of the 19 services that were searched for, two of them
came up with no relevant plant functional trait indicators
in our literature review: genetic materials and nursery
services. The remaining 16 had a range of traits associ-
ated with them, from medicinal resources—which found
only two functional traits related—to soil fertility—which
had 65 citations (some trait associations were repeated
across studies) (see Table 2 and Appendix S2). The sec-
ond most commonly cited ES (after soil fertility) was cli-
mate regulation (cited 63 times), followed by disturbance
prevention (56 times), water provision (52 times), raw
materials (45 times), and erosion prevention (35 times)
(see Table 2 and Appendix S2). Traits were frequently
associated with more than one ES and those that were
related to multiple services could even be related to dif-
ferent aspects of ecosystem functioning (e.g., both soil
and water, or both raw materials and atmospheric regula-
tion, as opposed to soil retention and soil fertility, both of
which refer to aspects of the soil). Additionally, there are
several service–trait relationships that were repeated in
the literature, the most frequent of which was the posi-
tive association between plant height and raw materials
(seven occurrences) closely followed by the negative asso-
ciation between SLA measures and disturbance preven-
tion (seven occurrences) (see Appendix S2 for all details).

DISCUSSION
Plant functional traits offer some of the clearest potential
to measure ES and provide a scientifically defensible and
comparable quantification method, with both inter- and
intra-specific traits being strong indicators of environmental
conditions and change (Cadotte, 2017; Pérez-Harguindeguy
et al., 2016). As the ecological community continues to
scale up the implications of plant functional traits to
larger ecosystem-level processes and effects (Suding
et al., 2008), we must not overlook the potential to use
these traits to measure the changes in ES provision
(Chapin
III,
2003;
Hooper
et
al.,
2005;
Shipley
et al., 2006). Our review reveals 127 research articles with
statistical evidence of the potential of functional traits as
indicators or co-indicators of ES. This is fewer papers
than de Bello’s 247 papers, a fact most likely due to de
Bello et al.’s search for multiple trophic levels (including
the functional traits of birds, invertebrates, microbes, and
vertebrates as well as vegetation), and inclusion of theo-
retical relationships, while our review focused only on
quantitative evidence. In keeping with de Bello et al., the
majority of our searches found functional indicators for
ES which had clear definitions (e.g., food/fodder, water
regulation) compared to more loosely defined services
often directly tied to human use (e.g., cultural and medic-
inal services). The only two services that seemed to differ
in frequency between our results and those of de Bello

were disturbance prevention and soil retention (first and
sixth most commonly studied services, respectively, and
which were not clearly outlined in de Bello et al.’s paper).
This is likely due to the increase in the rampancy of inva-
sive species and the recent push from ecologists and stake-
holders alike for preventing invasive species takeover both
natural areas and urban sites (Lishawa et al., 2019; Mollot
et al., 2017). This could also relate to the increase in distur-
bance phenomena (i.e., flooding, forest fires, runoff, etc.)
in the past decade and an effort to use knowledge of eco-
logical
processes
to
mitigate
their
negative
effects
(Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016; Arnell & Gosling, 2016).
The shift in frequency of specific trait–service rela-
tionships could indicate an evolution of research in ES
and is likely connected to whatever services are currently
at most risk or have the greatest potential to mitigate neg-
ative natural phenomena. (Droste et al., 2018). For exam-
ple, there were a high number of studies investigating
disturbance prevention and erosion prevention, two ser-
vices the benefits of which are increasingly noticed and
valued in both agricultural and development sectors. Ero-
sion prevention not only saves topsoil but can save both
money and resources (Alam, 2018) in both industrial and
small-scale farming operations—important benefits given
concerns
over
global
food
security
(Rhodes,
2014;
Wuepper et al., 2020). Disturbance prevention, especially
fire resistance and recovery, is of particular interest as cli-
mate projections often suggest an increase in fire fre-
quency and severity due to climate change (Halofsky
et al., 2020). The same is true of flooding resistance and
recovery, which is also likely to becoming increasingly
necessary in coming years (Hirabayashi et al., 2013).
While papers dealing with remediation were not usually
included in the results, as they focused on progression of
ecosystems rather than service provision, there were
quite a few papers returned in the search that used func-
tional traits to measure recovery and restoration goals,
another
indicator
of
increased
restoration
ecology
(do Vale et al., 2010; Winfrey et al., 2018).
Several papers from our search discussed trait change
due to climate warming, urban expansion, and/or resis-
tance invasion (Schlickmann et al., 2020; Song et al., 2019).
These studies were not included in our final table, as they
measured changes in traits rather than ES delivery. How-
ever, these studies along with those on restoration ecology
do indicate that traits are being leveraged to provide
insight into current climate and ecological issues. There
were also discussions of the development of planting
and
restoration
regimes
based
on
functional
trait
effects—using trait–service relationships to design sys-
tems via known plant functional trait effects that pro-
vide the greatest probability of desired ES given a
particular ecological risk. For example, the mitigation of
flooding through planning of high soil retaining species
or plans to increase resistance to/recovery after forest
fires through planting of fire-resistant species (Feagin
et al., 2015; Pickering & Barros, 2015).
Three of the ecosystem services searched for—genetic
resources, medicinal resources, and cultural services—did
not have any functional trait associations. The lack of
information on these services is likely due to a two-
pronged—difficulty in defining them, and the already
established standards of measure. Sources throughout the
past decade had difficulty measuring mainly refugium and
nursery function, as well as establishing proper measure-
ments for cultural services (de Bello et al., 2010). For nurs-
ery services (only one relationship found), there is little
information, and it does not serve a concrete and easily
measurable benefit to society, being a provisioning service
(de Bello et al., 2010). This could also be the case for the
less cited services such as refugium (another provisioning
service, with only a single study found), or for medicinal
services (no studies found), which do not provide a great
observable benefit to nearby society (de Groot et al., 2002).
This inconsistency in measurement standard also makes it
difficult to provide conventional measures of these ser-
vices, let alone to connect them to functional traits.
The opposite is true of biodiversity (which had only
one relationship found) and genetic materials. These ser-
vices have accepted measures, with species diversity and
abundance along with phylogenetic diversity for genetic
resources typically acting as measures for these services
(Avolio et al., 2012; Mace et al., 2012). However, their
benefits to society are much more abstracted. Biodiversity
and genetic resources are regulating services—those
functions and processes which allow for the provision of
life-sustaining ecosystems to continue—while refugium
and nursery services are considered habitat services—the
provision of habitat and resources for living organisms to
live (de Groot et al., 2002; de Groot et al., 2012). Although
these services are perhaps the most important (as they
act as the foundation for all the other services consid-
ered), they possess a minimal market value and are often
estimated in indirect costs when their value is estimated
in dollars (de Groot et al., 2012). The reason we see few
studies investigating new and more accurate ways to
quantitatively measure ES for these regulating services
could simply be that there is no demand or interest in
them from a conservation or management perspective, as
they are too abstract (Ruckelshaus et al., 2015).
Along with variation in the number of service studies,
there was also a great deal of variation in the number of
plant functional traits that were found to have statisti-
cally significant relationships to ecosystem services (rang-
ing from zero for some, to 28 for disturbance prevention)
(see Table 1). This could be due to the varying complexity
8 of 13
MIEDEMA BROWN AND ANAND

of the ES in question. Some of the ES have little varia-
tion, for example, medicinal ES, referring to whether or
not plants are used as medicine for human beings, essen-
tially a binary trait. On the other hand, services such as
nutrient cycling are far more complex processes with a
multitude of different nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, carbon,
potassium) being cycled through both plants and soils,
each of which could account for some of the variation in
this service (Hobbie, 2015; Schröder et al., 2016). As the
complexity of the service provided increases, it follows
that the number of indicators for this function/service
might also increase. One service with multiple iterations
and functional trait measures was also observed the case
for disturbance prevention, the most frequently cited
ES. While it is only a single ES, this trait was found to
have multiple types of disturbance prevention, from fire
to floods, to drought and exotic species invasion. Floods
and fires, both disturbances, are extremely different phe-
nomenon with different functional traits that may pre-
vent or resist them (e.g., deep roots and a high percentage
of fine roots aid in flood resistance while thick bark and
fast growth rate aid in fire resilience).
It should be noted that the lack of results for func-
tional trait linkages with services such as biodiversity,
genetic, and cultural resources in this search does not
mean that no functional trait indicators exist, nor, even,
that none have been used. The nature of our search—
focused on plant functional traits and specific services—
was limited to statistical research with specific criteria
and thus was not comprehensive of all possible trait–
functional relationships. For example, there were several
papers on the subject of cultural services, aesthetic ser-
vices that referenced functional traits, and using func-
tional traits as an evaluation technique, but did not
specifically investigate quantitative ties between traits
and services and were thus not included (Goodness
et al., 2016; Sautkin & Rogova, 2018). The lack of quanti-
tative study in the papers found indicates the likelihood
that there are fewer and less well-read papers on these
subjects. Thus, further research on these services and
possible functional trait indicators is needed.
As research in the area continues to develop, and new
trait–service relationships are studied, functional traits
such as SLA, LDMC, and leaf nitrogen hold potential as
economic measures of ES proxies (see Appendix S2).
Multiple services have been associated these traits, and
thus, measures of just one of these traits for a community
could offer rough estimates or proxies for several services.
This is contrasted with more specific and targeted traits
such as leaf tensile strength, number of root tillers, and
photosynthetic rate which have much more limited appli-
cation and would be best suited for a targeted study of a
specific desired service in a limited area. We found that
these traits have only been used in association with a sin-
gle service and would suit a focused investigation rather
than a general comparison of functional assembly or
multiple service provision. This is where a database of
standardized methods would prove particularly useful,
allowing general service provision measures with mini-
mal traits or specific traits that target a service but are
more labor-intensive and focused. Such a database would
allow for selection of traits/indicators to isolate and mea-
sure for the services that is most desired by stakeholders.
This would ensure comparability and quantifiable mea-
sures of service, allow for the customization of testing for
ES, and still provide comparable measures, something
that is very much in demand as research into ecosystem
services continues. Specific indicators would be especially
important for such broad and diverse categories as “dis-
turbance prevention.” For services like this, subservices
in a database would allow for the specific functional trait
associations (i.e., whether, fire resilience or flood preven-
tion that are most desired) could be accurately measured
with a minimal amount of resource expenditure. A list of
all known and measured trait–service relationships could
provide for designing monitoring programs, restoration,
and ES measurement as it is unlikely that there exists a
catch-all trait—a functional trait that indicates measures
of most ES or that measure consistently between diverse
ecosystems. Such a database would also ensure that a
suitably diverse measure of traits could be used to pro-
vide a more accurate measure of ecosystem service provi-
sion, as no single trait, no matter how many services it is
associated with, can account for all the services and func-
tions required in an ecosystem (Damour et al., 2014).
Including habitat type and other abiotic factors may
also prove an important aspect of such a database. We
found within this review, 11 papers reported differences in
trait–service relationships depending on the habitat type,
season or other abiotic differences between plant commu-
nities (Kozlov et al., 2015; Linstädter et al., 2014; Ruiz-
Jaen & Potvin, 2011). This suggests that subsets of plant
functional traits could indicate optimal ES for different eco-
system types/circumstances and that traits could have dif-
ferent, sometimes even opposite relationships dependent
on these factors. Certain functional traits or groups of traits
act as indicators of improved or ideal ecosystem service
delivery for a specific ecosystem (Kozlov et al., 2015;
Linstädter et al., 2014), while others show that they might
remain constant across ecosystem types (He et al., 2010).
These are described as soft traits—those that change
depending on the circumstances—and hard traits—those
that remain consistent (Belluau & Shipley, 2018). Other
plant functional trait–ES relationships are habitat depen-
dent (Sfair et al., 2016), and even season dependent (Hou,
Lu, et al., 2020; Hou, Zhu, et al., 2020), rather than
ECOSPHERE

universal. Since trait–service relationships are often depen-
dent upon the service and the habitat which they are found
in (Kozlov et al., 2015; Linstädter et al., 2014; Ruiz-Jaen &
Potvin, 2011), clarifying regional or ecosystem-specific
plant functional traits indicators is a field of study that is
essential in developing habitat and regionally specific mon-
itoring or measurement programs for ecosystem services.
Despite the acceptance and clear prevalence of trait–
service relationship in the literature, there has been some
recent doubt as to the ability of plant functional traits alone
to predict changes in ecosystem functioning, which would
extend to changes in ecosystem service provision (van der
Plas et al., 2020). Such studies have pointed out the limits
to the predictive ability of using functional traits alone to
predict service provision or changes in ecosystem function
(Lanta et al., 2011). This caution around treating functional
traits as the “Holy Grail” in ecology is also found other
studies which recommend inclusion of traits to increase
the accuracy of estimates and service mappings but refrain
from using traits alone to measure ES (Xu et al., 2021;
Graux et al., 2016). While these functional traits often show
clear correlation along with mechanistic basis for their
influence and prediction of ecosystem processes and
services, it is important that their limitations also be
understood.
With increased knowledge on the functional trait
effects, we have a deepened understanding of which func-
tional traits are dominant in specific landscapes—whether
it is due to management or based on the surrounding
landscape—and this knowledge has the potential to provide
insight into the ecosystem services provided, and the trade-
offs that occur. Given the thorough understanding of plant
functional
trait
responses
to
land-use
intensification,
anthropogenic disturbances, and climate change that has
been developed in the past decade, these functional trait
responses could be scaled up to provide initial answers
about these same disturbance effects on ecosystem service
provision (Bjorkman et al., 2018; Miedema et al., 2019;
Pérez-Camacho et al., 2012). The next step in ecology is to
combine these two, filling in the knowledge gaps and info-
rming restoration, management, and ecological theory
using these plant functional traits as indicators of the pres-
ence and trade-offs of ecosystem service. This is particularly
relevant with the discovery of common trends in functional
relationships across the globe—indicating the potential of
worldwide indicators of service provision (Bruelheide
et al., 2018; Gross et al., 2017; Reich et al., 1997). Combina-
tion of this knowledge, a literature of ES built off of the
foundation of the study of ecosystem functions, would
greatly improve their management, allowing stakeholders
and conservationists alike to predict and respond to the
changes caused by climate and land-use change related dis-
turbances (Chillo et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2019)
CONCLUSION
Plant functional traits offer great potential as indicators of
ES delivery and ES changes, allowing for accurate mea-
surement, mapping, and the development of unique man-
agement and recovery strategies in the face of climate
change and urban expansion. A deeper understanding of
the influence of dominant plant functional traits on eco-
system processes and the services they provide could lead
to a future where management and policy are informed to
the point where ecosystems could be engineered, if neces-
sary, to provide the ecosystem services needed (Storkey
et al., 2015). The use of these plant functional traits to
improve measures of ecosystem service delivery has wide
implications for developing accurate models of the effects
of climate change, as well as scientifically defensible,
policy-relevant, and widely accepted ES quantification
methods (Heink et al., 2016; Polasky et al., 2015). While a
great deal of the foundation has been laid for the applica-
tion of plant functional traits in this capacity, there is still
a great deal to be uncovered, notably the influence of
microbes on both plant functional trait filtering as well as
on ecosystem processes (and thus on ES). This along with
research into habitat-dependent plant functional trait indi-
cators and the development of consistent and comparable
trait measures for under-represented services such as
medicinal services, refugium, and nursery functions and
genetic provision is the next step in consistent and accu-
rate measures of ecosystem services.

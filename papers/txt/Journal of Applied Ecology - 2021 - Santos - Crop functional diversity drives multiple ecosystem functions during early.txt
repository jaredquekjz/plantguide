Abstract
1.	 We still lack practical guidelines for diversifying cropping systems that consider 
both yield and regulating functions of agroecosystems. Recent studies have sug-
gested that maximizing functional diversity (FD, the distribution of species with 
different functional traits in the niche space) may lead to agroecosystems with 
greater multifunctionality due to niche complementarity. Therefore, scientists are 
now advocating the use of a trait-­based approach to develop multifunctional sus-
tainable agroecosystems.
2.	 In order to assess the effects of crop FD on key agroecosystem functions and to 
consider trade-­offs and synergies among them, we established, in late 2016, per-
manent experimental field plots of successional agroforestry systems (SAFS), in 
humid subtropical Southern Brazil. The experiment represents a gradient of plant 
functional trait diversity (designed FD based on leaf nitrogen concentration), while 
maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. Our hypothesis 
is that the observed FD of crops (hereafter, crop FD) drives multiple agroecosys-
tem functions.
3.	 We determined the observed FD by quantifying traits of crops and weeds (maxi-
mum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area) and performed two data collections 
(March and September 2017) at the end of the summer and winter crops respec-
tively. We used structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical causal model 
to explain how crop FD affects three functions: weed suppression, soil protection 
(soil cover by either crops or weeds) and crop yield.
4.	 Our results support the hypothesis that high crop FD drives agroecosystem pro-
cesses and contributes to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions. We 
found that with greater crop FD in SAFS, crop plants occupied a large niche space, 
thereby increasing the total photosynthetic light intercepted in the agroecosys-
tem, that in turn, increased crop yield. Additionally, greater FD increased soil pro-
tection by crops and decreased weed cover. This greater FD also reduced the FD 
of the weed community.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Modern cropping systems attempt to maximize one ecosystem 
service (e.g. food provision from a single crop), but this results in 
a reduction of biodiversity and ecosystem services related to eco-
system regulation (Power, 2010). In fact, some have argued (Isbell 
et al., 2017) that a loss of biodiversity affects ecosystem function-
ing and reduces its stability at the small spatial and temporal scales 
in which species interact with each other. If so, then an increase in 
agrobiodiversity could contribute significantly to the delivery of 
multiple ecosystem services (ES) (Wood et al., 2015).
If this claim is true then agricultural activity could jointly produce 
both commodity outputs (food, fuel and fibre) and improve certain 
other functions such as the management of biodiversity, soil protec-
tion and contribution to the socio-­economic viability of rural areas—­
the so-­called multifunctional agriculture (MFA) (Renting et al., 2009). 
Therefore, recent studies on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning 
have focused on multifunctionality (Allan et al., 2015; Blesh, 2018; 
Lefcheck et al., 2015). Otherwise, our understanding of this cause–­
effect relationship may be limited or biased if trade-­offs or synergies 
among processes and functions are ignored (Blesh,  2018; Byrnes 
et al., 2014).
In order to link biodiversity and ecosystem processes in (semi-­)
natural systems, researchers are advocating the use of a trait-­based 
approach to develop multifunctional agroecosystems, usually 
under the umbrella concept of ‘ecological intensification’ (Abalos 
et al., 2019). Recent studies have suggested that maximizing func-
tional diversity (FD, the diversity of functional traits) may lead to 
agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality (Blesh, 2018; Finney 
& Kaye, 2017; Martin & Isaac, 2015; Storkey et al., 2015). However, 
implementation of this approach is hampered by our limited under-
standing of the relationship between plant traits and agroecosystem 
processes (Abalos et  al.,  2019). Furthermore, very few published 
studies have manipulated FD variation and tested for its effect on 
agroecosystem functions independently of species richness (Tobner 
et al., 2016).
We therefore use a running experiment to test the hypothesis 
that FD of crops affects multiple agroecosystem functions and leads 
to greater multifunctionality. In order to identify trade-­offs and syn-
ergies among processes and functions we used structural equation 
modelling (SEM). This statistical method allows scientists to use data 
collected in the field to simultaneously test hypotheses about sev-
eral, interconnected causal relationships of ecosystem functioning 
(Shipley, 2016). The core of the experiment consists of species mix-
tures having identical species richness but varying in FD. As in other 
long-­term biodiversity experiments, for example, Jena Experiment 
(Roscher et al., 2004), this one was designed to be a long-­term ex-
periment that aim to understand the ecological mechanisms that 
underlie the biodiversity–­ecosystem functioning. Here, we present 
the first results of this experiment, 1 year after its establishment. 
This is a critical period for several applications ranging from peren-
nial agriculture, silviculture to ecological restoration, during which 
weed–­crop competition strongly influences crop establishment, but 
also soil protection with potential cascading impacts on crop yield.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study site
The study site is located on the Ressacada Experimental Farm at the 
Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil (27°41′7″S, 
48°32′28″W). The region has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa—­
Köppen climate classification). Mean annual temperature is 21 ± 4ºC 
with a mean annual precipitation of 1,415 ± 435 mm (mean ± stand-
ard deviation, based on a 2008–­2016 dataset from the adjacent me-
teorological station of Florianópolis International Airport). The soil is 
classified as Aquic Quartzipsamments (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and 
consists of a 60–­50 cm deep sandy layer (10% clay; pH 5.4 and 3.7% 
organic matter analysing 0–­20 cm deep soil sample). The study site is 
a flat agricultural field at 5m above sea level that had been managed 
for rice production for several years before the establishment of the 
experiment. An area of approximately 0.15 ha was weeded using a 
rotating hoe and then crop species mixtures were hand planted (per-
ennials) and hand sown (summer annuals) from 28 October 2016 to 
24 November 2016 and from 10 May 2017 to 12 May 2017 (winter 
annuals). The establishment and management in the experimental 
area are detailed in Table S1.
2.2 | Experimental design
Agroforests were planted in square plots of 9 m × 9 m. The bor-
der around the outermost 0.5 m of each plot was not considered for 
sampling to avoid edge effects and interplot interactions. The spe-
cies pool of crop plants comprised 19 species (Table 1).
We designed the experiment maintaining crop species richness 
constant across all treatments, and varying a single trait to choose 
the species composition of each treatment, that is, the leaf nitro-
gen concentration (LNC) of crops (hereafter ‘designed FD’, that is, 
resistance to competition with weeds and produces higher crop yields in young 
diversified crop mixtures.

FD imposed by the experimental design). We chose LNC as crite-
rion because its value as a proxy of tissue quality is widely recog-
nized by practitioners for being a key driver of mulch decomposition, 
which represents a trade-­off of a given amount of available bio-
mass for mulching between nutrient release of high LNC (low C:N) 
residues on the one hand, and soil protection/weed prevention of 
low LNC (high C:N) residues on the other (Erenstein, 2003; Finney 
et  al.,  2016). Due to the widespread use of categorical criteria of 
species choice by practitioners that simplify tissue quality (Finney & 
Kaye, 2017), we applied a binary dichotomy of crops with high ver-
sus low LNC, with which we composed three intercrop compositions 
with constant species richness. Thus, our designed FD was based 
on plot treatments with crop mixtures of (a) eight species with high 
LNC (>25 mg/g), (b) eight species with low LNC (<25 mg/g) and (cd) a 
combination of four species with high and four species with low LNC 
(called medium LNC).
However, we measured a number of traits to calculate a field-­
established community-­weighted, observed FD per plot (hereafter 
‘crop FD’), used for all subsequent analyses, in order to capture a 
substantial portion of trait variation relevant to short-­term crop–­
weed competition and agroecosystem functioning and performance. 
Observed crop FD was positively related to designed, community-­
level mean leaf N concentrations, that is, plot treatments based 
on broad categories of LNC relevant for practical adoption by land

managers (Figure S1). In our experiment, all crop legumes were puta-
tive N-­fixers (Sprent, 2001).
Each community was replicated six times in a randomized com-
plete block design with 18 plots. Within plots, species were planted 
in four strips according to their growth form and life history (see de-
tails in Figure S2). Within strips, a two species mixture was planted 
at the density according to agronomic recommendations (see details 
in Figure S3a–­f). The distribution of plant growth forms within plots 
was identical in all six blocks. Plants were fertilized with compost 
produced from urban organic residues at a constant rate of 4 L/m 
planting row. For details regarding species, plot type and strips see 
Tables S2 and S3.
2.3 | Data collection
We collected data on strips within the plots, at the full flowering 
stage of annual herbaceous plants, around 100 days after planting. 
Besides using this stage as reference due to management necessi-
ties, all crops were assessed. Specificities of each variable are de-
scribed below. We assessed the following agroecosystem variables: 
(a) Leaf area index (LAI), (b) crop yield, (c) soil cover by crops (here-
after crop cover), (d) soil cover by weeds (hereafter weed cover). 
The last two variables combined were considered surrogates for the 
competitive ability of crops against weeds (weed suppression, i.e. 
crop cover − weed cover) and for potential soil protection (i.e. crop 
cover + weed cover).
Leaf area index (LAI; m2/m2) was indirectly determined using a 
Ceptometer AccuPAR LP-­80 (Garrity,  2014). We positioned the 
equipment above and below the canopy of crops, always above the 
weeds, in order to exclude the contribution of weeds and obtain the 
crop LAI in both rows and interrows. We collected data in two peri-
ods (March and September 2017) on all strips within the plots, at the 
full flowering stage of annual herbaceous species, around 100 days 
after planting. As mentioned above, within plots, species were 
planted in four strips according to their growth form and life history; 
therefore, in order to estimate one average value of LAI for each 
plot we calculated the weighted mean, considering the proportion 
of area occupied by each strip in the plot: (a) erect annuals, occupied 
50% of the plot; (b) shrubs, 25%; (c) basal herbs, 12.5%; (d) shrubs/
giant herbs, 12.5%.
2.3.1 | Crop yield
We sampled crop yield according to growth form and planting den-
sity: (a) basal herbs inside a 0.5 m × 0.5 m quadrat; (b) erect annual 
herbs along a 0.5 m linear transect (and seeds in a 8 m transect); (c) 
shrubs/giant herbs in a 1 m linear transect along the crop row. From 
these samples we collected data of crop products that humans use 
for food or green manuring, that is, above-­ground biomass of the 
species that was achieved at the beginning of its reproductive phase, 
except for jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.), grain sorghum 
(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and showy rattlebox (Crotalaria specta-
bilis Roth), for which we collected seeds because of the demand for 
their germplasm (see details in Table S1). The biomass was dried to 
constant mass at 80°C. First, we collected two randomized samples 
of each species at the beginning of its reproductive phase in each 
plot. These samples were extrapolated to square metres. Second, 
the mean of these two samples was used in order to sum the crop 
yield in each strip within plots, since each strip was a mixture of two 
species. Finally, we used this value to calculate the weighted mean 
(considering the proportion of each strip occupied by that species in 
the plot) to estimate the average in the plot. Due to different scales 
of measurement among plant species, we standardized yield data to 
standard deviation.
where Ci is the crop yield of each strip within plots and pi represents 
the area proportion that each strip occupied within plots (erect annu-
als = 0.5; shrubs = 0.25; basal herbs = 0.125; shrubs + trees = 0.125).
where Wj is the standardized crop yield of each species within strips.
where x is the crop yield of each sample by species (in kg/m2) and s is 
the standard deviation of crop yield considering each species.
For example, considering one plot planted with a mixture of 
Pennisetum purpureum and Cajanus cajan, we measured the above-­
ground biomass in a 1 m linear transect along the crop row, twice, 
for each species. The mean of the samples (extrapolated to kg/m2) 
was standardized, summed and multiplied by the proportion of 0.25 
(considering that the strips of shrubs/giant herbs occupied 25% of 
the plot).
2.3.2 | Crop cover and weed cover
The vegetation composition, species abundance and proportion of 
soil cover (crop cover and weed cover) were assessed in 0.5 m × 0.5 m 
quadrats. All plants (crops and weeds) inside the quadrat were iden-
tified and their abundance estimated visually using a cover percent-
age (Lavorel et al., 2008) in the following categories: less than 1%, 
between 1% and 5% and subsequently in intervals of 10% from 10 to 
100 (Londo, 1976). Within plots, two samples were taken, randomly, 
per type of strip, totalling eight samples per plot. These two samples 
were used to calculate the mean relative abundance for each plant 
species within strips, and the mean of weed cover and crop cover 
within strips. Therefore, the mean of each two quadrats was used

for calculating the weighted mean to estimate the average at the 
plot scale. We collected data in two periods (March and September 
2017) on strips within the plots at the full flowering stage of annual 
herbaceous plants, around 100 days after planting. In all, 36 sample 
units were used for data analysis (18 plots and 2 sample periods).
We used standardized protocols (Pérez-­Harguindeguy et  al., ​
2013) to determine three plant traits (see Table S4) that are related to 
the agroecosystem processes assessed in this work (Table 2; Bàrberi 
et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2016; Gaba et al., 2017). We measured traits 
in all crop species on the most frequent weed species (observed in 
>50% of sample quadrats) and the most abundant weed species 
(that collectively, i.e. consider all species, made up at least 80% of 
cumulative relative abundance in each sample quadrat). This thresh-
old was established to ensure a satisfactory description of commu-
nity properties in relation to biogeochemical cycles in ecosystems 
(Garnier et al., 2004; Pakeman & Quested, 2007). We determined 
traits in 19 of 40 weed species present in the experiment in the first 
period, and in 38 of 76 weed species present in the experiment in the 
second period (see Table S5).
2.4 | Measuring functional diversity (FD)
Functional diversity (FD) were assessed for both crop and weed 
communities. This index was calculated using ‘syncsa’ (Debastiani & 
Pillar, 2012) package in r (R Core Team, 2018). Rao's quadratic en-
tropy (Rao, 1982) has been considered an appropriate measure for 
FD (Botta-­Dukát, 2005; Pillar et al., 2013):
where dij is a measure of distance between species i and j based on a 
set of specified functional traits.
Rao's quadratic entropy (Rao,  1982) is an index of functional 
diversity that incorporates both the relative abundances of spe-
cies and a measure of the pairwise functional distance between 
species (Botta-­Dukát, 2005). In order to obtain a dissimilarity ma-
trix with Euclidean metric properties, the default function built into 
‘syncsa’ package calculates the square root of the one-­complement 
of Gower's similarity index (which ranges from 0 to 1; Debastiani & 
Pillar, 2012; Pillar et al., 2013).
2.5 | Data analysis
Multivariate analysis in the form of piecewise structural equation 
modelling (SEM) was conducted in the R software using the packages 
‘nlme’ (Pinheiro J et al., 2018) and ‘piecewiseSEM’ (Lefcheck, 2016). A 
data exploration protocol was used (Zuur et al., 2010) and performed 
with packages ‘lattice’ (Sarkar, 2008), ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham, 2009) and 
‘ggcorrplot’ (Kassambara, 2016).
An initial general hypothetical model (Figure 1) was formulated 
in order to be tested using SEM. The hypothetical model was used 
as a framework to fit the collected data. After fitting and parameter 
estimation, not all initial variables were still part of the model, due 
to statistical non-­significance (p > 0.05; Shipley, 2009). Additionally, 
considering the experimental design, the six blocks and the two 
periods were considered random factor variables in the model. 
Therefore, we applied mixed effects modelling and restricted max-
imum likelihood (REML) estimation method (Shipley,  2013; Zuur 
et al., 2009).
When the initial model was fitted, Fisher's C statistic was calcu-
lated to evaluate the model goodness-­of-­fit. If the data are gener-
ated following the causal hypothesis specified in the fitted SEM, this 
C statistic will follow a chi-­squared distribution. If the chi-­square is 
statistically non-­significant (p > 0.05) the existing deviation between 
the model and the data is consistent with random sampling variation 
and so the model is not rejected (Lefcheck, 2016; Shipley, 2009).
Exploratory path analysis was conducted by adding or removing 
arrows from the hypothesized relationships. In order to account for 
relations not initially considered between response and predictor 
variables we used the ‘missing paths’ command built into the ‘piece-
wise SEM’, which provides information supported by statistical sig-
nificance to improve the initial model (Lefcheck,  2016; Stenegren 
et  al.,  2017). If this new relationship was statistically significant 
(p < 0.05) and had biological significance, it was included and the 
model was tested again. Subsequently, non-­significant parameters 
were excluded from the model. We used graphical tools in order to 
validate the assumptions of each final SEM. Normality and homo-
geneity of variances were verified on standardized residuals (Zuur 
et al., 2009).

Our initial hypothesized model (Figure 1) was not rejected by the 
data (C = 14.229, df = 14, p = 0.43) but we proceeded an exploratory 
analysis in order to account for relations not initially considered and 
to remove non-­significant parameters. In our final model (C = 14.984,

df = 18, p = 0.66), crop FD is the only variable that drives responses 
in agroecosystem functions (Figure 2). It has a direct effect on (a) 
weed FD (raw regression coefficient, b = −0.5026, p < 0.01); (b) weed 
cover (raw regression coefficient, b = −0.5717, p = 0.03); (c) crop 
cover (raw regression coefficient, b = 0.9299, p < 0.01) and; (d) LAI of 
crops (raw regression coefficient, b = 4.8921, p < 0.01). In turn, the 
LAI of crops directly affects the productivity of crops (raw regres-
sion coefficient, b = 1.0579, p < 0.01). As crop cover and weed cover 
were negatively correlated (magnitude of −0.8943, p < 0.01), crop 
FD increases weed suppression as well as soil protection through 
crop cover, as initially hypothesized. The relationship between crop 
cover and weed cover was modelled as a free covariance rather than 
unidirectional causal one since both can affect one another due to 
reciprocal crop–­weed competition.
The marginal R2 values (in Figure 2) describe the proportion of 
variance explained by the fixed factors. The conditional R2 values 
(in Figure 2) describe the proportion of variance explained by both

4 | DISCUSSION
Designing crop mixtures with high FD may be particularly effective 
for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability 
(Blesh, 2018). Our study suggests that crop mixtures designed with 
complementary plant traits could increase the multifunctionality 
of agroforests. We found that the higher the FD at the agroforest 
plot scale, the greater the amount of photosynthetic light it inter-
cepts. Greater light interception, in turn, increases agroforest yields. 
Additionally, agroforests with high crop FD protect a greater propor-
tion of soil by live crop cover and reduce weed cover. Although our 
results may partly result from other mechanisms (e.g. below-­ground 
niche differences), architectural differences, temporal niche differ-
ences and morphological plasticity are the main ones responsible 
for enhancing the amount of light in mixtures of trees (Sapijanskas 
et al., 2014), and hence most likely contributed to explain the posi-
tive indirect effect of crop FD and crop yield in our agroforestry 
mixtures.
Functional trait diversity can provide multiple benefits in agro-
ecosystems (Martin & Isaac,  2015). However, there are also po-
tential trade-­offs among functions in which increasing functional 
diversity can enhance some and decrease others (Blesh,  2018). 
In our study, for example, crop FD enhanced soil cover by crops 
and decreased both weed FD and weed cover. Weeds are part of 
agroecosystems and contribute in different ways to their function-
ing (Guerrero et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2003). Therefore, some 
advantages of ecological intensification and agroecosystem mul-
tifunctionality are hampered by extirpating weed diversity from 
agroecosystems. Our observed reduction in weed FD was probably 
due to crop resource pre-­emption, which can drive weed suppres-
sion (Baraibar et al., 2018; Mwangi et al., 2007). When crops occupy 
more niches, weeds that would occupy similar niches are suppressed 
by the system. Therefore, increasing crop diversity is an effective 
weed management strategy and can reduce reliance on external ag-
ricultural inputs by several mechanisms (Gaba et al., 2017; Storkey 
& Neve, 2018). Although weeds can compete with crop plants and 
reduce yield (Oerke, 2006; Park et al., 2003), our data did not show

any direct causal linkage between crop or weed cover and crop yield. 
Presumably, the weed community in our systems has not reached 
a level that affects crop yield. Our review of the applied literature 
in agriculture, forestry and restoration, as well as dialogue with de-
cision makers suggests that the choice of diverse species mixtures 
by practitioners is more easily adopted if based on recognizable 
categories (e.g. high versus low) of LNC than on complex a priori 
calculations of gradients of species mean FD. Therefore, in order to 
produce a functional diversity gradient we mixed different species in 
three species compositions. In this way, it is possible that our results 
are dependent on the identity of groups of plants, such as grasses 
(for high yielding of carbon-­rich biomass) and legumes (N-­rich spe-
cies). We are aware that legume species may be an important driver 
in diversity experiments (Hooper et  al.,  2005; Taylor et  al.,  2020) 
and influence results as source of misinterpretation (Huston & 
McBride,  2002)—­that is, by the sampling effect for grass–­legume 
combinations, rather than the niche effect among many species. 
For this reason, more recent biodiversity–­ecosystem functioning 
experiments disentangle legume effects from pure diversity effects 
through appropriate experimental design (Roscher et al., 2018) or 
by excluding legume species from the experimental design (Ebeling 
et al., 2014). However, the plant species selected for this experiment 
are widely used in Brazil and the use of legumes is pervasive in agro-
forestry throughout the world (Duchene et al., 2017). Therefore, we 
consider our results to be applicable to many agroecological prac-
tices and designs. Furthermore, one of the reasons for an increased 
the number of research papers using the trait-­based approach in 
recent years is the promise of its generality, synthesis and predic-
tive ability, despite the idiosyncratic details of each site, taxonomic 
assemblage or geographical location (Shipley et al., 2016). Besides 
the inherent limitations of an experiment, the so-­called trait-­based 
biodiversity experiments (TBEs) are an important next step in order 
to directly analyse not only trait contributions to specific processes, 
but also the relative importance of selection and complementarity 
effects on multiple ecosystem processes (Ebeling et al., 2014).
Although further investigations should address the effect of 
functional diversity on community multifunctionality in a range of 
agroecosystems over time, our results suggest that agroecosys-
tem design should include plants with complementary trait values. 
Therefore, in order to integrate principles of ecological intensifica-
tion in agriculture, which implies an increase in plant diversity, it is 
worth intercropping species that could provide a heterogeneous 
canopy structure and leaf area projection. This design could pro-
mote a more weed-­resistant and productive cropping system, with 
greater soil protection.
The most likely method of improving the environmental sustain-
ability of agriculture is designing agroecological cropping systems 
that increase biodiversity and simultaneously generate multiple 
agroecosystem services (Damour et al., 2018). In this way we hy-
pothesize that by using a trait-­based management and by providing 
a high FD of crops, it is possible to provide high levels of multifunc-
tionality in agroecosystems (Figure 3). We can achieve high FD lev-
els at the field, farm or landscape scale, allowing agroecosystems to 
meet the demands of new community values, such as resilience to 
climate change (Berthet et al., 2019). In order to validate the func-
tional diversity hypothesis (Figure 3), future studies should simulta-
neously assess FD and several relevant ecosystem functions along a 
broad gradient of both taxonomic and functional diversity of agro-
ecosystems, from commercial monocultures to diversified agrofor-
estry systems. By exploring whole-­ecosystem responses to changes 
in biodiversity, long-­term experiments such as ‘The Jena Experiment’ 
have had an inestimable role in biodiversity–­ecosystem functioning 
research (Weisser et al., 2017); however, on-­farm experiments not 
only reflect realistic environmental and socioeconomic contexts, but 
can also involve farmer participation in order to define functional 
diversity management based on goals directly relevant to farming 
practice (Blesh, 2018). Practitioner-­scientist collaborative research 
could help elucidate ecologically meaningful thresholds along con-
tinuous functional trait gradients (such as leaf N or C:N ratio), to 
separate functional groups of crops into an agronomically practical 
classification, without suffering from the shortfalls of crop functional 
groups highlighted by Finney and Kaye (2017). Such agroecologically 
meaningful functional groupings could then serve as simplified de-
cision tool for the choice of intercrop compositions with sufficient 
designed FD, an important research gap that is directly relevant to 
the practical application of our functional diversity hypothesis.

Ecological Indicator Values for Europe (EIVE):

Introduction In Europe, ecological indicator values (EIVs) of plants are a
very widely and successfully used tool for bioindication. The idea is to combine the
expert-based assessment of the niche optima of species along certain niche
dimensions, such as soil moisture or pH, and averaging them across all species in a
community predicts its position in ecological space. Having been independently
“invented” by Heinz Ellenberg and L.G. Ramensky, similar approaches were later
implemented in many regions of Europe for various niche dimensions. Meanwhile,
there are more than 30 such systems, varying in scaling and taxonomy, thus
impeding analyses at a continental scale.
This prompted two author teams in January 2023 to release supra-regional indicator
value systems for Europe, the Ellenberg-type indicator values by Tichý et al.
(2023: “Tichý”) and the Ecological Indicator Values for Europe (EIVE) 1.0 (Dengler
et al. 2023; Figs. 1 and 2). While their basic idea is similar, there are many
differences in the details (see Box).

Performance of the two systems
We used three regional
datasets covering long environmental gradients (one for temperature, two for pH)
with measured environmental variables to compare the relative performance of EIVE
1.0, Tichý et al. (2023) and the two EIV systems valid for Switzerland, “Landolt” and
“Ellenberg”, and did this with four weighting approaches (Aicher et al. in review).
EIVE outperformed all other systems, but particularly “Ellenberg” and “Tichý”, while
no cover-weighting was better than cover-weighting or sqrt (cover)-weighting. Only
inverse niche width, solely available for EIVE and “Landolt”, was minimally and non-
significantly better than no weighting (Fig. 3).
Future developments of EIVE
Currently, we are preparing EIVE 1.5 (Chusova et al. in
prep.). This version will stay with the same five niche
dimensions, but add bryophytes, lichens and algae plus
new and updated EIV systems of vascular plants. This
version to be released in a few months will increase the
EIVE coverage to approx. 20,000 valid taxa (Table 1).

Conclusions
•
Use
EIVE
both
in
regional
and
continental
studies (at least for R and T indicators)
•
Don’t
weight
the
species
by
cover,
but
potentially by inverse niche width
•
Join the EIVE consortium if you have ideas for
further development or testing

effect models. The points inside the boxes are the arithmetic means. NW = niche width.
EIVE is a collaborative, community-based endeavor,
and we envisage already future development steps:
•
EIVE 1.7: addition of further niche dimensions (e.g.
salinity, humus content, CSR strategies)
•
EIVE 2.0: using the EVA database to recalibrate and
expand EIVE
•
EIVE 3.0: release of regional/subcontinental EIVE

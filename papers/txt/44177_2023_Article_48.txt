Abstract
The concept of ‘ecosystem service’ has gained momentum in the twenty-first century to bridge the gap between human–nature 
interactions. However, the challenge remains to map the flow of ecosystem services (ES) for their efficient management. 
Among the multiple existing methods, biophysical assessments provide better knowledge of the state of the ecosystem and 
its mapping for complimentary services. Trait–service linkage is one of the tools to reliably link biodiversity with ES if we 
better understand the role functional traits play in the underlying ecosystem processes. In this paper, we have performed a 
bibliometric analysis of published literature on ES and plant functional traits to identify the current state of knowledge on 
trait–service linkage, biases, research gaps, and challenges. There was a skewed geographical basis for trait–service linkage 
studies; most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of the research focused on supporting and 
regulating ES, mainly carbon sequestration, biomass production, and climate regulation, using a particular set of vegetative 
traits, such as leaf, root, and plant height, and ignored most regeneration traits, except for a few flower traits. A matrix to 
quantify the association between ES and selected plant traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf area, leaf nitrogen 
content, vegetation height, wood density, canopy density, root length, root density, flowering time, flower color and flower 
size) revealed that the two leaf traits (specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) in the linkage have contrasting associations 
with multiple ES. The study illustrated that there is still a considerable research gap in linking plant traits with essential ES 
(biomass production, climate and water regulation). Thus, suggest future studies on ES should focus more on trait–service 
linkage across major ecosystems to underpin key ecosystem processes for better sustenance of ES and human well-being.

1  Introduction
With the ongoing human-induced accelerated climate change 
and mass extinction, it has become imperative to treat biodi-
versity and ecosystem services (ES) as essential life-support-
ing system (Watson et al. 2019). The biodiversity-linked ES 
has a very high economic value, since it accounts for around 
44 trillion USD and contributes almost half of the global 
GDP (Daily and Matson 2008; WEF 2020). The ES research 
community has always aspired to illustrate the contribution 
of biodiversity and the ecosystem toward human well-being 
and to elevate stakeholders’ role in decision-making to get 
rightful ecosystem services (Braat and Groot 2012; Fisher 
et al. 2009; Mandle et al. 2020; Neugarten et al. 2018). After 
2005 when the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) 
report was published, research on ES increased exponen-
tially (Boerema et al. 2016; Costanza et al. 2017). The report 
highlighted that 16 of the 24 ecosystems evaluated were in 
a critical stage, which, therefore, led researchers from vari-
ous continents to set their focus on the science of ES (MEA 
2005; Reid et al. 2005). Presently, more than 20,000 pieces 
of literature on ES are available on Scopus and ISI Web 
of Science databases and reflect that ES has been widely 
studied across the first world countries (US, UK, Europe, 
Australia). China is one of the leading countries in Asia that 
has published studies comparable to Western nations on ES 
(Boerema et al. 2016). However, in India, the focus on ES

research gained momentum a little later after ‘The Econom-
ics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: India Initiative in 2012’ 
(Chopra et al. 2022; Verma 2018) report published.
The mapping of ES serves as an essential tool for policy-
makers and institutions to validate and identify areas of max-
imum importance in terms of natural wealth (Balvanera et al. 
2001; Ivanić et al. 2020). Multiple approaches have been 
developed to map ES for decision-making with the support 
from the institutions, such as IUCN, Natural Capital Project, 
IPBES, etc. (Bennun et al. 2018; Díaz et al. 2015a, b; Hamel 
et al. 2021; Neugarten et al. 2018; Pascual et al. 2017). The 
approaches are, to some extent, complementary to each 
other, as they can provide different sets of results depend-
ing on the requirement. There are also various approaches 
to assess ecosystem services such as economic, social, and 
biophysical; economic and social approaches consider the 
direct benefits the society perceives, whereas the biophysical 
approach illustrates the functioning of the ecosystem and 
the relevance of each species and habitat toward the supply 
of ES (Anda Ruskule et al. 2018). Biophysical approach 
thus increases the emphasis of ES mapping as it provides 
a better understanding of landscape management, elevates 
the importance of nature conservation, and offers better 
decision-making ability for the stakeholders (Duncan et al. 
2015; Lavorel et al. 2011).
Under the aegis of biophysical approach, trait–service 
linkage forms a vital tool to highlight the key characteristics 
that influence ecosystem functioning (De Bello et al. 2010). 
Several studies have shown that for effective maintenance 
of ecosystem processes and services, biodiversity and the 
functional traits of participating species play a crucial role 
(Butterfield et al. 2013; Hanisch et al. 2020; Harrison et al. 
2014). Studies in grasslands have highlighted the role of leaf 
traits, especially the leaf dry matter content plays significant 
role to predict the decomposition of leaf litters (da Silveira 
Pontes et al. 2015; Gaujour et al. 2011; Klumpp and Sous-
sana 2009; Pakeman et al. 2010). Leaf area was found to play 
a crucial role by absorbing airborne particulates and enhanc-
ing air purification capability of the urban neighbourhood 
(Weber et al. 2014). In agroforestry landscape, leaf area 
along with leaf biomass was found to be decisive trait in the 
regulation of water quality (Cresswell et al. 2019). Similarly, 
reproductive traits such as flower colour, flower size were 
found to be important both for pollination in terms of agro 
ecosystem and also in urban ecosystem toward providing 
aesthetic value (Balzan et al. 2014; Fornoff et al. 2017). In 
wetland ecosystem, the rooting depth and total plant biomass 
was illustrated to have significant ES role in carbon seques-
tration (Chatanga et al. 2020).
It has already been well-established that sometimes a 
single trait can be responsible for a particular service; for 
example, flower colour is responsible for aesthetic value. 
In contrast, a single service can depend on multiple traits, 
such as leaf traits and wood traits linked to biomass produc-
tion. Similarly, a single trait can influence multiple services 
to certain degrees; for example, leaf area influences fodder 
quality, carbon sequestration, and phytoremediation (Ali 
et al. 2016; Brown et al. 2013; Burylo et al. 2014; Butterfield 
et al. 2013; Campbell et al. 2012; Chaturvedi et al. 2011; 
Cresswell et al. 2019; De Bello et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 
2018). Extending ecological concept of keystone species, 
some traits are also designated known as ‘keystone traits’ as 
they have the ability to influence the range of ES (climate 
and water regulation) while being indicator to the particu-
lar drivers of change (i.e., climate change and land use and 
land pattern changes). Leaf morphology (specific leaf area, 
leaf area), vegetation height, flowing time and flower size 
are also among those traits that designated as the ‘keystone 
traits’ (Cameron and Blanusa 2016; Hevia et al. 2017; Hu 
et al. 2008). Therefore, understanding trait–service linkage 
provides a better insight into the role of individual species 
in an ecosystem and the human dependencies on these bio-
physical realms for their sustenance, as it will be strategic 
guide to monitor the ecosystem health and functioning in the 
Anthropocene epoch (Cardinale et al. 2012).
Given all the scientific advancements, the question still 
looms about how the community of ecosystem scientists can 
better practice ES research toward a more target-oriented 
decision-making process (Bawa et al. 2020; Díaz, et al. 
2015a, b; Guerry et al. 2015; Mandle et al. 2020). This 
brings us to our objective, to illustrate the current state of 
scientific knowledge on trait–service linkage. Notably, we 
were interested in unfolding the yearly trend and geographi-
cal distribution of studies across the globe, finding which 
ecosystems, services, and functional traits were focused 
more on studying trait–service linkages. The paper also aims 
to illustrate the strength of association between particular 
trait–service links to highlight the significance of further 
research prospective based on those associations.
2  Methods
2.1  Inventory
Literature was collected from two reputed scientific litera-
ture databases—Scopus and Web of Science. The literature 
query was carried out using a single keyword, ‘Ecosystem 
service*’ and ‘Plant functional trait*’, to avoid missing out 
on any literature from the respective domain. In all cases, 
keywords were searched among title, abstract, and author 
keywords (TITLE–ABS–KEY) according to the widely used 
protocol (De Bello et al. 2010; Hanisch et al. 2020; Kumar 
et al. 2022). The combined number of literature collected 
from both databases was 28,268. The query was set between 
a particular time frame of 1997 and 2021. Since it is widely

accepted that the ES concept was formally established in 
1997 with the landmark publications of Daily (1997) and 
Costanza et al. (1997), we chose 1997 as the beginning year 
for the literature survey. Before that, there were multiple 
informal ES concepts, but we avoided including them to 
minimize any analytical errors in the later stages. The search 
item from the databases was limited only to research articles 
published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language.
2.2  Screening
The PRISMA technique was followed during inventory 
selection (Page et al. 2021). PYTHON software was used 
for different stages of screening. Figure 1 shows the detailed 
inventory and selection flow chart with the respective num-
ber of literatures added and removed based on the criteria 
for each step. In the first stage of screening, Python program-
ming was deployed to screen out the duplicate literatures, 
since two databases were involved in developing the inven-
tory of 28,268 literatures. Python code was developed to 
remove duplicates, keeping the first one and deleting the 
later repetitive ones. About 20,753 literatures were short-
listed after screening out the duplicates from the inventory. 
In the second stage of screening, we further deployed Python 
coding to shortlist the literatures which have specifically dis-
cussed ‘trait or traits’ and ‘service or services’ simultane-
ously in their abstract section. It yielded into 474 literatures, 
to have discussed those terms. In the third stage, we used 
manual sorting, all the articles were read thoroughly and 
scrutinized in detail. The focal parameter of the manual sort-
ing was to see if the literatures have quantitatively discussed 
the plant trait–service linkages and thereafter 41 articles 
were found relevant to the parameter. We further carried out 
snowball sampling, whereby we looked into the references 
of the shortlisted 41 articles, and found out 27 additional 
literatures which have discussed plant functional traits and 
ecosystem services from quantitative perspective. Finally, 
68 publications were found suitable for detailed investiga-
tion on plant trait–service linkages studies (Supplementary 
Table S1).
2.3  Analysis
The geolocations of the study areas (if available) or oth-
erwise institutional locations of the principal author were 
plotted on a world map using ArcGIS 10.8. The plant traits 
shortlisted for the analysis included specific leaf area (SLA), 
leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area/leaf area index 
(LA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), vegetation height, wood 
density, canopy density, root length, root density, flower-
ing time, flower size, flower color. All the selected traits 
were based on prior knowledge available from the pub-
lished scientific studies illustrating the supply of important 
ES (biomass production, fodder quality, climate regulation,

carbon sequestration etc.) associated with these traits (Ali 
et al. 2016; De Bello et al. 2010; Lundholm et al. 2015; 
Pakeman et al. 2010; Tadesse et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2019). 
To determine the strength of the association between the 
specific trait and the service in the trait–service linkage, 
the following protocol was used: (a) the literature reporting 
positive associations was denoted by “1”, negative associa-
tion by “− 1”, and no association by “0”; (b) traits with a 
minimum of two associations with any specific ecosystem 
services were only taken into consideration; (c) the direction 
of the associations (positive or negative) was only obtained 
from the result section to eliminate discrepancies, as some 
experiments described in the method sections of the litera-
ture could not yield meaningful reports. Later the overall 
trait–service association was calculated by adapting the for-
mula by Harrison and colleagues ():
3  Results and Discussion
3.1  Trends in Year and Geographic Distribution 
of Studies
The first literature on plant trait–service linkage was pub-
lished by McIntyre in 2008 (McIntyre 2008). After that, 
gradual growth in yearly publications has been observed in 
preceding decades (Fig. 2). The maximum number of arti-
cles (14) was published in 2020.
The trend of publication on trait–service linkage has been 
on the rise since 2008, which could be due to the growing 
consensus on ES research around the globe after the release 
of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report (MEA) in

2005 (Braat and Groot 2012; Chaudhary et al. 2015; Cos-
tanza et al. 2017; Mandle et al. 2020; Mengist et al. 2020). 
ES researchers felt that there was a need to include various 
proxies and methods to evaluate the change in biophysical 
realms and subsequent ecosystem services. If appropriately 
included, this could be a significant factor in the emergence 
of trait–service linkage as the proxy to map the delivery of 
ecosystem services (Brown and Anand 2022; Cardinale et al. 
2012; De Bello et al. 2010; Hanisch et al. 2020; Kleyer 2021; 
Lavorel and Grigulis 2012).
Our review also reveals that, despite some yearly incon-
sistencies in trait–service linkage studies, the trend is still 
upward, which also corresponds to an overall upward trend 
in the publications of the ES literature in general. Further-
more, a rapid increase in publication can be observed in 
2021, which could be attributed to the announcement of the 
UN decade of ecosystem restoration (2021–2030) by the 
UN Secretary-General in 2019. However, the sharp fall in 
2021 can be very well-explained due to the hindrance of the 
fieldwork and lab experiments during COVID-19 (Gao and 
Yian 2021). Although the trends in the publication have seen 
gradual growth, the numbers have been somewhat limited 
compared to overall publication in ES, which has risen four 
times in the last decade (Wang et al. 2021). This illustrates 
that there have been some limitations in field work to col-
lect trait data or a reluctance among old-school ecologists 
to ‘commodify’ nature using the word ‘services’, which 
might have added to the limited publication and studies on 
trait–service linkage. Out of 68 selected research studies on

plant trait–service linkages, 54 were carried out in 66 field 
locations across the globe in different landscapes (Fig. 3).
Result reveals that trait–service linkage studies were pri-
marily done in Europe (28), followed by North America (9), 
Asia (8), Africa (5), South and Central America (3), and 
the least in Australia (1). Only six of the 54 studies have 
been carried out in tropical regions (within the boundary 
of the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn). The distribution 
of the study site has been skewed toward the Western first-
world countries (US, Canada, UK, and Western Europe), 
which can be well-established by the fact that the concept of 
ES and trait based plant functional ecology was conceived 
early in these countries in comparison with the eastern 
and southern parts of the globe. Although in the past five 
years, multiple studies have been conducted in China on the 
trait–service linkages. Thus, China has emerged as one of 
the leading country in recent times to conduct research on 
ES and adopt policies to conserve ecosystems (Daily 1997; 
Wang et al. 2021).
Despite tropical and sub-tropical regions being rich in 
biodiversity and dependencies of large populations on eco-
system services (specifically provisioning services), surpris-
ingly only a few (< 5) studies so far have been carried out 
there. Similarly, less than five studies have been conducted 
so far near the equator. These geographical distribution 
biases in studies will lead to an under-representation of the 
potential trait–service linkage concept held as a biophysical 
tool, since 90% of the global ecosystem services are deliv-
ered from the tropical region (Raven et al. 2020).
3.2  Ecosystem‑Specific Studies
The study on plant trait–service linkage has been carried 
out across all major ecosystems. Of the 68 publications, 
66 focused only on an individual ecosystem. The remain-
ing two publications were framework papers and, there-
fore, excluded from the analysis. Agro, grassland, urban, 
and forest ecosystems were topped with > 10 studies each 
(Fig. 4), followed by wetlands/marshes/peat/floodplain (8), 
brownfield/degraded/mix landscape (5), and oceans/river (2) 
ecosystems. 
The possible focus on agro and urban ecosystems may 
be due to their characteristics as these two ecosystems are 
human-modified; therefore, the trait–service linkage in 
those ecosystems had been already pre-defined and attrib-
uted through traditional and scientific understanding (Anand 
et al. 2010; Santos et al. 2021). However, these studies can 
be circumstantially relevant as control studies to understand 
the application of trait–service linkage as a tool for better 
mapping of ES in natural landscapes (forests, wetlands, 
etc.). Given that the vast area of Europe is covered with 
grassland ecosystems (Smit and Metzger 2008), thus, it is 
not surprising that multiple studies have been conducted on 
them. In particular, cultural ecosystem services have been 
well-studied in urban green spaces, since most green spaces

in urban regions are designed to acknowledge the aesthetic 
and recreational value of plants (Chan et al. 2012).
There is enormous potential to explore wetlands, rivers, 
and other aquatic ecosystems, given the importance of mac-
rophytes and corals in providing crucial ES, such as carbon 
sequestration, water and climate regulation, etc. Studies 
on macrophytes and corals will also generate information 
regarding their biological functions and conservation issues 
that is still short given their ecological role (Hoegh-Guld-
berg et al. 2017; Moor et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2020).
As per the MEA report (Fisher et al. 2009; Reid et al. 
2005), ES are classified into four major categories (Provi-
sioning, Regulating, Supporting, and Cultural). Regulating 
and supporting services have been widely studied in all 
ecosystems compared to provisioning and cultural ser-
vices (Fig. 5). Given its importance and ability to be easily 
quantified, it is more intricately overlapped at times with 
ecosystem functions. Only in the case of degraded and mixed 
landscapes, the study's focus is entirely on regulating and 
supporting services. Provisioning services have been given 
better emphasis in the human-modified ecosystem (agroeco-
system, urban ecosystem) compared to natural ecosystems 
(forests, wetlands), given the self-explanatory reasons that 
the former ecosystems are modified to deliver food, fodder, 
and fuel (provisioning services). Cultural services were the 
most neglected category among all ES–trait linkage studies.

3.3  Plant Traits Studied for ES Linkages
Leaf traits have been widely studied across all ecosystem 
services, especially SLA, LDMC, and LNC (Fig. 6). The 
reason could be the easy accessibility of both primary and 
secondary data sources (through herbarium, published lit-
erature and e-databases; Kattge et al. 2020). In addition, leaf 
traits are more relevant for with the essential services, such 
as biomass production, fodder quality, and nutrient cycling, 
etc. (Ali et al. 2016; Cresswell et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019).
Vegetation height and flower traits were the second and 
third most widely studied, given their linkage with essential 
regulating services of carbon sequestration and pollination 
(Balzan et al. 2014; Conti et al. 2013; Cresswell et al. 2019; 
Everwand et al. 2014; Fornoff et al. 2017; Hoosbeek et al. 
2016; Manning et al. 2015). In the case of wood or bark 
traits, there has been a considerable number of studies in 
the category of provisioning services, as it is directly linked 
to timber production, an essential service. Root traits have 
more or less uniform studies across all the ecosystem ser-
vices, as they are necessary for all the categories of ser-
vices (Bukovsky-Reyes et al. 2019; Chaturvedi et al. 2011; 
Gervais-Bergeron et al. 2021; Marañón et al. 2020).
In contrast to the traits mentioned above, the fruit/seed 
and canopy traits were the least studied. Given that canopy 
traits are perceived mainly to assess cultural services, inter-
estingly only limited studies on canopy trait–service linkage 
were found for urban and forest ecosystems (Lundholm et al. 
2015; Randle et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2018). Seed traits are 
neglected despite their crucial role in the maintenance and 
survival of ecosystems. Data are generally skewed toward 
a few selected trait–service linkages, since most publica-
tions are from human-modified ecosystems, with a narrow 
focus on selected ES (fodder quality, water regulation, bio-
mass production, carbon sequestration, aesthetic value, etc.). 
Researchers strongly advocated that more comprehensive 
studies on trait–service linkage with multiple trait–service 
associations in all the natural and human-modified ecosys-
tems are required for a better understanding of ecosystem 
functionality (Brown and Anand 2022; Cámara-Leret et al. 
2014; Duncan et al. 2015; Faucon et al. 2017; Lavorel et al. 
2011; Moor et al. 2015; Xie et al. 2018).
3.4  Trait–Service Association
This study is the first to illustrate a comprehensive overview 
of the trait–service linkage (Fig. 7), showing both positive 
and negative associations between individual trait–service 
links using approach proposed by Hanisch et al. 2020; Har-
rison et al. 2014. SLA and LDMC, the two leaf traits in 
trait–service linkage, were found to have contrasting asso-
ciations with multiple essential services (biomass produc-
tion, feed quality, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, 
phytoremediation, etc.) of an ecosystem (Gervais-Bergeron 
et al. 2021; Hanisch et al. 2020; Klumpp and Soussana 2009; 
Pakeman et al. 2010). SLA was found to have the strong-
est positive association (+ 1) with most ES, including bio-
mass production, water regulation, nutrient cycling, litter 
decomposition, and aesthetic appeal, and a strong negative 
association with phytoremediation (− 1). However, some of 
the ES (biomass production, water regulation, litter decom-
position) has the exact opposite associations with LDMC, 
which have also been confirmed earlier in several studies 
focusing on trait–service linkages (Bihuňová et al. 2021; 
Cebrian-Piqueras et al. 2021; Helletsgruber et al. 2020; Tas-
set et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019). LA, LNC, root length, and 
root density also had similar linkage associations to SLA; 
however, it varies, probably due to the limited focus on these 
traits compared to SLA and LDMC. Vegetation height, wood 
density, and canopy density followed a similar direction of 
associations with most services, including biomass produc-
tion, climate regulation, and carbon sequestration. However, 
canopy density had a unique and strong positive association 
with recreation value and aesthetic appeal.
Flower traits were found to have a strong positive associa-
tion with cultural ecosystem services (aesthetic value, recre-
ational value), which is expected given that cultural services 
are primarily generated from socio-environmental surveys, 
as the common public notion has always been closely associ-
ated with flower color, size, and timing (Balzan et al. 2014; 
Cresswell et al. 2019; Fornoff et al. 2017). However, the 
associations and their subsequent strengths are subjective to 
the drivers of change, which can vary due to environmental 
or socio-ecological factors (Cebrian-Piqueras et al. 2021).
The limited focus on other traits of the plant may have 
skewed the direction and strength. This may be mislead-
ing for future studies if it only focuses on particular traits 
in assessing complementary ecosystem services. Since the 
distribution of publications on trait–service linkage is biased 
toward specific ecosystems and traits; therefore, there is a 
need to evaluate multiple traits to link multiple ES across 
ecosystems and habitats to understand the true strength of 
the association of trait–service linkage as several research-
ers are advocating (Brown and Anand 2022; Kleyer 2021; 
Lavorel et al. 2011).
Figure 8, summarizing the geographical regions, land-
scapes/ecosystems, plant traits and/or ecosystem services 
so far have been focused or ignored over the years for ser-
vice–trait linkages studies in ES research. For example, most 
of the studies have been carried out in the western countries 
with special focus on the human-modified landscapes. Thus, 
encouraging the future ES researchers to carry out further 
research on service–trait linkages focusing more on diverse 
natural ecosystems of global south regions using multiple 
traits.

4  Future Recommendations
This article has illustrated considerable research gaps in 
the knowledge system of plant trait–service links to vari-
ous degrees. Based on these gaps, we recommend following 
future research directions:
(1)	 More studies need to be carried out in diverse ecosys-
tems from tropical regions that host important and rich 
biodiversity in diverse landscapes dominated by human 
population to understand the critical human–nature 
dependency for ecosystem services.
(2)	 More keystone plant traits including underrepresented 
reproductive traits need to be studied and included to 
better understand linkages between traits and ecosys-
tem services.
(3)	 In addition, lesser-known plant species including rare, 
threatened and endemic species should be studied for 
trait–service linkages to delineate their relationship 
with ecosystem services for better policy developments 
in managing and conserving biodiversity and overall 
ecosystem functioning.
5  Summary and Conclusions
Trait–service linkage is one of the fundamental and essential 
tools to understand the importance of biodiversity in the sus-
tenance of biodiversity-linked ES; however, there have been 
only few trait–service linkage studies so far when we com-
pared them with overall studies on ES in general. Majority 
of these studies were carried out in global north countries, 
where trait based ecological research has already been well-
established. The global south countries are lagging behind 
despite being rich in biodiversity and large proportion of 
their population directly dependent on ecosystem services 
for their livelihood and daily needs. Furthermore, the selec-
tion of plant traits for trait–service linkages were biased 
more toward soft (easy to measure) traits as compared to 
hard (difficult to measure) traits. A trait–service association 
matrix revealed that the SLA and LDMC have contrasting 
associations with multiple ES. The study conclude that the 
global south countries need to join their global north peers 
to study more plant functional traits along with ecosystem 
services from underrepresented geolocations, ecosystems 
using less represented plant communities. We believe this 
study may create more awareness among scientists, conser-
vationists, and policymakers to think in this direction of ES 
research as current knowledge base has its own limitation 
and biases to draw a generalized pattern/trend about ser-
vice–trait linkages due to availability of limited studies from 
limited studied ecosystems.

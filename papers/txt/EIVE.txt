Abstract
Aims: To develop a consistent ecological indicator value system for Europe for five of the main plant niche dimensions: 
soil moisture (M), soil nitrogen (N), soil reaction (R), light (L) and temperature (T). Study area: Europe (and closely ad­
jacent regions). Methods: We identified 31 indicator value systems for vascular plants in Europe that contained assess­
ments on at least one of the five aforementioned niche dimensions. We rescaled the indicator values of each dimension 
to a continuous scale, in which 0 represents the minimum and 10 the maximum value present in Europe. Taxon names 
were harmonised to the Euro+Med Plantbase. For each of the five dimensions, we calculated European values for niche 
position and niche width by combining the values from the individual EIV systems. Using T values as an example, we 
externally validated our European indicator values against the median of bioclimatic conditions for global occurrence 
data of the taxa. Results: In total, we derived European indicator values of niche position and niche width for 14,835 
taxa (14,714 for M, 13,748 for N, 14,254 for R, 14,054 for L, 14,496 for T). Relating the obtained values for temperature 
niche position to the bioclimatic data of species yielded a higher correlation than any of the original EIV systems (r = 
0.859). The database: The newly developed Ecological Indicator Values for Europe (EIVE) 1.0, together with all source 
systems, is available in a flexible, harmonised open access database. Conclusions: EIVE is the most comprehensive 
ecological indicator value system for European vascular plants to date. The uniform interval scales for niche position 
and niche width provide new possibilities for ecological and macroecological analyses of vegetation patterns. The devel­
oped workflow and documentation will facilitate the future release of updated and expanded versions of EIVE, which 
may for example include the addition of further taxonomic groups, additional niche dimensions, external validation or 
regionalisation.

Introduction
Since the probability of species’ occurrence changes pre­
dictably along environmental gradients, plant community 
composition holds valuable information about local envi­
ronmental conditions. This basic notion, conceptualised 
as bioindication, has been a subject of research for a long 
time (see review by Diekmann 2003). In bioindication, 
individual plant species are assigned so-called ecological 
indicator values (EIVs) on ordinal scales based on the 
“optima” or “centres” of their realised ecological niches 
along given environmental gradients (niche dimensions) 
(Smart 2000; Diekmann 2003). “Realised niche” refers to 
the occurrence of species in plant communities under the 
influence of competition (or facilitation) of co-occurring 
species, as opposed to the “fundamental niche” describ­
ing the occurrence and performance in monoculture 
(Leibold 1995). In this paper, we use the term “niche po­
sition” to denote the central tendency of the distribution 
of a species even in the case of skewed or bimodal ecolog­
ical niches. To assess the site conditions of a vegetation 
plot or a plant community, the EIVs of all species present 
in that plot or community can be averaged for each niche 
dimension of interest.
The idea of using the presence of plants to assess site 
conditions by qualitatively matching the most probable 
occurrence of plant species with environmental conditions 
was introduced to vegetation ecology by Cajander (1926) 
and Iversen (1936). Subsequently, Ellenberg (1950a, 
1950b, 1952) introduced the first explicitly quantitative 
approach within an agricultural context. Comprehensive 
EIV systems for the vascular plants of larger territories 
were then independently proposed by Ramensky et al. 
(1956) for the European part of the former USSR and El­
lenberg (1974) for Central Europe. Ramensky et al. (1956) 
published indicator values for grazing intensity, soil mois­
ture and a combination of soil fertility and salinity, while 
Ellenberg (1974; new edition by Ellenberg et al. 1991) cov­
ered seven ecological variables: light regime, temperature, 
continentality, moisture, reaction (pH), nutrient status 
and soil salinity. The high utility of these indicator values 
led to an expansion to other regions, with more than 30 
EIV systems being published so far (Table 1). Some of 
the more recent EIV systems not only expanded the ap­
proach to new regions, but also added other taxonomic 
groups (e.g. bryophytes, lichens), other niche dimensions 
(e.g. mowing tolerance, hemeroby, CSR strategy, organic 
content of the soil, soil texture) or assessed niche width 
in addition to niche position. Very recently, new systems 
with a focus on Europe as a whole have been published: 
Hájek et al. (2020) published niche position, minimum 
and maximum for hydrological parameters for a compre­

Jürgen Dengler et al.: Ecological Indicator Values for Europe 1.0
10
hensive set of vascular plants and bryophytes occurring 
in mires, while Midolo et al. (2023) derived a set of five 
disturbance indicators for more than 6,000 European vas­
cular plants. Recently, Tichý et al. (2023) presented a har­
monized dataset of six of the original Ellenberg indicator 
values for almost 9,000 European vascular plant taxa.
Indicator values are widely applied in vegetation sci­
ence and global change studies. They are suitable to indi­
rectly assess environmental conditions and the drivers of 
observed vegetation differences in time or space (see re­
view by Diekmann 2003). Several factors can explain the 
success of their application. First, environmental variables 
may fluctuate strongly in time and space (e.g. Sercu et al. 
2017), making one-time measurements scarcely repre­
sentative of average conditions or critically limiting ex­
tremes (Shipley et al. 2017). Thus, the appropriate assess­
ment of environmental variables often requires repeated 
measurements (not feasible in many projects) or is costly 
if to be done across numerous plots. Additionally, mea­
surements obtained at different times and with different 
techniques and equipment may not be directly compara­
ble. In contrast, the plant species composition of a site is 
an expression of the species’ responses to the prevailing 
environmental conditions integrated across the study area 
(e.g. a plot) over longer time periods (several months to 
several years). Therefore, bioindication using EIVs offers a 
less time-consuming and cheaper alternative to the direct 
measurement of local environmental variables (Englisch 
and Karrer 2001; Diekmann 2003; Didukh 2012; Zelený 
and Schaffers 2012; Marcenò and Guarino 2015). Finally, 
most historical vegetation data do not contain measure­
ments of environmental data (Dengler et al. 2011). The 
ability to reconstruct past environmental conditions from 
historical relevés (Pignatti et al. 2001; Van Calster et al. 
2007; Diekmann et al. 2019) or floristic occurrence data 
(Finderup Nielsen et al. 2021; Hallman et al. 2022; Scher­
rer et al. 2022) can thus be very valuable in assessing trends 
in environmental change and their effects on biodiversity.
However, the bioindication approach as such, and the 
wide use of EIVs, have also been criticised. One line of 
criticism holds that indicator values have been assigned 
to plant species mainly based on expert judgement, rath­
er than on accurate measurements (Wamelink et al. 2002; 
Diekmann 2003). Secondly, although large regional dif­
ferences in the niches of species have been demonstrated 
(Diekmann and Lawesson 1999; Pakeman et al. 2008), 
EIVs have often been applied outside the region for which 
they were developed (e.g. Hermy et al. 1999). This could 
potentially lead to misinterpretations (Godefroid and 
Dana 2007). Another line of critique has warned against 
averaging indicator values and subjecting them to para­
metric statistics, since they were defined on ordinal scales 
(e.g. Kowarik and Seidling 1989; Möller 1992). However, 
analysing mean EIVs does not lead to statistical issues, 
since the arithmetic means of values of any distribution per 
se follow a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem; 
see Quinn and Keough 2002). Ewald (2003) demonstrated 
the robustness of the correlation of weighted mean of EIVs 
with environmental measurements, even when species lists 
were incomplete. Finally, the use of environmental infor­
mation inferred from plant community composition to 
interpret vegetation patterns and dynamics has been criti­
cised for potential circularity (Zelený and Schaffers 2012). 
However, these authors and Wildi (2016) demonstrated 
proper ways to use EIVs in vegetation ecological studies.
Recent trends in ecoinformatics opened opportunities 
for continental-scale studies of plant community data in 
Europe. Important developments were the emergence of 
large-scale vegetation-plot databases like the European 
Vegetation Archive (EVA; Chytrý et al. 2016) and Grass­
Plot (Dengler et al. 2018), a European vegetation classifica­
tion system (EuroVegChecklist; Mucina et al. 2016) and an 
automated supervised habitat classification for vegetation 
plots in Europe (Chytrý et al. 2020; Bruelheide et al. 2021). 
Rapid environmental change over large regions increases 
the need to perform broad-scale analyses of changes and 
trends in community composition and environmental con­
ditions (Kempel et al. 2020; Leclère et al. 2020; Hallman 
et al. 2022). However, most of the large European vegeta­
tion-plot databases (e.g. Chytrý et al. 2016) do not contain 
in situ measured environmental data, at least not in easily 
accessible forms (but see Dengler et al. 2018). Thus, such 
analyses have to rely on approximate site conditions derived 
via plot coordinates from modelled geodata (e.g. CHELSA: 
Karger et al. 2017; SoilGrids: Poggio et al. 2021), but such 
modelled data are available only for larger grid cells (e.g. 
250 m × 250 m for SoilGrids), while soil conditions can 
change dramatically within metres. Mean EIVs can con­
tribute to solving this challenge by easily linking the wealth 
of relevé data to abiotic conditions. Scherrer and Guisan 
(2019) showed that the application of mean EIVs instead 
of gridded environmental variables doubled the proportion 
of variance explained in species distribution models, with 
particularly strong improvements for light and soil condi­
tions. However, the more than 30 national and regional EIV 
systems lack consistency in scaling and coding of the eco­
logical indicators, as well as in plant nomenclature, imped­
ing analyses at the continental scale. These issues have part­
ly been solved by the recently published pan-European EIV 
systems (Hájek et al. 2020; Midolo et al. 2023; Tichý et al. 
2023) but their coverage of indicators and taxa, respectively, 
is far from complete. Thus, there is still an urgent need for 
an integrated and comprehensive EIV system for Europe.
Here, we aim to fill this gap by developing the Ecolog­
ical Indicator Values for Europe (EIVE), a pan-European 
ecological indicator value system for the five niche di­
mensions most often included in the existing EIV systems 
and most frequently used in ecological analyses. These 
are the three main substrate variables moisture (M), ni­
trogen (N) and reaction (R), as well as light (L) and tem­
perature (T). We achieved this by numerically combining 
all available systems that contained these indicators into 
a “consensus system”. In doing so, we also implemented 
several novelties that should facilitate the future applica­
tion of EIVE: (i) all indicators were scaled from 0 to 10 
on a continuous interval scale and (ii) for each indicator

we provide one value for niche position and one for niche 
width. In this paper, we describe the development of EIVE 
and release version 1.0 as an open access database to ini­
tiate a community-based approach for future updates and 
extensions.
Study area
Our study covers Europe as a whole in the geographic 
sense, i.e. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural and Cau­
casus Mountains. We also included Georgia, whose place­
ment in either Europe or Asia is disputed, and kept the few 
species of the Asian part of the former Soviet Union that 
were included in Ramensky et al. (1956) and Tsyganov 
(1983). This means that according to Breckle (2002) the 
mediterranean (IV), oceanic (V), nemoral (VI), conti­
nental (VII), boreal (VIII) and arctic (IX) zonobiomes are 
included. However, given the availability of regional EIV 
systems (Figure 1), some regions of Europe are covered 
better than others.

We collected all indicator value systems known to us that 
contain assessments of plants regarding their niche posi­
tion (and potentially also niche width) along ecological 
gradients on numerical scales. Of those, we used the 31 
EIV systems that included indicator values of vascular 
plants for at least one of the five most frequent indicators, 
namely moisture (M), reaction (R), nitrogen (N), temper­
ature (T) and light (L) (Table 1; further details in Suppl. 
material 1). We intentionally denote the N indicator as 
“nitrogen”, not as “nutrients” as in some EIV systems. The 
reason is that existing tests of correlations of mean N EIVs 
with measured environmental variables mostly reported 
significant relationships with nitrogen-related measures 
(C/N ratio, potential N mineralisation) (Ellenberg et al. 
1991; Ewald 2003). Moreover, Tyler et al. (2021) defined 
separate indicators for nitrogen and phosphorus.
If several editions of the same EIV system existed (e.g. 
Landolt 1977 and Landolt et al. 2010), we used the most 
recent digitally available version with comprehensive in­
formation. In case of multiple independent systems for the 
same region by different authors (e.g. three EIV systems for 
Hungary), we included all. In total, we had 31 source sys­
tems for M, 24 for N, 28 for R, 33 for L and 23 for T. In Sup­
pl. material 2, we provide all EIV systems of vascular plants 
that we used with their original and harmonised plant no­
menclature (see below) and their original and rescaled val­
ues (see below) for the five dimensions considered.
Harmonisation of plant taxonomy
We first split the original taxon names as they appeared 
in the 31 EIV systems into genus name, species epithet,

infraspecific epithets, rank-indicating abbreviations (such 
as subsp., var., aggr.) and taxonomic authorities. Genus 
names and species epithets were searched for typos and 
rank-indicating abbreviations standardised to “sect.”, 
“subg.”, “aggr.”, “subsp.”, “nothosubsp.”, “var.” and “×”. Ad­
ditions like “sensu lato” and “sensu stricto” were retained 
at this step, but harmonised in spelling to “s. l.” and “s. 
str.” to support name interpretation in the following steps. 
Taxonomic authorities were disregarded, as there is a huge 
variety of spelling variants and they rarely aid in the dis­
crimination of false vs. correct interpretations. This first 
step resulted in the assignment of a (preliminary) harmo­
nised original taxon name.
In a second step, we retrieved the database underlying 
the Euro+Med Plantbase with accepted taxon names and 
all synonymy and parent-child relationships on 2022-03-
21 (Euro+Med 2022). When a harmonised original taxon 
name (not considering s. l. and s. str.) matched an accepted 
Euro+Med name, this name was assigned as our prelimi­
nary accepted name; when it matched a synonym in Eu­
ro+Med (2022), we assigned it to the accepted Euro+Med 
name. All other harmonised original taxon names were 
treated as “unresolved” at this step.
Third, the numerous “unresolved” names were all 
checked by experts to pinpoint reasons for mismatching 
and treated according to one of the following rules: (a) if 
the spelling harmonisation of step (1) had failed for some 
reason, the R code was adjusted; (b) if the reason for the 
non-match was a typo, such as “vemalis” instead of “ver­
nalis”, an epithet erroneously starting with a capital letter 
or a name field containing also the synonym (“Alchemi­
lla baltica=nebulosa”), the adjustments were made in the 
harmonised original taxon name; (c) if we, however, came 
to the conclusion that there was no spelling error, but the 
name was missing in Euro+Med (2022) completely (as ei­
ther accepted or synonymic name), we defined additions 
to Euro+Med (2022).
Our additions fall into four categories and are compre­
hensively documented with explicit definition of content, 
taxonomic authorities and the source of the definition 
where applicable (Suppl. material 3):
(i)	 Hybrids (Suppl. material 3: table S3.1): All hybrids 
for which indicator values were given in at least 
one EIV system were accepted and defined by their 
parents. They were preferentially referred to by a bi­
nomen (or trinomen), and only if this was not avail­
able as a hybrid formula.
(ii)	 “Aggregates” (here used as a generic term to refer 
to any formal or informal taxon between species 
and genus rank; Suppl. material 3: table S3.2): As 
a basis, we accepted the few aggregates, collective 
species (coll.) and sections that were accepted in 
Euro+Med (2022). To these we added all aggregates 
that occurred in any of the EIV systems and those 
that are widely used in vegetation science (e.g. from 
Ehrendorfer 1973; Wisskirchen and Haeupler 1998; 
Juillerat et al. 2017). We additionally defined ad-hoc 
aggregates when taxa treated as subspecies in one 
of the EIV systems had been raised to species rank 
and, thus, there was no taxon concept available in 
Euro+Med (2022) to match the former polytypic 
species. Formal sections were given prevalence over 
informal aggregates; collective species and enumera­
tions of taxa (e.g. “Empetrum hermaphroditum + ni­
grum”) were replaced by aggregates. In cases where 
several different aggregates with different taxonom­
ic extent had been defined for the same species in 
different sources, we defined aggregates s.l., with at 
least one member being an aggregate itself. In con­
clusion, we accepted four types of supraspecific taxa 
on three hierarchy levels: (1) aggregates (aggr.), (2) 
aggregates s.l. (aggr. s.l.) and sections (sect.) and (3) 
enumeration of sections (one case: Rubus sect. Co­
rylifolii + Rubus). All of them were defined by listing 
their accepted member taxa of the next-lower rank.
(iii)	Other additional taxa (Suppl. material 3: table S3.3): 
These belong mainly to three groups: (1) neophytes 
(of which only few are included in Euro+Med 2022), 
(2) recently described or locally endemic taxa not 
included in Euro+Med (2022) and (3) autonyms of 
polytypic species. The latter are cases where a taxon 
is treated as a species with several accepted subspe­
cies in Euro+Med (2022), but the typical subspe­
cies (the autonym) is missing for unknown reasons 
despite it is often the most widespread subspecies 
(e.g. Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulneraria and Che­
nopodium album subsp. album). Native European 
species not automatically matched to a Euro+Med 
taxon were only exceptionally accepted as separate 
taxa (these could be newly described species or lo­
cal endemics); we generally rather assumed that 
these were included in the concept of an accepted 
Euro+Med taxon, but not included in its list of syn­
onyms in Euro+Med (2022).
(iv)	Additional synonyms (Suppl. material 3: table S3.4): 
This file documents all additional synonymic rela­
tionships not included in Euro+Med (2022), includ­
ing those involving “aggregates”.
When making additions, we strived for consistency 
with Euro+Med (2022), respecting the species and genus 
concepts adopted in this source. For example, the origi­
nal hybrid taxon name Chamaecytisus ×versicolor in one 
of the EIV systems is treated as Cytisus ×versicolor be­
cause the genus Chamaecytisus in Euro+Med (2022) is 
included in the genus Cytisus. Therefore, this case led to 
entries both in the “additional synonyms” and the “hy­
brid definition” file. These four files with the taxonom­
ic additions were used to expand the “taxonomic back­
bone” of Euro+Med (2022) to something that we call 
“Euro+Med augmented”.
Further, we identified cases in which the same taxon 
name has been applied to different taxa by different EIV 
systems. Often the same correctly applied name might re­
fer to a concept of different width (subspecies vs. species, 
species vs. aggregate, aggregate vs. aggregate s.l.; see Jan­
sen and Dengler 2010). Rather rare are cases of names that 

Vegetation Classification and Survey 
13
have been misapplied in a certain EIV system. When we 
identified such cases, we documented EIV-specific assign­
ments of the names (“concept synonyms”; Suppl. materi­
al 3: table S3.5). These assignments were then used at the 
end of the taxonomic workflow to overrule the prelimi­
nary assignments of accepted names in these cases.
We ran the whole automated workflow repeatedly over 
all combinations of original name and EIV system until 
only a small number of unresolved taxa remained and 
there were no evident mis-assignments.
Preparation of indicator values from the source 
EIV systems
The 31 selected EIV systems were checked for entries that 
were not in accordance with their defined categories of the 
respective indicators and corrected if needed. Additional 
symbols, such as “~” for indication of fluctuating water 
table in the case of M, were removed. We merged indica­
tor values for moisture if they were defined by different 
growth forms under identical habitat conditions, such 
as M = 11 and M = 12 in Ellenberg et al. (1991), where 
11 means “growing in permanent water, with leaves at or 
above the water surface” and 12 “growing in permanent 
water, with leaves below the surface”.
For those systems that characterised the niche with 
minimum and maximum instead of a single number for 
niche position, we took the arithmetic mean of these 
two values as the metric of niche position. In four EIV 
systems, certain taxa had multiple assessments of their 
relevant indicators (Suppl. material 1). In the case of the 
EIV systems “Austria” and “Hungary_Soo”, which differ­
entiated indicator values of woody taxa according to veg­
etation layer, we considered only the herb layer indicator. 
In the case of “USSR_Ramensky” and “Slovenia”, which 
contained different assessments depending on vegetation 
zone or soil type, we averaged the values per species. If a 
taxon was given as being “indifferent” (e.g. by the symbol 
“x”), we took the average indicator value across all taxa in 
the relevant EIV system as the most plausible assessment 
of its niche position.
Next, we scaled the raw indicator values of each EIV 
system (EIVori) linearly to a range of 0 to 10, with the idea 
that 0 should represent the lowest possible and 10 the high­
est possible value of the respective environmental variable 
in Europe (Figure 2, step 1). We applied an expert resca­
ling in case of T and for the dry end of M, when the defi­
nitions of the individual EIV system suggested that only 
part of the full European gradient was covered. For exam­
ple, in the case of T, this means that one must add three 
more levels to the classical scale of Ellenberg et al. (1991) 
to approximately reach the temperature conditions in the 
southern Mediterranean region, as proposed by Guarino 
et al. (2012). Likewise, Böhling et al. (2002) proposed that 
the driest sites in the southernmost Mediterranean areas 
are one level drier than the most xeric sites in Central Eu­
rope on the classical scale of Ellenberg et al. (1991). On 
the other hand, Böhling et al. (2002) assigned T = 1 to 
a mean annual temperature that roughly corresponds to 
the median of mean annual temperatures in Europe, not 
their minimum. Details of such adjusted “offsets” are doc­
umented in Suppl. material 1. By contrast, we assumed a 
priori that the scales in all source EIV systems cover the

same ranges for the dimensions R, N, L and the wet end 
of M (but note that, in some EIV systems, the full range of 
defined values is not actually covered by taxa). With these 
considerations in mind, the initial EIV value (EIVini) of 
taxon i in the individual EIV system j was derived from 
the EIV value on the original scale (EIVori) as follows:

with
EIVorii,j = original indicator value of taxon i in the

EIVinii,j = indicator value scaled to a European range 
of 0 to 10
EIVori.minj = lowest number that is defined in the 
respective EIV system
EIVori.maxj = highest number that is defined in the 
respective EIV system
EIVini.minj = lowest number scaled to the European 
range of 0 to 10
EIVini.maxj = highest number scaled to the European 
range of 0 to 10
If an EIV system after our taxonomic harmonisation 
contained several taxa that correspond to the same tax­
on of “Euro+Med augmented”, we assigned the arithme­
tic mean of the indicator values to the latter. In cases of 
nested taxa (subspecies in species, species in aggregates) 
we derived EIV values for the superior level by averaging 
the EIV values of the member taxa of the next-lower level. 
This was only done if the taxon at the higher level did not 
have an EIV value assigned in the source.
Creating a consensus system of niche positions
To derive European values of niche position, we applied 
three different approaches to combine the scaled EIVs 
of all systems in which the respective taxon was includ­
ed: (i) median; (ii) mean and (iii) weighted mean. With 
our “niche position” we aim to approximate the position 
on an ecological gradient which roughly separates equal 
halves of species occurrences. Therefore, niche position 
differs from realised niche optimum or mode (the envi­
ronmental conditions under which a species is most fre­
quent and/or reaches the highest cover values), particu­
larly in the case of skewed or bimodal distributions. In 
the following, we describe the “mean” variant, while the 
analogous calculations for “median” and “weighted mean” 
are explained in Suppl. material 4.
The initial indicator value of a taxon i of the European 
consensus system (EIVEini) was derived as follows from 
the scaled values in the individual EIV systems (EIVini) 
(Figure 2, step 2):
EIVEini.mi = meanj(EIVinii,j)
Using linear regression and correlation coefficients, 
we evaluated the results of EIVEini against all ex­
pert-scaled EIV systems (EIVini) for each of the five 
indicators (Suppl. material 5). While many regressions 
came close to the 1:1 line, most had a shallower slope 
(Suppl. material 5), meaning that the range of realised 
environmental conditions in a region was smaller than 
assumed in the expert-based scaling. Only in two cases 
(“Ukraine” and “USSR_Tsyganov” for M) the opposite 
was true (Suppl. material 5). We thus tried to remove 
the remaining major discrepancies in the concepts of 
the different EIV systems using an automated linear 
optimisation (Figure 2, step 3), with aj and bj being in­
tercept and slope, respectively, of the regression EIVEi­
ni vs. EIVini. In this way, the values of both EIVini and 
EIVEini were iteratively adjusted.
EIVadj.mi,j = ajmj + bjmj ∙ EIVinii,j
This numerical procedure standardised all regression 
lines for EIVEini vs. EIVadj to lie exactly on the 1:1 line. 
Subsequently, we created a new consensus system EIVE­
adj from the EIVadj values (Figure 2, step 4):
EIVEadj.mi = meanj(EIVadji,j)
The resulting fit between EIVEadj and EIVadj was 
on average better (i.e. the slope was closer to 1) than be­
tween EIVEini and EIVini (Suppl. material 5). When we 
tried another round of iteration, this resulted in little 
to no further improvement. Thus, we retained EIVEadj 
for the remaining steps. However, the iteration gener­
ally caused a contraction, or very rarely an expansion, 
of the value range, so that EIVEadj did not cover the 
full intended range of 0 to 10 anymore. To remedy this, 
a final step of rescaling (Figure 2, step 5) was applied 
to EIVEadj to get EIVEres as the European indicator 
values of niche position:

Deriving European niche width indicators
To establish a European indicator of niche width for each 
taxon in each of the five niche dimensions, we developed 
a separate workflow for the heterogeneous information 
in the various EIV systems. While some provided only 
a niche position, others provided niche width informa­
tion as a range (minimum and maximum values) or as 
amplitude classes with two to four levels. If a source EIV 
system contained categorical niche amplitude informa­
tion, we harmonised the coding. In Suppl. material 2, 
amplitude classes are stored as “#” for particularly nar­
row amplitude, “I” for normal amplitude, “II” for wide 
amplitude, but not indifferent, and “x” for “indifferent”. 
We considered uncertain information (coded by smaller 
font in Ellenberg et al. 1991) for the purpose of calcu­
lating mean indicator values of a plot as equivalent to a 
wide amplitude (II).
For the further calculations, we chose the final out­
comes of the EIVE niche position calculation, i.e. the 
rescaled values (EIVEres) of the best variant according to 
the external validation (see below). In EIV systems j with 
range-based niche width coding, we derived the ampli­
tude of taxon i (EIV.ai,j) as follows (Figure 2, step 7):
.
, = (
.

If, for a certain taxon in a range-based system, mini­
mum and maximum were the same (EIVori.maxi,j = EIVori.
mini,j), we assigned to EIV.ai,j half of the minimum non-ze­
ro amplitude that occurred for other taxa in this system 
to account for the fact that a niche width of zero does not 
exist. In case of EIV systems with categorical niche width 
coding, we assumed standard widths w for each of the four 
categories on the scale of 0 to 10, namely # → 1.25, I → 2.5, 
II → 5 and x → 7.5 (Figure 2, step 8). In absence of precise 
definitions (which was the case for most of the sources), 
we assume that these assignments should generally reflect 
the intended meaning of the authors, at least their relative 
relationships. The final amplitude of taxon i in EIV system 
j (EIV.ai,j) was calculated as follows (note that here EIVini 
and not EIVori had to be used as starting point):
EIV a
w
max EIVres
min EIVres
max EIVini
min EIVini

To derive European indicators for niche width 
(Figure 3), we applied three different approaches to com­
bine the rescaled niche position and niche width indi­
cators of all EIV systems (Figure 2, step 9). They were 
constructed to meet the idea that the niche width at the 
European level is composed of intraregional and interre­
gional variability in the niches. In the following, we de­
scribe the “nw3” variant, while the analogous calculations 
for “nw1” and “nw2” are explained in Suppl. material 4.
The nw3 indicator was calculated as the sum of the 
average amplitude of taxon i across EIV systems (intra­
regional variation) and twice the population standard de­
viation (σ) of the niche position (interregional variation), 
bounded to a maximum of 10:

Comparing EIVE temperature indicators with 
bioclimate
For one selected niche dimension, the temperature indica­
tor, we validated our three consensus approaches for niche 
position calculation (median, mean and weighted mean) 
by comparing their results for species with the bioclimat­
ic characteristics of these species globally. The T indicator 
was chosen since the temperature niche is relatively easy to 
calculate from readily available independent data. For this 
purpose, we correlated the T values of species (not consid­
ering other taxonomic ranks) with the temperature charac­
teristics derived from their geographic distributions. These 
were retrieved from the Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility portal (GBIF 2022; Suppl. material 6) for 9,446 spe­
cies (85% of the species in EIVE; if several EIVE species cor­
responded to the same GBIF species, they were not consid­
ered). The corresponding approx. 145 million distribution 
records were subsequently thinned to one coordinate per 
species and 30 arc second grid cell to reduce the bias of local 
oversampling. In addition, occurrences marked as managed 
in the GBIF database (field EstablishmentMeans) were not 
used for further analysis. From the remaining approx. 65.8 
million coordinates, we extracted for each species nineteen 
bioclimatic variables from CHELSA V2.1 (Karger et al. 
2017, 2021) with the same spatial resolution of 30 arc sec­
onds and calculated the median of each variable. Out of all 
nineteen bioclimatic variables, the variable bio10, i.e. mean 
daily mean air temperature of the warmest quarter, showed 
the highest Pearson correlation with our EIVE-T values (in 
each of the three variants, see above). Subsequently, we com­
pared the three variants to combine the rescaled individual 
EIV systems into a European consensus system with bio10 
median values, defining the best-performing approach as 
EIVE 1.0. This system was then used for further compar­
isons, namely with the T values of the 23 source EIV sys­
tems that contained T. Moreover, we also compared EIVE 
1.0 with the European T values recently proposed by Tichý 
et al. (2023). For all comparisons, Pearson correlations were 
calculated for the subset of species co-occurring in EIVE 
and the respective EIV system, and the most highly corre­
lated bioclimatic variable was determined for both EIVE 
and the EIV system. For the evaluation of our three variants 
to calculate EIVE niche width, we used the same CHEL­
SA bioclimatic data and GBIF coordinates but calculated 
the interquartile range (IQR) and the standard deviation of 
bio1 and bio10. The comparison of the EIVE temperature 
indicator with bioclimate was performed in R (R Core Team 
2022) using the R packages rgbif (Chamberlain et al. 2023) 
and terra (Hijmans 2022).
Results
Data processing
After taxonomic harmonisation, the 31 source EIV sys­
tems contained between 34 (Sweden_Diekmann) and 
6,470 (Alps) vascular plant taxa with at least one of the 
five niche dimensions assessed. The combined data com­
prised 77,795 rows of taxon name × EIV system combina­
tions, corresponding to 14,835 accepted taxa: 22 sections, 
60 aggregates s.l., 664 aggregates, 11,148 species, 2,899 
subspecies and 42 varieties. Of these, 13,017 were from 
Euro+Med (2022) while 1,819 were EIVE additions to the 
taxonomic backbone. Only 22 (0.03%) of all taxon name 
× EIV system combinations remained unresolved for the 
time being, meaning that we did not decide whether they 
are separate taxa or synonyms of other taxa. The European 
consensus system of the five niche dimensions contains 
between 13,748 and 14,714 accepted taxa, with an average 
of 4 and more assessments underlying each EIVE value 
(Table 2).
The iterative workflow to derive EIVE 1.0 clearly im­
proved the congruence of the EIVE scaling to that of the 
individual EIV systems, as can be seen in an increase of 
the mean slope of the linear regressions from EIVEini 
vs. EIVini to EIVEres vs. EIVres (Suppl. material 5): the 
mean slope based on the mean variant for M improved 
from 0.872 to 0.878, for N from 0.756 to 0.775, for R from 
0.709 to 0.722, for L from 0.755 to 0.761 and for T from 
0.746 to 0.801 (Suppl. material 5: table S5.1). The iteration 
particularly brought those EIV systems closer to the 1:1 
line that deviated strongest, as can be seen in the strong 
reduction of the absolute values of the extreme deviations 
to about one seventh to one half (columns “min diff.” and 
“max. diff.” in Suppl. material 5: table S5.1). The various 
steps of transformation (Figure 3) in most cases caused a 
contraction of the value ranges of individual EIV systems 
from EIVini to EIVres (after simple expert-based rescaling 
to 0…10; see Suppl. material 5).
Performance of the consensus systems
The Pearson correlation between EIVE-T values and me­
dian bio10 values was highest for the calculation variant 
“mean” (r = 0.859; see Figure 4) and showed minimal­
ly lower values for “median” (r = 0.857) and “weighted 
mean” (r = 0.857). Thus, we accepted the values of the 
consensus variant “mean” as the niche position indicators 
in EIVE 1.0 and used them for further comparisons with 
individual EIV systems. In addition to the bioclimatic

cepted taxa x EIV systems in which they were assessed) 
and mean number of assessments on which the consensus

variable bio10, “mean annual air temperature” (bio1) was 
also frequently identified as the most highly correlated bi­
oclimatic variable for the restricted species subsets “medi­
an” (r = 0.857) and “weighted mean” (r = 0.857). Only in 
two cases did the original EIV-T values show higher cor­
relations with other bioclimatic variables: bio5, i.e. “mean 
daily maximum air temperature of the warmest month” 
for “Austria_Pannonian” and bio8, i.e. “mean daily mean 
air temperatures of the wettest quarter” in the case of 
“Greece”. Correlations of EIVE-T were in general higher 
than those of both the EIV-T values of the original EIV 
systems and the European Ellenberg-type indicator values 
(Tichý et al. 2023) (Table 3).
The distribution of interregional niche width met­
rics (position range and position standard deviation) 
was very skewed, with many 0 values, whereas the dis­
tribution of intraregional metrics (average amplitude) 
showed multimodality. However, the three variants of 
composite niche width metrics showed a more homo­
geneous distribution (Suppl. material 7: figure S7.1). 
Therefore, we decided to choose one of these three com­
posite metrics as consensus niche width. The first one 
(“nw1”), as the total range, generally had the highest val­
ues and was very sensitive to extreme position and am­
plitude values in some individual systems. The second 
one (“nw2”) is partly based on position range and may 
also be strongly influenced by extreme position values. 
The third one (“nw3”) generally had the lowest values 
and was less sensitive to extreme regional values. The 
Pearson correlation between EIVE-T niche width values 
and the standard deviation of bio1 and bio10 values was 
higher for variant “nw3” (r = 0.160 and 0.133, respec­
tively) than for the variants “nw2” (r = 0.143 and 0.106) 
and “nw1” (r = 0.087 and 0.030) (Suppl. material 7: fig­
ure S7.2). Thus, we decided to retain “nw3”, a composite 
niche width metric based on intraregional average am­
plitude and interregional dispersion of niche position, as 
the niche width indicator in EIVE 1.0.
Properties of EIVE 1.0
Per definition, the five EIVE indicators for niche posi­
tions cover the full range of 0 to 10. Plotting the number 
of plant species in the European species pool on the five 
niche dimensions revealed characteristic patterns (Figure 
5a). EIVE-T showed an almost symmetric distribution of 
species centred around middle temperatures (EIVE-T ≈ 
5), while the remaining four other indicators were asym­
metrically distributed. The EIVE distribution was skewed 
towards higher values in case of EIVE-R and EIVE-L but 
towards lower values in case of EIVE-M and EIVE-N 
(Figure 5a). Given that the source EIV systems were all 
ordinal with mostly only a few categories, it is interesting

of EIVE 1.0 (mean approach) and median values of the

cies by least squares linear regression. Species occurring 
in at least four EIV systems are displayed in blue and the 
fitted regression line for this species subset is shown in 
red. Species which were covered by less than four EIV 
systems are in grey.

width. Equal-area violin plots are displayed with median

that the resulting value distribution of the EIVE indica­
tors was rather smooth, as would be expected for an inter­
val-scaled variable. Only EIVE-M had two main modes 
at 3.3 and 4.3, while EIVE-L had a main mode at 8.2 and 
a subordinate mode at 9.5, but even in these cases the 
modes were not clearly separated.
The selected EIVE niche width measure based on both 
intra- and interregional variation showed remarkably sim­
ilar patterns across the five niche dimensions (Figure 5b). 
All distributions were strongly skewed towards narrow 
niche width, with a pronounced main mode of the value 
distribution somewhere between 2.5 and 2.9 (Figure 5b). 
The potential value range up to 10 was (almost) covered 
only by a small number of taxa in all indicators. The mean 
EIVEnw values were lowest for moisture (3.2) and highest 
for nitrogen and reaction (3.8). The value distribution was 
smooth, as would be expected for an interval-scaled vari­
able. Only EIVEnw-M had a subordinate mode at 4.2 in 
addition to the main mode at 2.5 (Figure 5b).
Database
The main part of the EIVE 1.0 database is a table with 
(1) the accepted taxon names, (2) the taxon rank, (3) the 
source of the taxon concept (Euro+Med, EIVE addition, 
unresolved) and then for each of the five niche dimen­
sions (M, N, R, L, T) (4) the niche position value (e.g. 
EIVE-M for moisture), (5) the niche width indicator (e.g. 
EIVE-M.nw) and (6) the number of source EIV systems 
on which the consensus values were based (EIVE-M.n) 
(Suppl. material 8). Further, we provide all source EIV 
systems with their original and harmonised taxon names 
and the corresponding name in our taxonomic backbone, 
together with the original and rescaled niche position 
and, where available, niche width information (Suppl. 
material 2). Finally, our documentation of all taxonomic 
deviations from Euro+Med (2022) forms part of the data­
base (Suppl. material 3).
In addition to the online appendix of this paper, the 
EIVE 1.0 database is available at https://zenodo.org/re­
cord/7534792. The R code to derive EIVE from the source 
files and to produce the figures and statistics of this pa­
pers is available upon request from F.J. A source file to be 
used for the calculation of mean EIVEs in the software 
JUICE (Tichý 2002) is provided at: https://www.sci.muni.

regional EIVs with the European variants for niche posi­
tion and niche width is available as a Shiny App at https://

Discussion
Content of EIVE 1.0
EIVE 1.0 provides assessments of ecological niche position 
and niche width for a total of 14,835 vascular plant taxa, 
including 11,148 at species rank. In terms of taxa covered, 
EIVE 1.0 is thus the most comprehensive ecological indica­
tor value system published so far. In comparison, the most 
extensive source system of EIVE, Landolt et al. (2010), 
contains 6,471 vascular plant taxa. Compared to the su­
pranational Ellenberg-type indicator values developed in 
parallel by Tichý et al. (2023) with 8,908 accepted vascular 
plant taxa, EIVE has a 67% larger coverage (Table 4). While 
the exact number of vascular plant taxa occurring in Eu­
rope in the geographic sense is not known, we judge that a 
majority are included in EIVE 1.0, as we combined many 
national and regional EIV systems, most of them aiming 
at comprehensive coverage of the vascular plant flora of 
their focal territory. In comparison, Flora Europaea (Tutin 
et al. 1964–1980) enumerated 11,557 accepted species in 
Europe (but this number excludes most neophytes and any 
species described after the publication). Moreover, most 
of the countries lacking a dedicated EIV system host very 
few species that do not occur in neighbouring countries 
(e.g. Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark). We expect areas 
with non-negligible fractions of missing taxa to be concen­
trated in Mediterranean Iberia and the Balkan Peninsula.
We decided to include five indicators in EIVE 1.0, 
namely the three soil-related indicators, moisture, nitro­
gen and reaction, as well as light and temperature. We se­
lected these five because – apart from continentality and 
salinity – they have the highest coverage in the 31 avail­
able EIV systems addressing multiple particularly import­
ant dimensions of the ecological niches of plants at the 
same time. Continentality and salinity could be calculated 
with our approach relatively easily. However, we refrained 
from this step for the time being because we believe that, 
in their current form, these two indicators would not be 
compatible with the rest of the system. For continentality, 
Berg et al. (2017) highlighted the challenges of the current 
assessments and proposed an alternative approach, al­
though this is not yet available for a large fraction of the 
European vascular plant flora.
The majority of the source EIV systems had no in­
formation on niche width (e.g. Ambros 1986; Frank and 
Klotz 1990; Hill et al. 2004; Julve 2022), or distinguished 
only between species with definitive indicator values and 
“indifferent” species (e.g. Zólyomi et al. 1967; Mayor López 
1999) (Table 1). However, a considerable number of EIV 
systems did actually provide information on niche ampli­
tudes by explicitly listing minima and maxima on the niche 
axes (e.g. Ramensky et al. 1956; Tsyganov 1983; Didukh 
2011; Hájek et al. 2020) or systematic coding of three or 
four niche-width categories (Böhling et al. 2002; Landolt 
et al. 2010). However, EIVE is the first indicator value sys­
tem to provide a systematic and consistent assessment of 
niche width. Interestingly, our calculation approach “nw3” 
performed best in terms of external validation for the tem­
perature niche axis. This might be explained by the fact 
that using twice the standard deviation instead of the total 
range of niche positions across EIV systems (as in “nw1” 
and “nw2”) suppresses extreme outliers, which could be 
typos in the source systems (e.g. EIV-L = 9 for Abies alba 
on the 9-step scale in Frank and Klotz 1990). In addition to 
niche position, niche width is the second main parameter 
to describe an ecological niche, thus making the character­
isation of the ecological behaviour of species more com­
prehensive. Beyond that, we predict that by taking niche 
width into account when calculating mean ecological in­
dicator values, one could improve prediction at the plot 
scale. In the past, this has often been attempted using a yes/
no approach, i.e. disregarding species with the widest nich­
es (those assessed as indifferent or “x”), but we judge that a 
weighting approach accounting for continuous variation in 
niche width will improve predictions. There is hardly any

experience on how such a weighting approach could best 
be applied, but Hájek et al. (2020) recently showed that it 
generally improves prediction. Hence, the niche width val­
ues reported in EIVE have potential to improve plot-level 
weighting of indicator values in the future.
Taxonomic scope and concepts
We decided to follow the nomenclature and taxonomic 
concepts of the Euro+Med PlantBase (Euro+Med 2022) as 
much as possible, as this was considered the most com­
plete and authoritative taxonomic database covering all of 
Europe. However, most of our sources were based on na­
tional and older taxonomic references. Many discrepancies 
could be corrected automatically with our R code based on 
the lists of synonymous names included in the Euro+Med 
database. However, some species (mostly neophytes and 
hybrids) found in our source lists were absent from Eu­
ro+Med (2022) and thus had to be added manually using 
other sources. Such handling may introduce errors, but all 
of the taxa we added are fully documented (Suppl. material 
3) and may thus easily be reassigned in future versions of 
EIVE if errors are encountered and reported.
Combining the EIVs of lower-rank taxa to obtain EIVs 
for species or species aggregates is another issue that may 
warrant some more work in future versions of EIVE, and 
which may be greatly facilitated by expected future results of 
ongoing projects such as the “Atlas Florae Europaeae” (Jalas 
and Suominen 1972 et seq.). Ideally, EIVs for such aggre­
gates, as well as for species comprising several subspecific 
taxa, should consider the relative geographic range and pop­
ulation size of the different included subordinate taxa, but 
since such sufficiently detailed and authoritative information 
is currently not available for all taxa, we decided to calculate 
EIVs for taxa of higher rank by simply averaging niche po­
sitions across all subordinate taxa. Although this method is 
admittedly suboptimal, it is simple and transparent, and it 
does not introduce any hidden errors caused by faulty bio­
geographic information. When considered appropriate for 
particular purposes (e.g. regional studies), the EIVs for these 
aggregate taxa can easily be re-calculated by individual us­
ers from the EIVs we provide for subordinate taxa. Further­
more, we only applied the aggregation when the source EIV 
system did not provide EIVs for the higher level itself.
Instead of aiming at an unachievable “perfect” taxonom­
ic backbone, we developed decent and well-documented 
solution. With only 0.03% “unresolved” combinations of 
original taxon name × EIV systems, our rate is almost sure­
ly lower than that of pure taxonomic databases, such as 
Euro+Med (2022) or WFO (2022). We also worked inten­
sively on concept synonymy (Jansen and Dengler 2010), 
i.e. cases where the exactly same name refers to a different 
taxonomic content in different EIV systems. While typical 
taxonomic matching software is not able to address this 
crucial point, our experts overwrote the automatic assign­
ments with their expertise for 1,413 original taxon name × 
EIV system combinations (Suppl. material 3: table S3.5), 
leading to a content-wise much better match. While such a 
work essentially never can be completed, our documenta­
tion facilitates the detection of errors and inconsistencies 
by users, who are welcome to report such issues to the lead 
author for taxonomy (J.D.). In the forthcoming releases of 
EIVE, such issues can then be easily updated in our auto­
mated workflow in parallel to a continuous adjustment to 
up-to-date taxonomic concepts in Europe.
Performance of EIVE 1.0
While it was beyond the scope of this paper to test the 
prediction accuracy of mean indicator values based on 
EIVE 1.0 for specific environmental variables, our exem­
plary validation using the temperature indicator showed 
a strong positive correlation between EIVE-T values and 
independent estimates of the temperature niche based 
on CHELSA bioclimate variables and GBIF occurrence 
records. Moreover, the correlation between our EIVE-T 
and bio10 or bio1 median values turned out to be better 
than that of any of the original EIV systems, albeit only 
slightly better than the system of Tichý et al. (2023), which 
also covers large parts of Europe (but was based on only 
six source systems for T, compared to 23 in the case of 
EIVE 1.0). The superior correlation of our combined sys­
tem might be unexpected at first glance, given the fact that 
ecological responses of species can shift along geographic 
gradients and regional indicator values may thus be ex­
pected to capture the regional species’ preferences better. 
While this pattern needs to be confirmed by testing the 
correlations of mean EIVE vs. mean EIV values against 
measured environmental factors of vegetation plots in re­
gional contexts, a test doing so with a “beta version” of 
EIVE, based on a much smaller number of source EIV 
systems than EIVE 1.0, found indeed a superiority of the 
EIVE approach over the regional EIV system in the ma­
jority of datasets with measured soil variables (volumetric 
water content, C/N ratio and pH in H2O; Moeys 2020).
One explanation for the good performance of EIVE 
might be that each of the included EIV systems is best 
understood as a single expert assessment, and every ex­
pert necessarily over- or underestimates niche positions of 
many species equivalent to “random measurement errors”. 
The more such independent assessments are combined, the 
closer they should get to reality, which is supported in our 
comparison (Figure 4) by a higher correlation for species 
occurring in at least four lists (r = 0.912 compared to the 
overall correlation r = 0.859). This effect might also explain 
why a combination of 23 systems (EIVE-T 1.0) performed 
better than that of only six systems (Tichý et al. 2023). An­
other explanation could be that by combining EIVs from a 
larger part of the geographic range of a species, we obtain a 
better estimate of the niche of the species as a whole, at least 
for temperature. While clearly advantageous for studies at 
broad geographic scales, the latter possible explanation may 
suggest that the regional EIV systems may still perform 
better within their individual geographic ranges. However, 
determining whether and when this is the case will require 
extensive testing (but see Moeys 2020).

Limitations of EIVE 1.0
We present a mathematically derived combination or 
“consensus system” of 31 individual EIV systems. One 
could thus argue that we are inheriting the limitations of 
the regional EIV systems, mainly being based on expert 
assessments rather than on statistical analyses of in situ 
measured environmental variables. While it was beyond 
the scope of this article to conduct comprehensive tests 
against measured environmental variables at the Euro­
pean scale, the often-demonstrated close relationship be­
tween mean regional EIVs and measured environmental 
variables (Ellenberg et al. 1991; Schaffers and Sýkora 2000; 
Ewald 2003; Lawesson 2003; Wamelink et al. 2022) and 
the indications that EIVE performs at least as well as the 
existing EIV systems (Moeys 2020; Table 3) support the 
general validity of the approach.
Another limitation of EIVE is that, given the unequal 
spatial distribution of source EIV systems (Figure 1), the 
suitability and validity of EIVE will likely vary between re­
gions. On the one hand, Figure 4 suggests that EIVE indi­
cator values become more reliable if they are based on more 
source EIV systems. On the other hand, it is likely that in 
certain parts of Europe the average fraction of species per 
plot that have assigned values in EIVE 1.0 will be lower, and 
thus the predictions based on mean EIVE values might be 
less reliable (Ewald 2003). This potential limitation should 
mainly affect the Mediterranean parts of the Iberian Penin­
sula and the central parts of the Balkan Peninsula.
Lastly, while we are expanding the characterisation of 
the ecological niche of species to two parameters per niche 
dimension, i.e. niche position and niche width, and thus 
go beyond the majority of existing EIV systems, one could 
still consider this too simplistic. While these two parame­
ters can be statistically defined for species response curves 
along environmental gradients of any shape, they provide 
incomplete descriptions in case of skewed or bimodal 
distributions (Jansen and Oksanen 2013). Since the EIV 
source systems practically never contained more precise 
information on response curves (except very rare cases 
that indicated bimodality), our consensus approach did 
not allow to derive such information for EIVE 1.0 (but see 
below for future plans).
Potential of EIVE 1.0
The main motivation for the creation of EIVE was the de­
mand to have plot-based assessments of environmental 
conditions carry a broader set of meaningful predictors 
in macroecological studies of vegetation plots. Since the 
largest vegetation-plot databases globally, EVA (Chytrý et 
al. 2016) and sPlot (Bruelheide et al. 2019), do not provide 
in situ measured environmental variables (except slope as­
pect, inclination and elevation), researchers were hitherto 
forced to find “work-arounds”. The main approach was 
to use modelled environmental data for grid cells. This is 
well-established for climate data, e.g. WorldClim (Fick and 
Hijmans 2017) and CHELSA (Karger et al. 2017), but less 
developed and explored for other environmental variables, 
some of which may be expected to show more local vari­
ation. Therefore, the majority of continental-scale studies 
of vegetation in Europe, be it macroecological studies (e.g. 
Thuiller et al. 2005; Boonman et al. 2021; Dembicz et al. 
2021) or characterisation of vegetation units (e.g. Marcenò 
et al 2018, 2019; Bonari et al 2021) restricted themselves 
to coarsely gridded climate data, despite extensive knowl­
edge that soil variables and disturbance regime are at least 
as decisive in shaping plant community composition. In 
one of the few attempts thus far to include gridded data 
of other environmental variables in a broad-scale analysis 
of vegetation-plot data, such as soil properties, Bruelheide 
et al. (2018) found a very low predictive power. This was 
probably driven by the fact that the global or continental 
geodatasets have modelled, not measured variables, and 
they are provided at resolutions of ca. 1 km for climate 
(Karger et al. 2017; but see Haesen et al. 2021) and 250 m 
for soil variables (Poggio et al. 2021), while microclimate 
(Pincebourde and Salle 2020) and soil conditions (Sercu et 
al. 2017) can change drastically within a few metres. Thus, 
EIVE can support the development of better models of 
vegetation properties – such as species richness or species 
composition – in Europe and might motivate vegetation 
ecologists on other continents to develop similar systems. 
As recently shown by Scherrer and Guisan (2019) in a re­
gional context, the predictive power of species distribution 
models improved considerably when fed with mean plot-
based EIVs vs. modelled gridded environmental variables.
While the usefulness of EIVE at the continental scale is 
evident, EIVEcan also be meaningful for local to national 
studies. Despite the fact that we found 31 EIV systems for 
this study, country-specific EIV systems are still missing for 
most European countries. For some EIV systems, such as 
Poland (Zarzycki et al. 2002) and Slovenia (Košir 1992), the 
complexity of the coding/symbology largely prevented au­
tomated use for calculation of mean indicator values and, 
thus, researchers tended to prefer EIV systems from neigh­
bouring areas. Here, EIVE offers two solutions: one can ei­
ther use the European EIVE indicators or use the regional 
EIV indicators in their harmonised and ready-to-use edi­
tions also provided in the EIVE database (Suppl. material 2).
This taxonomic “backbone” is another central feature 
of EIVE and is provided open access to facilitate further 
improvements in a well-documented manner. While the 
EIVE backbone for vascular plants is based on Euro+Med 
(2022), the most comprehensive and up-to-date Europe­
an checklist currently available, it aims to overcome some 
shortcomings of the current Euro+Med Plantbase with 
the addition of taxa that are regularly recorded by vege­
tation ecologists. The most important are (a) formal and 
informal taxa between species and genus level (aggregates 
and sections), (b) hybrids and (c) neophytes. Beyond that, 
we also aimed at solving some apparent mistakes in Eu­
ro+Med (2022), e.g. when one aggregate member was not 
assigned to an aggregate or when the typical subspecies 
(autonym) was not listed despite Euro+Med (2022) os­
tensibly considering the species as polytypic, containing 
several other subspecies. We even implemented a solution

22
for cases where the same name refers to different taxo­
nomic concepts in different EIV systems or countries, 
namely taxa of different width (see Jansen and Dengler 
2010). In fact, we now provide something that comes close 
to what Dengler et al. (2012) proposed under the name 
“EuroSL”. There have been previous attempts to address 
the multitude of different names and taxonomic concepts 
of European plants in ways that can be incorporated into 
automated workflows, e.g. in JUICE (Tichý 2002) or R. 
Most prominently, Chytrý et al. (2020) presented a system 
that allows aggregating different taxon names into higher 
units within EUNIS-ESy, an expert system for the deter­
mination of habitat types from the species composition of 
vegetation plots. This system is now increasingly applied 
in European vegetation studies, including the European 
Ellenberg-type indicator values by Tichý et al. (2023). The 
advantage of this system is that it interprets individual 
names in a national or regional context, considering how 
they were largely used in vegetation sampling. However, 
this system does not differentiate between synonyms, sub­
ordinate taxa, taxon concepts of different width, misap­
plied names and typos. In contrast, our system separates 
all these different cases and documents them. We suggest 
that it can be used in European projects independent from 
the indicator values and, in combination with the region­
ally interpreted taxon names from the EUNIS-ESy, might 
help the big European vegetation-plot databases such as 
EVA (Chytrý et al. 2016) and GrassPlot (Dengler et al. 
2018) to provide their content in a more harmonised way 
in the future. Our documented additions to Euro+Med 
(2022) are also an invitation to the team of the Euro+Med 
Plantbase to incorporate these taxa or a subset of these 
directly in future releases of their database.
Future plans for EIVE
With this publication, the first version (1.0) of the Ecolog­
ical Indicator Values for Europe is released. At the same 
time, this is the start of an open-ended, community-based 
endeavour that calls for continuous future updates. All raw 
data and derived data of EIVE are published open access 
with a CC BY 4.0 licence, while the R code is available upon 
request, meaning that everyone is free to use, modify or ex­
pand the current system as long as proper credit is given 
to this publication. We plan to launch a website to host all 
these materials, possibly within the framework of the Euro­
pean Vegetation Survey (http://euroveg.org/). While every­
body is free to develop new systems based on EIVE 1.0, we 
plan to establish a committee whose responsibility will be 
to release future official versions of EIVE. Here, we envisage 
a workflow similar to the EVC Committee (http://euroveg.
org/evc-committee) that releases official modifications of 
the EuroVegChecklist (Mucina et al. 2016) once they are 
approved by a majority (e.g. Biurrun and Willner 2020).
A first and self-evident step is to expand the current 
consensus system to additional taxonomic groups and 
additional indicators. Non-vascular taxa in the vegeta­
tion are known to often be particularly sensitive to envi­
ronmental conditions and thus suitable for bioindication 
(Cislaghi and Nimis 1997; Kirschbaum and Wirth 1997; 
Frahm 2001). Accordingly, terricolous bryophytes and 
lichens are included in several of the EIV systems used 
here (Ramensky et al. 1956; Tsyganov 1983; Ellenberg et 
al. 1991; Hill et al. 2004; Landolt et al. 2010; Didukh 2011; 
Hájek et al. 2020). In addition to these two groups, Julve 
(2020) also covers Charophyceae. Moreover, there are also 
specific EIV systems for bryophytes (Dierßen 2001; Sim­
mel et al. 2021) and lichens (Wirth 2010; Dingová Košu­
thová and Šibík 2013). Obvious candidates for additional 
ecological indicators are salinity (S) and continentality (C). 
Other potentially useful niche dimensions contained in 
one or several EIV systems and thus essentially accessible 
with our approach to derive a European consensus system 
are moisture variability (Ramensky et al. 1956; Tsyganov 
1983; Landolt et al. 2010; Didukh 2011), soil phosphorus 
(Tyler et al. 2021), heavy metals in soil (Ellenberg et al. 
1991; Landolt et al. 2010), soil humus content (Landolt et 
al. 2010), soil aeration (Landolt et al. 2010; Didukh 2011), 
air humidity (Tsyganov 1983; Didukh 2011), cryoclimate 
(Didukh 2011), snow layer duration (Odland and Munke­
jord 2008), mowing or grazing intensity (Dierschke and 
Briemle 2002; Landolt et al. 2010; Tyler et al. 2021), an­
thropogenic influence (or hemeroby) (Frank and Klotz 
1990; Landolt et al. 2010) and CSR strategy (Frank and 
Klotz 1990; Thompson et al. 1993; Landolt et al. 2010).
A second step would be to use the compositional data of 
the nearly two million vegetation plots from the European 
Vegetation Archive (EVA; Chytrý et al. 2016), combined 
with reciprocal averaging (e.g. Hill et al. 2000) or a sim­
ilar technique (Tichý et al. 2023), to increase the internal 
consistency of the current EIVE version and to add new 
taxa from EVA that are not included in any of the region­
al EIV systems. Combining EIVE with EVA would also 
allow the connection of ad hoc metrics of niche position 
and niche width to concrete statistical definitions. Further, 
other attributes of the ecological niches of species, such 
as minimum, maximum, skewness or bimodality could 
be determined systematically. It would even be possible 
to derive complete response curves for each species along 
each niche dimension, allowing for the ecological charac­
terisation of a site not by averaging the EIVs of the occur­
ring species, but by multiplying these probability curves.
While for pan-European analyses, a single set of conti­
nent-wide indicator values appears to be the most practical 
solution, it should be acknowledged that the ecological nich­
es of species do change across large geographic distances. 
Some species might change their niche position (Diekmann 
1995; Goedecke et al. 2019), while others decrease (Šilc et al. 
2014) or increase their niche width from the centre to the 
margins of their distributional range (unpubl. observ. J.D.: 
various species appear to have a wider R niche in the hemi­
boreal than in the nemoral zone). However, up to now, there 
has been only limited empirical evidence and vague theoret­
ical expectations regarding the changes of ecological niches 
of species along geographic gradients. Here, EIVE, togeth­

Vegetation Classification and Survey 
23
er with the vegetation-plot data from EVA, would offer the 
unique chance to explore how frequent such changes are, and 
whether there are prevailing patterns. Moreover, in a second 
step, one could complement the pan-European indicator 
values of EIVE with separate sets of indicator values for the 
major biogeographic regions in Europe, which then could be 
used with higher predictive power in regional studies.
In this paper, we derived a European indicator value 
system without direct link to environmental variables 
– apart from the external validation of EIVE-T values 
with GBIF data. In the future, it would be important to 
conduct such validations with measured or at least inde­
pendently modelled environmental variables for the oth­
er indicators as well. For the light indicator (L), the EVA 
database might provide suitable proxies, such as slope, 
aspect and inclination and tree and shrub layer cover (for 
a possible approach, see Tichý et al. 2023). By contrast, 
for the soil indicators, EVA lacks well-curated and read­
ily available in situ measured environmental variables, 
such as pH value, C/N ratio or average depth of the wa­
ter table. However, other vegetation-plot databases that 
are specialised in this field, such as the Ecological Con­
ditions Database (Wamelink et al. 2012) and GrassPlot 
(Dengler et al. 2018), can provide the relevant data. Here, 
one could ask whether and how species cover should be 
used in the calculation of mean indicator values of a plot: 
not at all (i.e. only presence/absence), fully (i.e. weight­
ing by % cover) or an intermediate solution (e.g. square 
root transformed cover) (Käfer and Witte 2004). Finally, 
one can test which is the best approach to include the 
now available numeric niche-width information into the 
calculation of the mean indicator values of a plot: not at 
all, using a threshold, using inverse weighting or using an 
even more sophisticated approach.
Conclusions and outlook
In terms of geographical and taxonomic coverage, as 
well as number of included source systems, EIVE 1.0 is 
the most comprehensive system of ecological indicator 
values developed so far. While it was beyond the scope 
of this paper to test its link to measured environmental 
site conditions, the high correlation of our EIVE-T val­
ues with modelled temperature conditions over the spe­
cies distribution ranges indicates the general validity of 
the approach and shows that creating a consensus system 
from many source systems can even increase their perfor­
mance. Compared to many, if not all, previous indicator 
value systems in Europe or parts of Europe, EIVE comes 
with several methodological novelties that likely will in­
crease the utility of the system: (i) consistent range of 0 
to 10 for all niche dimensions; (ii) interval (continuous) 
instead of ordinal (semi-quantitative) scaling; (iii); pro­
vision of both niche position and niche width and (iv) 
removal of logical inconsistencies, such as the fact that 
many systems assigned different M values for species that 
grow in the same habitat but have different morphology.
With these qualities, we are convinced that EIVE 1.0 
will open new analytical avenues and become an import­
ant tool for vegetation ecologists, conservation biologists, 
species distribution modellers and macroecologists work­
ing on the European vegetation and flora. The implemen­
tation of EIVE is facilitated by the fact that the system, its 
underlying data and R scripts are provided freely. EIVE is 
an open-source, community-based database that will be re­
leased with fixed version numbers following improvements 
Therefore, readers are invited to send to the lead authors in­
formation about overlooked, new or updated EIV systems 
of any taxonomic group of plants and any niche dimen­
sions, as well as any suggestions for further improvements.

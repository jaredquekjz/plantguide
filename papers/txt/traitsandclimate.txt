Plant functional traits (FTs) determine growth, reproduction and survival strategies of plants adapted
to their growth environment. Exploring global geographic patterns of FTs, their covariation and their
relationships to climate are necessary steps towards better-founded predictions of how global
environmental change will affect ecosystem composition. We compile an extensive global dataset for
16 FTs and characterise trait-trait and trait-climate relationships separately within non-woody, woody
deciduous and woody evergreen plant groups, using multivariate analysis and generalised additive
models (GAMs). Among the six major FTs considered, two dominant trait dimensions—representing
plant size and the leaf economics spectrum (LES) respectively—are identiﬁed within all three groups.
Size traits (plant height, diaspore mass) however are generally higher in warmer climates, while LES
traits (leaf mass and nitrogen per area) are higher in drier climates. Larger leaves are associated
principally with warmer winters in woody evergreens, but with wetter climates in non-woody plants.
GAM-simulated global patterns for all 16 FTs explain up to three-quarters of global trait variation.
Global maps obtained by upscaling GAMs are broadly in agreement with iNaturalist citizen-science FT
data. This analysis contributes to the foundations for global trait-based ecosystem modelling by
demonstrating universal relationships between FTs and climate.
As primary producers, land plants regulate carbon and nitrogen cycling in
ecosystems and determine their productivity1–3. Functional traits (FTs)—
morphological, physiological, and phenological characteristics of individual
plants4—determine plant growth, reproduction, and survival strategies by
inﬂuencing life-history processes (e.g., seed traits), resource uptake and
utilisation (e.g., leaf nutrient contents), and responses to environmental
changeanddisturbances (e.g.,leaftraitsand plantheight)4–6.FTsthusreﬂect
the diverse ecological strategies of plants, which inﬂuence plant community
assembly and thereby biodiversity and function5,7–9.
FTs have been found to covary along a limited number of
dimensions4,10. FTs that vary together at species level might, in principle,
share genetic controls, or depend on trade-offs representing alternative
ecological strategies10. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) is one well-
known axis of trait covariation that embodies a trade-off between resource
acquisitionandconservation11.Díazandcolleagues12 summarised the global
spectrum of plant form and function based on six major FTs that are critical
for the growth, survival, and reproduction of species. They identiﬁed two
orthogonal dimensions of trait covariation: one corresponding to the size of
whole plants and plant organs, the other to the LES12. These two trait
dimensionsareuniversal,existingeveninecosystemswithextremeclimates,
such as tundra13; at both species and community scales9,14; and within
plant groups, e.g., trees15. Different ecological strategies can facilitate the
coexistence of species (and their FTs) within communities9. At the com-
munity level, covarying FTs tend to perform interrelated functions2,16–18.
Wright et al.16 observed that wood density and leaf size are negatively
correlated in neotropical forests. Lower wood density related to
higher water conductivity per unit sapwood area and larger leaf area
associated with potentially higher photosynthetic rate but also higher
evapotranspiration. These two traits are thus interconnected through the
hydraulic system governing water transport and its trade-off with photo-
synthetic efﬁciency16. Quantifying the covariation of FTs and their controls
is necessary for a full understanding of how the diversity of plants translates
into
community
composition,
productivity,
and
adaptations
to
environment10.
Although the two dimensions of trait variation identiﬁed in ref. 12
are universal, the prevalence of speciﬁc FTs varies along environmental
gradients2,19: different combinations of FTs are selected for by environ-
mental conditions5,14,20, so climate change is expected to bring about shifts
in species composition determined by their FTs, such as migration and
extinction of needle-leaved trees in part of North America since the last

glacial maximum21. In order to predict such shifts, it is essential to
understand global trait-climate relationships2,21. But there is no
comprehensive global map of trait measurements22. The models used
most widely to investigate climate change effects on ecosystems are
Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). These typically
compress functional diversity into a small (about 5–15) number of
plant functional types (PFTs)22,23, which are assigned ﬁxed trait
values. Substantial, observed variability within PFTs is thereby
lost24,25. Moreover, as past and future climates may have no analogues
in present climate conditions, it is likely that this approach misses
potential trait variation and trait combinations within PFTs24,26,27. A
better approach to estimating trait values on a global scale is needed
to overcome the limitations of PFT-based modelling. Although
satellite remote-sensing offers potential to directly map plant traits at
large scales28–30, this approach can only retrieve a limited set of traits
from leaves and upper canopies, with moderate accuracy28. In addi-
tion, statistical upscaling and machine learning approaches based on
relationships between FTs and environmental factors have recently
been used to produce global maps for a few (mainly leaf)
FTs2,3,25,29,31–34. A recently published work simulated global maps of
three leaf traits via optimality models based on eco-evolutionary
optimality theory35. However, the various published global trait maps
do not always show consistent global patterns, reﬂecting differences
in data sources and upscaling methods35,36.
Newly published data and computational resources should facilitate
global-scaleresearchonFTs.ThesPlotOpendataset37,38,acuratedsubsetofa
large globally distributed set of vegetation plots,provides plot-level trait data
(as community-weighted means, CWMs) for 18 FTs. These CWMs were
calculated from trait data in the TRY database39 and the relative abundances
of each taxon within each plot38. Díaz et al.40 recentlypublished an enhanced
species-level trait dataset containing the species-mean values of the six
major FTs deﬁning the primary axes of trait covariation in the global
spectrum of plant form and function as deﬁned in ref. 12 Global trait
patterns have also beenmapped bycomplementing plantobservations from
the

project

with
measurements
from TRY41.
A study of the geographical patterns of six FTs across North and South
America found that trait-climate relationships differ overall between woody
and herbaceous plants, including different climate predictors and different
response shapes of FTs along climatic gradients42. Previous studies have also
found that woody evergreen plants tend to have thicker and longer-lived
leavespoleward,whilewoodydeciduousplantsshowtheoppositepattern43,44.
A recently developed theory explains this divergence of latitudinal trends45.
According to the theory, leaves maximise the average net carbon gain over
their life cycle. The different relationships between leaf mass per area (LMA)
and environmental factors in deciduous and evergreen woody plants then
arise because the life cycle of deciduous leaves, unlike that of evergreen leaves,
is tied to the annual cycle45. It is, therefore, appropriate to analyze non-woody
plants, woody deciduous plants, and woody evergreen plants as separate
groups with potentially distinct trait-environment relationships.
We compiled a global dataset for 16 FTs (Table 1), including
42,676 plant taxa from 77,074 natural vegetation plots based on the
sPlotOpen dataset38 and the enhanced species-level trait dataset of
ref. 40. All FTs in our dataset have plot-level means for each plot; six
also have species-level means. We refer to these six as ‘major FTs’ as
they also form the global spectrum of plant form and function. Plant
taxa were grouped into non-woody, woody deciduous and woody
evergreen categories according to their life form and leaf phenology.
We analysed trait covariation and characterised trait-climate corre-
lations within each category for the six major FTs. For all FTs, we
ﬁtted generalised additive models (GAMs) for their relationships to
three bioclimatic variables. Then we simulated global patterns for
each FT at 0.1° spatial resolution, based on climate data and remotely
sensed global fractional cover of the three plant groups. Finally, we
compared our global maps for the 16 FTs against the iNaturalist
maps41 at 2° spatial resolution.

FTs within the non-woody, woody deciduous and woody evergreen groups.
Patterns of covariation were summarised by Principal Component Analysis
(PCA). The ﬁrst three PCA axes together captured 76% of trait variation in
non-woody taxa, 88% in woody deciduous taxa and 84% in woody ever-
greentaxa (Fig. 1a–c,Table S6).Two orthogonaldimensionsemerged forall
groups. One dimension, represented by height (H) and diaspore mass
(DM), represents overall plant size—from short plants with light diaspores
to tall plants with heavy diaspores. The other, represented by LMA and leaf
nitrogen per unit area (Narea), reﬂects the LES11 and the predominant
inﬂuence of LMA on Narea
46,47. Leaf area (LA) tended to covary with plant
size,whilebeingapproximatelyorthogonaltotheLES.Stem-speciﬁcdensity
(SSD) showed the opposite direction to the other traits along axis 3 of PCA.
SSD in non-woody plants was strongly correlated with LMA and Narea
(Fig.1a). SSDinwoodyevergreenplants wasmore correlated with plantsize
(Fig. 1c), while SSD in woody deciduous plants showed an intermediate
pattern (Fig. 1b).
Relationships between traits and climate
We calculated three bioclimatic variables for each plot (Fig. S2), which
represent the three major independent climatic controls on the global
geographic distribution of vegetation physiognomy48.49,50 and therefore
likely also the global distribution of key plant traits48 (see Methods).
The three bioclimatic variables are: mean growing-season temperature
(MGST, °C, representing summer warmth), mean temperature of the
coldest month (MTCO, °C, representing winter cold), and the log-
transformed moisture index (ln MI, unitless, representing plant-available
moisture: see Methods). We subsequently conducted a Redundancy Ana-
lysis (RDA) to describe the extent to which the six major FTs covary with
these bioclimatic variables. The ﬁrst three constrained RDA axes accounted
for9%,20%and32%oftotaltraitvariationinnon-woody,woodydeciduous
and woody evergreen plants, respectively (Fig. 1d–f, Table S7). These three
axes revealed substantially the same combinations of plant size and LES
traits as were shown in the PCA, but further illustrated their relationships
with bioclimate. Along the three axes (Fig. 1d–f), plant height and diaspore
mass increased with the growing-season temperature (MGST) within all
groups, and LMA and Narea decreased with increasing moisture (ln MI)
within all groups. Plant size traits were positively correlated with winter cold
(MTCO) on the ﬁrst two axes, but they were negatively correlated on the
third axis. However, LA behaved differently, covarying with ln MI in non-
woody plants but with temperature variables in woody plants. The residual
or unconstrained RDA axes (Fig. S6) approximately replicate the PCA axes,
indicating that much trait variation along the main axes identiﬁed in ref. 12
persists even after climatic inﬂuences have been taken into account. How-
ever, a strong correlation between SSD and plant size traits in woody
evergreen plants disappeared (Fig. S6c).
We used GAMs to quantify relationships between each major FT and
bioclimatic variables in more detail, which allowed us to ﬁt more complex
surfaces and to distinguish growing season from cold-month temperature
effects (Figs. 2–3). We calculated the relative importance values of expla-
natory variables (Fig. 2) in GAMs to quantify the individual contribution of
three bioclimatic variables to the major FTs. These values measure the
average percentage contribution of each variable in turn to the ﬁt of the
models based on all three variables. Across all plant groups H variation was
dominated by growing-season temperature, and LMA and Narea variation
by moisture availability (with an additional inﬂuence of growing-season
temperature on LMA in non-woody plants). DM variation was dominated
by moisture availability in non-woody plants but by growing-season tem-
perature (with an additional inﬂuence of winter temperature) in woody
deciduous plants. By contrast, variation in SSD and LA showed similar
controls in non-woody and woody deciduous plants (dominated by

Six major traits are leaf area (LA, mm2), leaf mass per unit area (LMA, kg/m2), leaf

moistureavailabilityandgrowing-seasontemperatureforSSDandmoisture
availability for LA), but a different type of control—dominated by growing-
season and winter temperatures—for woody evergreen plants.
We visualised the trait distributions in the global climate space
deﬁned by three bioclimatic variables for each of the six major FTs
(Fig. 3, S8). This allowed for a more intuitive comparison of trait-
climate relationships among the FTs and three plant groups. FTs
related to the same principal axis of trait variation presented similar
distribution patterns in the global climate space. However, the
GAMs reveal many more subtle distinctions. For example, among
FTs related to the LES, Fig. 3b, e, h shows that LMA in all plant
groups increases towards drier climates—but LMA in non-woody
plants tends to decrease with growing-season temperature in climates
with cold winters (MTCO ≤−2 °C in Fig. 3b). LMA in woody
plants is less sensitive to temperature (Fig. 3e, h); however woody
deciduous plants show highest LMA in climates with warmer winters
(MTCO ≥10 °C in Fig. 3e), while woody evergreen plants show
highest LMA in climates with colder winters (MTCO ≤−2 °C in
Fig. 3h). Among FTs representing plant size (Fig. 3c, f, i), H is
greatest in climates that are both wet (ln MI > 1) and warm
(MGST > 15 °C, MTCO ≥10 °C) within all groups.
LA showed a general pattern of increase with moisture within all three
plant groups (Fig. 3a, d, g), but LA was less sensitive to moisture in woody
plants(Fig.3d,g)comparedtonon-woodyplants(Fig.3a;alsoconﬁrmedby
Fig.1d–f).Amongwoodyevergreens(Fig.3g),thelargestleavesarefound in
wet climates with warm winters (MTCO > 10 °C) as well as warm summers
(MGST > 15 °C). Consistent with their habit, woody deciduous (Fig. 3d)
and non-woody plants (Fig. 3a) do not show the same strong sensitivity of
LA to cold winters.
Global maps for the six major traits
For each of the three plant groups, we upscaled the GAMs based on three
bioclimatic variables to generate global distribution maps for the six major
FTs at 0.1° spatial resolution, separately. The separate trait maps for each
plant group are shown in Fig. S9.
Global maps for all traits
In order to predict global patterns for all 16 FTs having plot-level mean
values (CWMs) in the sPlotOpen dataset38, we ﬁtted new GAMs based on
the same three bioclimatic variables, combined with the (remotely sensed)
fractional cover of the three plant groups as additional predictors. All FTs
were natural-log transformed prior to the analyses. These GAMs explained
up to 77% of the global variation of plot-level mean trait values, with a
median adjusted R2 of 52% (average median calculated from 54% and 49%)
over all 16 FTs. Best ﬁts (Radj
2 ≥49%) were obtained for the following nine
FTs: H (77%), SSD (68%), DM (64%), SCD (61%), LMA (57%), LA (56%),
LFM(55%),Cmass(54%)andNarea(49%)(seeTableS11forasummary).We
created global trait maps for all 16 FTs based on these GAMs at 0.1° spatial
resolution (Fig. 4; see Fig. S12 for all 16 FTs). H, LA, and LFM (Fig. 4a–c)
were predicted to be higher in tropical regions and warm and humid
environments,withlowervaluesfound incoldhigh-latituderegionsanddry
temperate environments. The global distribution of LMA (Fig. 4d) might be
related to the joint effects of global patterns of LA (Fig. 4b) and LFM
(Fig. 4c). Plants with higher LMA were predicted to inhabit tropical regions
and drier environments, while plants with lower LMA mainly appeared in
humid northern temperate regions. Tropical zones subject to high
moisture stress harbour species with higher SSD but lower SCD (Fig. 4e–f).
However, plants in humid northern temperate regions and boreal forests
had relatively higher valuesof SCD and lowerSSD (Fig. 4e–f). Although FTs
within the same trait dimension did not show identical global patterns, their
maximum values tended to occur under similar environmental conditions.
Like high-LMA plants (Fig. 4d), plants with higher Narea (Fig. 4g) were
generally favoured in hot and dry environments, supporting earlier
ﬁndings51–53. DM (Fig. 4h) was predicted to be notably high in equatorial
regions and warm and humid temperate regions with hot summers, coin-
ciding with H (Fig. 4a). Cmass showed little variation across the globe
(Fig. 4i). It was found to be slightly lower in deserts and arid temperate
regions.
Comparison to iNaturalist data
Independent global trait maps41 generated by linking plant observations
from the iNaturalist citizen-science project to trait measurements from the
TRYdatabase were usedasa benchmarkforourGAM-based predictions,as
the iNaturalist data included all 16 FTs considered in our study. We eval-
uated the pixel-by-pixel agreement between our GAM-predicted maps with
the iNaturalist maps at 2° resolution, chosen because some FTs presented
the highest correlations between sPlotOpen and iNaturalist at this
spatial scale41.

The highest R2 and median R2 of linear regressions between our GAM-
derived maps and the iNaturalist maps, overall 16 FTs, were 64% and 15%.
Figure 5 shows nine FTs that present better agreement than the remaining
FTs (R2 ≥13% and slope >0.5 and <2): SCD, LA, LFM, SSD, δ15N, H, Narea,
LMA, and DM (see Table S13 for more information).
The slope of the linear regression also indicates the direction in which
the GAM-predicted values deviate from the iNaturalist gridded values.
According to Fig. 5, GAMs tended to estimate higher LMA and lower LA
and Narea in comparison to the iNaturalist data. GAM tended to over-
estimate SSD at lower values and underestimate SSD at higher values
compared with the iNaturalist data. For larger values, GAMs predicted
higher H and DM but predicted lower LFM, SCD and δ15N than the iNa-
turalist data.
Discussion
Ecological strategies reﬂected by trait-trait and trait-climate
relationships
Analysing six major FTs in non-woody, woody deciduous and woody
evergreenplantsseparately,wefoundthatthetwoorthogonaldimensionsof
covariation in plant size traits (H–DM) and LES traits (LMA–Narea), ﬁrst
identiﬁed by Díaz and colleagues12, also apply within each of the three plant
groups (Fig. 1a–c). Although Díaz et al.12 showed that non-woody and
woodyplantsformtwoalmostdisjuncthotspotsalongtheH–DMaxis42,our
study shows nonetheless that the covariation of H and DM follows almost
the same pattern within the non-woody and woody taxon groups
(Fig. 1a–c). FTs from the same dimensions of trait covariation tended to be
inﬂuenced by climate in similar ways (Figs. 1–3 and S8). H relates to light

ter,warmerandmoreproductivesites),plantsmakemorecarbonproﬁtthat
can be invested in stems and also used for seed production. Consequently,
they can grow taller to have greater access to light, and produce larger seeds,
promoting both a strong competitive status and a high survival
probability2,54–57.
LMA
and
Narea
represents

strategies11,12. LMA reﬂects a trade-off between the amount of carbon
invested in leaves and their lifespan58. Narea has been considered as the sum
of a metabolic component and a structural component, the former pro-
portional to photosynthetic capacity, the latterto LMA46,47. Leaves with high
LMA and Narea are favoured in hot and dry climates because this combi-
nation can conserve water to allow the plants to maintain a relatively high
photosynthetic rate in the face of increased evapotranspiration51–53.
Our analysis also revealed a differentiation in trait combinations
among the three plant groups, speciﬁcally in the covariation of SSD with
other FTs. SSD in non-woody plants was strongly correlated with LES traits
(Fig. 1a). SSD in woody deciduous plants was relatively independent
(Fig. 1b), while SSD in woody evergreen plants was more correlated with
plant size traits (Fig. 1c). This novel ﬁnding is explicable in adaptive terms.
In dry climates, some herbaceous and succulent plants (typically with low
SSD) can ﬁx CO2 though their green stems, reducing water loss from the
leaves and providing an extra source of carbon59–61. The variation of SSD did
notshowstrongercorrelationwithasingleofthetwomajortraitdimensions
in the global spectrum of plant form and function12. Previous studies were
either conducted on global vascular plants12 or analysed trait data at the
communitylevelbyusingcommunity-weightedmeans9,14.Thesestudiesdid
not identify the functional differences among the non-woody, woody
deciduous and woody evergreen plants, consequently failing to detect the
distinctive trait combinations associated with SSD. We also extracted pixel
values from the GAM-basedglobal maps of the six major traits in each plant
group and performed PCA and RDA on them to test these observed trait
combinations were still present in the predicted trait values (Fig. S16). The
distinct patterns of SSD among the three plant groups were not evident in
the predicted trait values—particularly in non-woody plants, where the
previously strong correlation between SSD and LES traits was now absent
(Fig. S16a). Trait data used in original PCA and RDA were calculated from
thedatabaseofDíazetal.40(seeMethods)inwhichobservedrecordsforSSD
are available only for a few non-woody species; missing values of SSD were
imputed via leaf dry matter content (LDMC)40, which was found to be
closely related to both LMA and Narea
9: perhaps accounting for the strong
correlation between (LDMC-derived) SSD and the LES traits.
Correlations between the six major FTs and the three bioclimatic
variablesvariedamongnon-woody,woodydeciduousandwoodyevergreen
plants. The relative importance of predictors was different among the
groups, as were patterns of trait distribution in climate space (Figs. 1–3 and
S8).Bioclimaticvariablesexplainedmoretraitvarianceforwoodythannon-
woody plants (Fig. 1d–f, Table S7). One explanation is that woody plants
have permanent organs that must endure climatic conditions year-round
over the years. In addition, short-stature non-woody plants are closer to the
ground and experience different physical conditions compared with tall-
statured woodyplants42; therefore, the microclimate of non-woody plants in
the understorey cannot be directly represented by macroclimate variables42.
Different trait-climate correlations among the three plant groups are
associatedwiththeirlife-historystrategies.Fornon-woodyplants,LMAwas
less constrained by plant-available moisture (represented by ln MI) than
woody plants (Fig. 2), and their DM showed little correlation with all three
bioclimatic variables (Figs. 2–3 and S8). Such discrepancies may arise
because non-woody species tend to occupy smaller, more specialised and
diverse niches than woody species42,62. Once climatic conditions are outside
their tolerance, they undergo dieback63. Therefore, they must grow quickly
and reproduce efﬁciently within the favourable portion of a short lifespan.
Such a strategy precludes tall stature64, supports lower LMA leaves (thus
lower leaf Narea) even in drier climates in order to maintain high photo-
synthetic and respiration rates63, and supports the production of copious
small seeds to maximise ﬁtness under high resource availability57,65,66. The
short lifespan of many non-woody plants also represents an adaptive

freezes64.
Tall woody plants, on the other hand, are successful competitors for
light, persisting across years in changing environments64,65. However,
deciduous and evergreen woody plants also adopt different ecological
strategies.WefoundthatLEStraits(LMA–Narea)ofwoodydeciduousplants
were insensitive to growing-season temperature (MGST) but were strongly
affected by plant-available moisture (ln MI) and winter temperature
(MTCO) (Fig. 3 and S8). This distinction corresponds to the fact that
deciduous plants shed their leaves in response to dry or cold conditions67,68.
As a result, the leaf life cycle of woody deciduous species is tied to the
growing season45; their lower LMA (and thus lower Narea) represents an
adaptationtoashortlifespan42,45.Incontrast,woodyevergreenplants,which
need to maintain leaves and vascular networks over successive seasons64,
typically adopt more conservative nutrient-use strategies (higher LMA and

Narea) and may require greater protection against drought and/or frost
damage11,13,14.
LA in woody plants was positively correlated with winter temperature
(MTCO) (Fig. 3), but the relative importance of winter cold for LA in
evergreenplantswashigherthanthatindeciduousplants(Fig.2).Evergreen
woodyplants with smallleaves (low LA) are better adaptedto harsh winters.
Larger leaves are more prone to frost damage because of their thicker
insulating boundary layers of still air that slow sensible heat exchanges with
their surroundings69. This means that their ability of heat uptake from their
surroundings to compensate for the energy lost to the night-time sky is
diminished, leaving them vulnerable to frost69. Although all three plant
groups showed the highest SSD at the same moisture level, the SSD in
evergreen plants was higher (Fig. S8) and was less controlled by moisture
(Fig. 2) than that of the other two groups. SSD reﬂects wood density and is
related to drought-tolerance of plants70. Evergreen trees with higher wood
density are less vulnerable to drought-induced embolism than co-existing
drought-deciduous trees with lower wood density in arid environments71.
The hydraulic architecture of high-SSD evergreen woody plants, including
ﬁbres and thick-walled vessels, allows them to maintain water transport to
the canopy under greater xylem pressure caused by water shortage and to
continue growing in seasonally dry climates70,71.
Evaluations of global trait maps
Mindful of potential differences in trait-climate correlations among non-
woody, woody deciduous and woody evergreen plants, as shown for the six
major FTs, we ﬁtted a set of GAMs that included fractional abundances of
these groups to simulate global patterns of all 16 FTs. These GAMs predicted
up to 77% of variation in our global data sample correctly (Table S11). We
evaluated the agreement of our GAM-predicted maps with the iNaturalist
maps41. The iNaturalist41 data represents a large and independent trait dataset
based on citizen-science plant observations and trait measurements from the
TRY database39. The data included all 16 FTs considered in our study. Pre-
viously published global trait maps generated by statistical modelling or
machine learning methods2,3,25,29,31–34 have only simulated global patterns for a
subset of FTs we studied here; moreover, these maps show large differences in
data sources, methodology and results35,36. We also compared the general
patternsofglobaltraitmapsgeneratedhereinwiththosefromotherpublished
products for six major traits and LDMC. The predictability of our GAMs for
the common six major traits was signiﬁcantly stronger than models of other
products (Table S12). Almost all six major traits presented similar global
spatial patterns to that of previous studies. Nevertheless, regional differences
emerged between our results and other products. For example, Narea values in
CentralAfricawereatintermediatelevelinourGAM-predictedmap(Fig.4g),
contrastingwiththerelativelylowestvaluesobservedinthetheory-basedmap
by Dong et al.35; plant height (H) was predicted to be higher in Europe in this
study compared to Schiller et al.’s predictions33. The predictability of GAM of
this study for LDMC was relatively weaker (Radj
2 = 0.39, Table S12) and the
global pattern of LDMC simulated in this study suggested signiﬁcant devia-
tion from the previous remote-sensing-based projections29.
Overall,ourGAM-predictedmapsshowedvariablystrongcorrelations
withtheiNaturalistmaps,withthehighest R2of64%butamedianR2ofonly
15% (Table S13). They showed varying degrees of overestimation or
underestimation compared to the iNaturalist maps (Fig. S13). We ﬁrst
checked which regions across the globe showed overestimation and
underestimation of our predicted FTs compared to iNaturalist data
(Fig. S14). Our GAMs tended to predict higher LMA, DM and SSD and
lower SCD than iNaturalist data in the northern temperate regions, but
lower Narea, SSD and LFM than iNaturalist data in southern tropical and
temperate regions. H was overestimated globally by the GAM compared to
iNaturalist, especially in the northern high latitudes.
Plot-level mean values of 16 FTs in our study were obtained from the
sPlotOpendataset. In principle, the above disagreements may arise from the
respective sampling biases of iNaturalist and sPlotOpen. The iNaturalist
contributors are by no means evenly sampled across growth forms (tree/
shrub/herb)41, while the sPlotOpen data cover a relatively small portion of
the global climate space. The coverage of growth formin each grid cell of the
iNaturalist maps indicated a bias towards herbaceous plants in the northern
regions, and towards woody plants further south. This is because plant
observations in iNaturalist are largely governed by individual decisions33,41
and are a priori likely to underrepresent grasses41, for example. The data are
nonetheless of value because of their independence from other data sources.
The sPlotOpen dataset has both commonalities and disagreements with the
iNaturalist data41. sPlotOpen is an aggregation of vegetation plots from
various studies with speciﬁc and distinct research aims across global eco-
systems that do not share the same criteria in the sampling approach, which
may also lead to biases in this dataset37,38. Large areas of the globe, including
Canada,Central South America,CentralAfrica,CentralAsia, East Asia,and
Siberia, are undersampled (Fig. S4). This sampling bias affects the robust-
ness of prediction of trait distribution for large areas. Furthermore, while
sPlotOpen provides plot-level means for each trait, not all species within
every vegetation plot have been recorded. 16.5% of plots have all vascular
plant records, plant records of 72.1% plots are not speciﬁed, and the
remaining 11.4% of plots have only certain species records (e.g., only woody
plants or dominant plants) in the ﬁnal plot-level mean trait dataset used in
this study (Table S2). As a result, plot-level trait means sampled for speciﬁc
target plant in a vegetation plot cannot accurately reﬂectthe CWMs of traits
within the corresponding regions.
The selection of predictor variables in GAMs might contribute to the
disagreement between the two set of global trait maps. Our study applied a
consistent set of three bioclimatic variables to each FT, thereby preserving
model simplicity and providing a consistent baseline for comparison. The
three selected variables reﬂect three most important aspects of climate that
govern plant distributions, i.e., winter cold, summer warmth and moisture
availability48,49,50. These three variables effectively explained global patterns
of different FTs and sufﬁciently distinguished the main differences in trait-
climate relationships among three plant groups. However, some FTs can be
inﬂuenced by other factors in addition to the bioclimatic variables used in
this study. Soil fertility factors and soil age have been indicated to correlate
with leaf nutrient traits3,14,72–74. Land use and disturbance regimes can also
affect trait-environment relationships25,32,75. Disturbance by ﬁre or grazing
and browsing by megaherbivores have strong effects on traits of seed dis-
persal and plant regeneration25. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is also an
important driver of some FTs, directly affecting the growth rates and pro-
ductivity of plants25,76. Evolutionary history effects (represented by phylo-
geny) were reported to explain on average more than two-thirds of the
variability of the foliar concentrations of N, P and K3.
The scale at which trait variation occurs may be another reason for
the lower correlations between GAM maps and the iNaturalist data for
some FTs. Some FTs lack macroecological patterns, such as Cmass, which
showed little variation on a global scale (Fig. 4i). In addition, our
community-level prediction ignores intraspeciﬁc trait variation. A global
meta-analysis based on 36 plant traits indicated that traits can vary sub-
stantially among individuals within species, and that the relative amount of
intraspeciﬁc trait variation does not vary with plant growth forms or
climate77.
This study has characterised universal relationships among FTs and
between FTs and climates within non-woody, woody deciduous and woody
evergreen plants, and simulated global patterns of FTs based on these
relationships. It has highlighted certain key differences between the three
plant groups in their ecological strategies as represented by trait-climate
correlations, indicating that it is useful to differentiate between non-woody,
woody deciduous and woody evergreen plants in large-scale, trait-based
studies.Based onthreebioclimaticvariablesand global vegetationcoverand
their interaction effects, we can explain up to three-quarters (on average
about a half) of global variation of community-weighted means for all
16 FTs. By generating global maps for all 16 FTs at 0.1° resolution, we have
provided the most comprehensive set of trait maps based on statistical
upscaling approach to date.

Plant functional traits and three plant groups
The FT data were collected from the sPlotOpen dataset38 and the enhanced
species-level trait dataset of Díaz et al.40 (see Table 1).
The sPlotOpen dataset provides plot-level trait means (as community-
weighted means, CWMs) of 18 FTs, as well as plant taxa within each
vegetation plot and their relative abundances38. We calculated the LMA and
area-based leaf phosphorus content (Parea) from speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and
mass-based leaf phosphorus content (Pmass) in the sPlotOpen dataset
according to Eqs. (1) and (2). After removing some redundant traits, such as
SLA, Pmass, mass-based leaf nitrogen content (Nmass) and leaf N:P ratio
(which can be directly calculated from Narea and Parea), 16 FTs were selected
for analysis (Table 1). All 16 FTs were natural-log transformed before
analysis. Here we focus on Narea and Parea, because Osnas etal.78 showed that
leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents are approximately distributed pro-
portional to leaf area rather than mass. Narea and Parea were found to be
proportionaltoLMAandphotosyntheticcapacityofplants46,47,79.BothLMA
and photosynthetic capacity are quantitatively predictable from climate45,79,
which may lead to potentially high predictability of Narea and Parea from
climates. In contrast, values of Nmass and Pmass may be more conservative
under climate change. We also conducted the following analyses on Nmass
and Pmass (see Supplementary Information SI 2 for details) and found that
climate is not good predictor of their distributions.

All plant taxa within each vegetation plot in the sPlotOpen data were
extracted. We collected plant information including woodiness, plant
growth form and leaf phenology for each taxon from public databases,
regional ﬂoras, and published papers (see Data availability for relevant
references of plant information). Each plant taxon was then assigned to a
growth form according to the collected plant information to create a plant
growth form dataset. There are 42,676 unique taxa in the dataset. Table S3
presents16 growth forms intotal and the proportionofeach growth formin
the plant growth form dataset.
We classiﬁed all taxa as non-woody, woody deciduous or woody
evergreen according to their growth forms. Some minority growth forms,
including ferns, palms, cycads, bamboos, cacti and succulents, were omitted
from subsequent analyses. We then used the relative coverage of each taxon
within a vegetation plot provided by the sPlotOpen data and the assigned
probability of each taxon being in each plant group (Table S4) to calculate
the relative coverage of each of the three plant groups within a plot. The
calculation followed Eqs. (3) and (4).

The species-level trait dataset from Díaz et al.40 provides species-
mean values of six major FTs that constitute the global spectrum of plant
form and function12. We converted Nmass to area-based leaf nitrogen
content (Narea) based on the raw data, according to the Eq. (5). After
merging this species-level trait dataset with the sPlotOpen dataset and the
plant growth form dataset, a total of 35,773 common species were
explicitly classiﬁed into non-woody, woody deciduous and woody ever-
green groups. The scientiﬁc names of all taxa from different datasets were
aligned before integration by using Taxonomic Name Resolution Service
V5.2 (TNRS, https://tnrs.biendata.org/)80. We then calculated CWMs for
the six major FTs of each of the three plant groups within each vegetation
plot based on their species-level means and the relative coverage of each
plant group. These CWMs were then natural-log transformed prior to
further analyses. All data manipulations and following analyses were
conducted in R v4.2.2 (https://www.r-project.org/)81.

Bioclimatic variables
Three bioclimatic variables were selected48,49,50 (Fig. S2): (i) moisture index
(MI, unitless) representing plant-available moisture—the natural-log
transformed MI (ln MI) was used in the analysis to emphasise differences
at the dry end of the moisture range82; (ii) mean temperature of the coldest
month (MTCO, °C) representing winter cold; (iii) mean growing-season
temperature (MGST, °C) representing summer warmth. The three selected
variables correspond to the three recognised climatic dimensions that reg-
ulate global geographic distribution of vegetation48,49,50. They control the
plant distribution limits by affecting the plant attributes that determine
physiological processes and adaptive strategies, such as life form, leaf phe-
nology, leaf size and stomatal conductance48,49,50. Hence, the distribution of
some key plant traits is likely to be a function of these bioclimatic variables,
and thus may be quantitatively predicted by these variables48.
We collected gridded climatological data for further calculations,
with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second (ca 0.01°). Growing degree days
(heat sum) above 0 °C (GDD0, °C), number of growing degree days above
a base level of 0 °C (NGD0, number of days), monthly averaged mean
daily air temperature (tas, K/10) and mean monthly precipitation
amount (pr, kg m–2 month–1/100) were obtained from CHELSA V2.1
(https://chelsa-climate.org/)83,84, covering the period from 1981 to 2010.
Downward total shortwave solar radiation data accumulated over the
month (srad, kJ m–2) were downloaded from the CHELSA V1.2 (https://
chelsa-climate.org/)83,84, covering the period from 1979 to 2013. Global
elevation derived from the SRTM elevation data (elev, m) was acquired
from WorldClim v.2.1 (https://www.worldclim.org/)85.
We used the Simple Process-Led Algorithms for Simulating Habitats
(SPLASH) model86,87 with climatic variables as inputs to calculate the mean
monthly potential evapotranspiration (PET, mm). We extracted the cli-
matic values for each vegetation plot according to its longitude and latitude.
The ‘splash.point()’ function in R rsplash package86,87 was applied to cal-
culatethePETofeachplot.Wethendecreasedtheresolutionofrawclimatic
raster data from 0.01° to 0.1° and ﬁtted them into the SPLASH model by
‘splash.grid()’ function in R rsplash package86,87 to calculate the global PET.
Three bioclimatic variables (Fig. S2) were then calculated as follows:

Vegetation coverage
We checked the ‘naturalness’ of each vegetation plot in our trait dataset
against the global map of land cover provided by the ESA CCI-LC database
(https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/?q=node/164)88 at 300 m spatial reso-
lutionin2010.Forplotsbelongingtoalltypesofcroplands,urbanareas,bare
areas, water bodies and permanent snow and ice in the ESA CCI-LC
database, we deﬁned them as ‘unnatural vegetation’ and removed those
plots from the trait dataset used for data analysis. After matching the trait
datasetwithbioclimatedata,77,074naturalvegetationplotsremainedinthe
ﬁnal dataset for our study.
The ESA CCI-LC global land cover data were also used to calculate
the global fractional cover of three plant groups. The spatial resolution of
therawlandcoverrasterwasdecreasedfrom300 mto0.1°tomatchwiththe
resolution of bioclimate raster for further analyses. This ESA CCI-LC
dataset contains 23 classes including 38 sub-classes of global land cover
(Table S5). We ﬁrst selected the vegetation plots that contained records of
‘all vascular plants’ in our trait dataset (12,743 plots in total). We then
identiﬁed the land cover class and sub-class of each of these vegetation plots
according to the ESA CCI-LC maps at original 300 m resolution and
accordinglycalculatedthemedianrelativecoverofthethreeplantgroupsfor
each sub-class. The coverages of three plant groups of artiﬁcial ecosystems
and non-natural and non-terrestrial vegetations were set to be NA. We then
replaced grid values representing sub-classes of global land cover in the ESA
CCI-LC maps with the median relative cover of the three plant groups
within each sub-class and calculated the average values at 0.1° resolution to
produce the global fractional cover of the three plant groups.
Multivariate analysis
The natural-log transformed CWMs of six major FTs of each plant group
wererescaledtoameanof0andastandarddeviationof1andthensubjected
to a PCA and a Redundancy Analysis (RDA), conducted by ‘prcomp()’
functionand‘rda()’functionintheRveganpackage89,respectively.PCAwas
used to evaluate the covariation of trait combinations among six FTs in
different plant groups. RDA was applied to describe the extent to which the
variation of trait combinations (response variables) can be explained by
bioclimatic variables (explanatory variables).
Generalised additive models
Correlations between FTs and three bioclimatic variables were char-
acterised and visualised by GAMs. GAMs were ﬁtted for natural-log
transformed CWMs of six major FTs in each of the three plant groups with
three bioclimatic variables as explanatory variables, without interaction
terms, using the ‘gam()’ function in R mgcv package90. We used the RMEL
(restricted maximum likelihood) as smoothing parameter to control the
smoothness of the predictive functions. We then calculated the relative
importance of each bioclimatic variable in the GAMs to determine which
of the predictors is moresigniﬁcantly related to the distribution of each FT.
The concurvity of three bioclimatic variables in GAMs was checked before
ﬁtting models (mean values: ln MI = 0.487 ± 0.06, MTCO = 0.651 ± 0.07,
MGST = 0.867 ± 0.02). MGST presented relatively high concurvity, which
makes it challenging to interpret the individual importance of variables in
trait prediction. Nonetheless, the overall predictive performance of the
GAMs remains robust, with the combined effect of the predictors effec-
tively capturing the variation in FTs.
We sampled the bioclimates at regular intervals from minimum to
maximum over the globe, e.g., sampling at increments of 0.05 (unitless) for
ln MI, 0.25 °C for MTCO, and 0.25 °C for MGST, to generate three sample
datasets simulating the global climate space. The sample data and GAMs
werethenusedtopredictthedistributionoftraitvaluesintheglobalclimate
spaceforeachplantgroup.Theresponsesurfacesoftraitvalues(natural-log
transformed) resulting from GAMs were presented as contours in the
three-variable climate space in the form of two-dimensional slices. Convex
hulls generated by ‘convhulln()’ function in the R geometry package91 were
usedtoavoidrepresentingpartsoftheﬁttedsurfacethatarenotconstrained
by data. For each plantgroup separately, we alsopredicted and mapped the
global distribution of natural-log transformed values of six major FTs, as
predictedbytheGAMs,basedonglobalrasterdataforthethreebioclimatic
variables at 0.1° spatial resolution.
Global trait maps and evaluation
In order to simulate global trait patterns for all plant taxa, we ﬁtted new
GAMs for all 16 FTs with natural-log transformed plot-level means
(CWMs). In the new GAMs, trait values were predicted by not only three
bioclimatic variables, but also global fractional cover of plant groups, and
interactions between each bioclimatic variable with the cover fraction of
eachplantgroup.Asthesumoftheglobalfractionalcoverforthethreeplant
groups is 1, we only considered the coverage of two of these groups (woody
deciduous and woody evergreen) when ﬁtting the new GAMs. The new
GAMs also used the RMEL as smoothing parameter and were ﬁtted using
the ‘gam()’ function in the R mgcv package90. We then generated global trait
maps for all 16 FTs at 0.1° spatial resolution.
Although using a weighted average of three maps from different plant
groups should be a more straightforward way to generate global maps, we
did not adopt this approach. This is becausesimulatingseparateglobal trait
patterns for each of the three plant groups and calculating weighted
averages of them with fractional cover of plant groups as weights would
only be applicable where traits possess species-level values. In this study,
only the six major traits are provided with species-level mean values. The
remaining traits have plot-level mean values, which are weighted averages
of trait values for all plant taxa within the plot. It is almost impossible to
predict global trait patterns for each plant group from such community-
weightedmeantraitvalues.However,usingtheGAMs,includingfractional
covers of plant groups, provides a more universal alternative approach,
which is directly applicable to plot-level means.
We tested our global trait maps based on GAMs predictions against
another set of global trait maps41 based on the combinations of citizen-
science plant observations from the iNaturalist project and trait measure-
ments from the TRY database. The iNaturalist-based maps provided all FTs
availableforthecalculationofthesame16FTsasinourstudy.Theplot-level
means of all 16 FTs in our study were taken from the sPlotOpen, and the
global trait patterns estimated by the iNaturalist tend to most strongly
resemble that of the sPlotOpen at 2° resolution41. Therefore, we aggregated
and reprojected our global trait maps according to the iNaturalist maps (2°
spatial resolution) using bilinear interpolation by ‘projectRaster()’ function
in the R raster package92. Then, we assessed the pixel-by-pixel agreement
between our trait maps and the iNaturalist trait maps by linear regression
using the ‘lm()’ function in the R stats package.

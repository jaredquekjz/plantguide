Abstract
Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting
aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody
tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant
optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications,
which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given
to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we
identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood
density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical
features, as well as clade-speciﬁc features such as secondary chemistry. We then show
how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to
ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological
setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster
around the leaf economics spectrum, a similar wood economics spectrum may be
deﬁned. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the
spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of
wood functional traits.

The arborescent life-form arose out of an evolutionary
arms race for the capture of light. By positioning leaves
above those of its neighbours, a tree is able to intercept a
large proportion of solar radiation and puts itself at
strong selective advantage (Falster & Westoby 2005).
Jostling for a larger share of resources by locating leaves
upwards on woody stems provided impetus for the
evolution of trees that today dominate several terrestrial
biomes. The woody tissues of trees and other plants
perform three important functions. They provide biome-
chanical support for the stems that suspend photosyn-
thetic tissues above the ground (Rowe & Speck 2005),
they conduct water and nutrients along the soil–plant–
atmosphere continuum (Tyree & Zimmermann 2002;
Sperry et al. 2008), and they act as a store for nutrients,
carbohydrates, defensive secondary chemical compounds,
lipids and water (Harmon et al. 1986; Kozlowski 1992).
Because wood performs more than one task, there are

and
these
demands may shift depending upon the environment.

Impressive advances have been made in understanding
plant ecological strategies by focusing on leaf traits, but less
attention has been paid to wood traits. Wright et al. (2004)
drew from a global database of leaf functional traits to show
that these traits co-vary in a way that depends little on
environmental features: short-lived leaves have low leaf
mass per unit area, high nutrient concentrations and high
photosynthetic rates per unit mass while the converse is true
of long-lived leaves. They called the manifold of traits
around which all species cluster the leaf economics
spectrum, which depicts the major trade-offs plants are
facing when they produce leaf tissue, be they defensive,
physiological or structural. Other conceptual frameworks of
plant ecological strategies have placed emphasis on both
photosynthetic and reproductive traits. Westoby et al. (2002)
argued that the leading dimensions of ecological variation
among plants include leaf traits (leaf mass per area, leaf
lifespan, leaf size), stem traits (leaf size–twig size ratios),
seed traits (seed mass, seed output) and whole-plant
morphological traits (total plant height). Wood traits were
not explicitly considered in these earlier studies, but they
have been discussed more recently (Westoby & Wright
2006).
An increased understanding of xylem function is highly
relevant to biogeochemistry and ecosystem ecology, as
plants make up over 90% of the living biomass stock, and
the carbon stored in the highly ligniﬁed cells of both living
and dead stems is a crucial component in the global carbon
cycle (Denman et al. 2007). Knowledge of the factors
limiting the decomposition of wood is critical to under-
standing whether forests are net sinks or sources of carbon.
Indeed, the reduction in woody plant cover over large
geographical areas as the result of land-use changes, ﬁre,
insect or pathogen outbreaks, releases globally signiﬁcant
quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Den-
man et al. 2007; Kurz et al. 2008). One challenge has been to
scale up from the dynamics of groups of interacting
individual trees to regional carbon budgets in terrestrial
ecosystems (Purves & Pacala 2008). Complicating this
challenge are recent ﬁndings that suggest it is essential to
have some basic information of wood properties, in
particular wood density, to obtain reliable estimates of
carbon stocks in the major terrestrial biomes (e.g. Baker
et al. 2004). Therefore, the importance of variability in wood
functional traits requires more scrutiny.
In this review, we seek to identify the leading dimensions
of ecological variation among plant traits related to wood
structure and organization (Baas et al. 2004; Wright et al.
2006a; Zanne et al. 2006; Wheeler et al. 2007) by reviewing
research on wood anatomy, biomechanics, ecophysiology
and biogeochemistry. We have collated a number of existing
databases from the plant taxonomy and wood technology
literature to explore the major axes of variation in wood
traits. We use these data to explore whether there is a wood
economics spectrum – a manifold of co-varying wood traits
around which species cluster. Four steps are needed to
deﬁne such a wood economics spectrum. First, we must
identify a set of wood traits that have important inﬂuences
on ecological processes. Second, we must check whether
these traits co-vary, and thus point to potential trade-offs.
Third, we must determine whether these co-variations are
reﬂected in allocation decisions (real trade-offs), providing a
ﬁrm basis for interpreting such a spectrum within an
economics context (costs and beneﬁts). Fourth, studies of
plant functional traits often focus on trade-offs and
correlations of traits within a given plant organ, but plants
maximize ﬁtness by making allocation decisions that
optimize growth and survival across all tissues. Thus, it
seems likely that wood traits should ultimately be integrated
with other trait spectra and these combined allocations
should lead to predictable differences in growth and
survival.
In the forthcoming sections, we explore the functional
properties of wood (Section 2); we then examine correla-
tions among wood traits and look for evidence of
coordination and trade-offs between wood traits and other
plant traits (Section 3). Armed with this knowledge we look
at the extent to which wood traits are related to emergent
demographic properties of plants: growth and mortality
(Section 4). Finally, we explore the biogeographical, evolu-
tionary (Section 5) and biogeochemical (Section 6) implica-
tions of our ﬁndings.

A. Wood density as an integrator of wood properties
Wood density, deﬁned here, is the oven-dry mass divided by
green volume. It has traditionally been regarded as a key
functional trait by ecologists. The density of woody
structures excluding open spaces in wood is c. 1.5 (Siau
1984), hence wood density is bounded by 0 and 1.5 g cm)3.
Wood density thus also describes the carbon investment or
carbon storage per unit volume of stem (see Section 5).
Wood density varies within individuals. As wood ages, the
inward part of sapwood is converted into heartwood
(duramen) through the polymerization of compounds such
as lignan, stilbene and ﬂavonoid derivatives (Hillis 1987
Schultz et al. 1995). Heartwood xylem lacks functional
conduits and parenchyma. Foresters typically measure
heartwood density, yet sapwood (xylem containing func-
tional conduits and parenchyma) densities are often signif-
icantly lower than heartwood densities (Woodcock & Shier
2002; Patin˜o et al. 2008). This pattern has been attributed to
the structural support required at different ontogenetic
stages or changes in chemical deposition in heartwood.

Furthermore, wood density varies with height within the
plant (Swenson & Enquist 2008). The wood density of roots
has not been measured as extensively as stems; however,
roots tend to have lighter wood (Pratt et al. 2007).
Given the perceived importance of wood density with
mechanical support, water transport and storage capacity of
woody tissues, we have assembled the largest compilation of
wood density data to date, encompassing 8412 taxa, 1683
genera, 191 families (for more details on database construc-
tion, see Appendix 1 in the Supplementary Online Infor-
mation). The dataset is available in the Dryad data repository
(http://datadryad.org/). In the forthcoming sections, we
will also discuss geographic, phylogenetic and ecological
patterns related to wood density.
B. Water transport in the xylem
One of the major roles of xylem in land plants is to
transport sap to the leaves and photosynthate to the plant
organs (Kozlowski 1992). This places important constraints
on the architecture of stems (Tyree & Zimmermann 2002;
Sperry et al. 2008). Vessel elements represent the most
important water conductive cell types in angiosperms
(Glossary, see Supplementary Online Information). Vessels
vary in length from a few millimetres up to several metres,
and they vary in diameter from < 20 to > 500 lm, while
cross-sectional area percentages of vessels range from 4% to
60%. The degree to which vessels are connected to each
other can inﬂuence both rates of water transport and ability
to deal with xylem dysfunction, or embolism (Fig. 1, Zanne
et al. 2006; Choat et al. 2008). In general, vessel length is
positively correlated with vessel diameter (Ewers et al. 1997;
Hacke et al. 2006). In conifers, which lack vessels, c. 95% of
the constituent cells are long, fibrous tracheids, a more
primitive cell type than vessel elements (Carlquist 2001).
Tracheids vary in length from < 1 to > 5 mm, and from
< 10 to > 50 lm in diameter. Water transport in conifers
mainly occurs via wide earlywood tracheids, and mechanical
support mainly occurs via narrow latewood tracheids. The
relative distribution of angiosperms and conifers is likely
related to differences in their wood properties (Sperry et al.
2008). For instance, it has been suggested that in lowland
tropical environments, angiosperms have out-competed
conifers because of their innovations in hydraulic transport
(Bond 1989).
At the conduit level, the efﬁciency of water transport can
be mechanistically described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equa-
tion, which relates the theoretical hydraulic conductivity K
of a conduit assuming a laminar flow (Appendix 2). The
longer and wider the conduit is the lower is its resistance to
water ﬂow. At the same time, increased conduit diameter
greatly decreases safety, especially with respect to freezing-
induced cavitation. This represents what some believe to be
an important trade-off in plant function (Baas et al. 2004).
At the whole-plant level, simple theoretical models have
been constructed to simulate how ideal plants should work.
Such models include the classic pipe model (Tyree &
Zimmermann 2002), the West–Brown–Enquist theory for
water conduction in plants (West et al. 1999), and Murrays
law (McCulloh et al. 2004).
The vulnerability of xylem conduits to cavitation is
empirically assessed through a number of methods, which
often consist of estimating the xylem tension (negative
pressure) at which 50% of the conductivity is lost (Y50, see
Tyree & Zimmermann 2002). Y50 varies greatly among
species, from )0.18 MPa to )14 MPa, with larger absolute
values in conifers than in angiosperms (Maherali et al. 2004).
Based on empirical evidence, there is general agreement that
the primary cause of water stress-induced embolism is
penetration of air through pit membranes, a process known
as air-seeding. Increasing porosity of pit membranes makes
water transport more efﬁcient, but it also makes transport-
ing elements more vulnerable to air-seeding. Recent studies
have suggested that it is the total area of intervessel pit
membranes in a vessel rather than the individual pit

sectioning. A particular vessel may jump from one vessel group to

structure that is most important in determining a vessels
cavitation resistance and transport efﬁciency (Hacke et al.
2006).
How do conduit properties co-vary? The frequency of
conduits mm)2 was correlated negatively with the mean
diameter of those conduits across a wide range of conifer
and of angiosperm species (ﬁg. 1a in Sperry et al. 2008). This
is in agreement with the idea that fewer wide conduits than
narrow ones can pack into a unit area of stem. Second,
sapwood area hydraulic conductivity KS (conductivity per
unit of cross-sectional sapwood area) also scales with
conduit diameter in conifers and angiosperms, and the
scaling is consistent with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation
(Fig. 2a, see also Sperry et al. 2006). This equation places a
ceiling on the value of KS (solid line labelled lumen
conductivity in Fig. 2a), as in reality the laminar ﬂow of
water in conduits has been measured at anywhere from 20%
to 100% of theoretical conductivity. Third, typically water
molecules must pass between many thousands of conduits
in order to move from the roots to the canopy. Hence, in
addition to the resistance imposed by the conduits, water
will encounter resistance imposed by conduit end walls. The
resistance accounted for by end walls is 50% of total
xylem hydraulic resistance, suggesting that pit structure in
end walls plays an important role in the overall hydraulic
efﬁciency of plants (Choat et al. 2008). Finally, only a weak
relationship has been found between sapwood area hydrau-
lic conductivity KS and Y50 (Fig. 2b). In a meta-analysis of
the literature, Maherali et al. (2004) found that the signiﬁcant
relationship between KS and Y50 was primarily driven by the
structural difference between conifers and angiosperms. If
the two clades are considered separately (or a phylogenet-
ically independent contrast analysis is performed), no
correlation
was
observed.
These
results
suggest
that
vulnerability to cavitation and hydraulic efﬁciency are largely
independent axes of the wood economy spectrum. Such
ﬁndings are somewhat surprising as air-seeding is thought to
be related to vessel volume and if diameter and length scale
then one would expect diameter and vulnerability to be
related (Sperry et al. 2008).
It is often believed that wood density and water transport
efﬁciency should be correlated because tissue density is
related to the amount of space dedicated to conduits. At
least in angiosperms, evidence for the relationship between
vessel anatomy and wood density is mixed (Preston et al.
2006; Pratt et al. 2007). The proportions of non-conducting
elements, such as ﬁbres, vary greatly among species (Gartner
et al. 2004). For instance, some angiosperm species with
dense wood, such as Leptospermum scoparium in New Zealand,
contain a scattering of large conduits within a matrix of
fibres (Meylan & Butterﬁeld 1978) so may not have
especially low conductivity, provided that these conduits
remain free from embolism. Additionally, ﬁbres are the
main tissue providing mechanical strength in angiosperms.
Fibre wall thickness can vary across species and is typically a
strong correlate of wood density (Pratt et al. 2007). We
computed the mean wood density for the species with very
thin-walled ﬁbres and those with very thick-walled ﬁbres,
and found that species with very thick-walled ﬁbres had a
signiﬁcantly higher mean wood density than species with
very thin-walled ﬁbres (Appendix 3). Furthermore, wood
density is typically negatively related to capacitance, the
ability of wood to store and release water under tension
(Jacobsen et al. 2007; Pratt et al. 2007; Sperry et al. 2008).

Wood density then is related to transport safety if not
transport efﬁciency.
C. Mechanical properties
Plant shape is limited by structural constraints of mechanical
stability against bending and buckling (Niklas 1995). The
ability of plants to resist bending or breakage should be
important across different ecological settings, depending on
the likelihood of environmental disturbances. The elasticity
to bending is measured by Youngs modulus (modulus of
elasticity), deﬁned as the ratio of stress over strain, in MPa.
If too large a stress is applied to a material, it loses its
elasticity, and eventually breaks. The stress needed to reach
this point is called modulus of rupture (also in MPa). Other
quantities have been routinely reported in the wood
mechanics literature, including the dynamic resilience to
breakage and the resistance to splitting (Appendix 4). These
measures may also be of relevance to ecological studies.
Additionally, denser wood is known to convey greater
mechanical stability (Niklas 1995; Jacobsen et al. 2007; Pratt
et al. 2007; Poorter 2008). Figure 3 reports the correlation of
four wood mechanical traits with wood density among
angiosperm species. A signiﬁcantly positive correlation was
found in all four cases.
How do these standard wood measurements relate to the
conditions
encountered
by
living
trees
in
the
ﬁeld?
Surprisingly few publications address this topic (Niklas
1993; Jacobsen et al. 2007; Pratt et al. 2007; Poorter 2008).
van Gelder et al. (2006), however, reported ﬁgures for
Youngs modulus ranging between 2000 and 8000 MPa, and
modulus of rupture between 5 and 30 MPa, both in the low
range (Fig. 3) compared with laboratory measurements.
This discrepancy may be understood by the fact that ﬁeld
samples were measured in wet condition, and Youngs
modulus is smaller for wet than for dry samples (Mencuccini
et al. 1997).
D. Defence properties
Plants must defend themselves against their predators and
pathogens but also against natural hazards, such as ﬁre,
snow or wind. One mechanism of defence after the
development of an infection or wound is compartmental-
ization of decay via a barrier zone made of non-conducting
tissue (Shigo 1984; Pearce 1996). Other defence mecha-
nisms, most efﬁcient against animals and pathogens, consist
of synthesizing chemicals (Hawley et al. 1924). Over 25 000
secondary compounds are known in plants (Croteau et al.
2000), and these compounds are believed to be critical for
the evolution of plant defence (Agrawal & Fishbein 2006).
For instance, the chemical deposition that occurs during
heartwood formation helps prevent attack from predators
and pathogens (Hillis 1987; Schultz et al. 1995). The
presence of secondary compounds in hardwood has long
been thought to be related to their durability (Hawley et al.
1924). However, to our knowledge, a database cataloguing
the presence and amount of secondary compounds in wood,
especially relative to wood durability is missing; as a result
no large cross-species check of this hypothesis is available.
A simple test of this hypothesis is whether coloured
(brown or red) hardwoods, richer in secondary compounds,

are more durable than light-coloured hardwoods. Scheffer &
Morrell (1998) reported the durability of wood of many
species based on graveyard experiments, where pieces of
hardwood were placed in the ground and deterioration
status recorded. Heartwood colour is available for some of
these species from the InsideWood database. We combined
both datasets to show that dark-coloured hardwoods were
signiﬁcantly more resistant to decay than light-coloured
ones in agreement with the hypothesis (Appendix 5).
E. The wood economics spectrum
Baas et al. (2004) suggested the existence of a trade-off
triangle comprised of (i) a negative trade-off between the
resistance to embolism (Y50) and conductive efﬁciency, (ii) a
negative
trade-off
between
conductive
efﬁciency
and
mechanical strength and (iii) a positive relation between
resistance to embolism and mechanical damage. While the
relationships suggested by Baas et al. (2004) are intuitive, we
suggest that they do not encompass the full range of
variation in wood properties (e.g. water and carbon storage
and defence properties), so may be missing key components
needed for determining the economy of stem structure and
function. Furthermore, relationships between hydraulic
conductivity and both resistance to embolism and mechan-
ical strength have fairly limited empirical support. Figure 4
summarizes the relations between major ecological func-
tions and the above-mentioned wood traits.
Based upon the evidence presented above, we suggest
that a more comprehensive wood economics spectrum may
be deﬁned, as the three following points hold. (i) A number
of key ecologically-relevant woody stem variables are
available (Table 1). (ii) Some of these traits co-vary. With
respect to water transport, conduit dimensions correlate
with hydraulic conductivity KS, and wood density correlates
with vulnerability to embolism. Several variables describe
mechanical properties of wood and these variables relate
strongly to wood density. Finally, heartwood colour, a likely
indicator of secondary compound deposition, is related to
wood durability. (iii) The observed covariation in traits
should reﬂect trade-offs in carbon and nutrient allocation
patterns across species.
As discussed above, the existence of a wood economics
spectrum depends on a fourth condition, namely that plants

properties are reported around the triangle (see also main text):

properties (resistance to decay and embolism). The outer circle

maximize ﬁtness by making allocation decisions that
optimize growth and survival across all tissues. The next
section presents evidence of coordination and trade-offs
between wood traits and other plant traits. We also take the
integrator trait of wood density and relate it to the
demographic variables of growth and survival to determine
how this stem trait may be affecting long-term reproductive
success in woody plant species.
3. WOOD TRAITS IN RELATION TO OTHER
F U N C T I O NA L T R A I T S
A. Wood and morphological traits
Potential height has been related to a number of wood traits.
Taller plants have bigger conduits in their trunks, but fewer
conduits in total (Preston et al. 2006), because taller plants
have longer path lengths and therefore need wider vessels to
maintain hydraulic conductivity (Coomes et al. 2008). The
presence of wider conduits in tall plants may also be related
to biomechanical constraints, which are likely to be more
limiting in taller organisms. For instance, wider conduits are
more efﬁcient per unit of area leaving more space for
supporting ﬁbres. Reported relationships between height
and wood density or height and strength are mixed (Falster
& Westoby 2005; van Gelder et al. 2006; Preston et al. 2006;
Poorter 2008). Both Niklas (1993) and Poorter (2008) show
the importance of density of different anatomical structures
and how the distribution of those structures change with
height.
Growth form is likely related to wood traits in similar
ways to plant height as taller trees would be expected to
have larger vessels than shorter shrubs. Wood anatomical
features were strongly associated with growth form in a
study of chaparral species (Carlquist & Hoekman 1985).
Lianas, as parasites of free standing plants, allocate fewer
resources to mechanical support (Ewers & Fisher 1991;
McCulloh et al. 2004). A greater proportion of the cross-
sectional area of liana wood may be dedicated to vessels,
with the vessels often found to be both wide and numerous
(Baas et al. 2004). As a result, water transport efﬁciency of
lianas is similar to that of free standing plants (Cernuzak
et al. 2008).
B. Wood and leaf traits
Leaf size decreases with increasing wood density (Wright
et al. 2007). This relationship could be driven by hydraulics
with larger leaves demanding greater sap (Coomes et al.
2008). Thus as conduit fraction increases wood density may
decrease (although this relationship has been mixed at least
for angiosperms; Preston et al. 2006; Pratt et al. 2007). The
pattern between leaf size and wood density may instead be
part of a whole-plant strategy with species with larger leaves
having faster volumetric growth and lower wood density.
Alternatively, this relationship between wood density and
leaf size may be due to both traits being related to the
amount of leaf area deployed per unit of stem (Wright et al.
2007). Denser wood tends to be found in species with
thinner branches (Sterck et al. 2006) and lower leaf area per
stem mass or per stem area (Ackerly 2004; Wright et al.
2006b; but see Bucci et al. 2004). Species with bigger vessels
also typically have more leaf area per sapwood area (Preston
et al. 2006).
In the leaf economics spectrum, an axis of variation exists
in leaf construction from cheap tissue investment and fast
returns on that investment, to expensive tissue investment
and slower returns (Wright et al. 2004). One might expect
that leaf economics traits related to slow returns on
investment would be tied to dense wood (Wright et al.
2007); however, evidence for such a correlation has been
mixed. Santiago et al. (2004) found wood density and
photosynthetic capacity (Amass) to be negatively related.
While two studies found that speciﬁc leaf area (leaf area⁄leaf
mass) and wood density were negatively related (Bucci et al.
2004; Ishida et al. 2008), another found no correlation
(Wright et al. 2007). Ishida et al. (2008) did ﬁnd wood
density to be positively related to leaf lifespan but not to
photosynthetic rates. These mixed ﬁndings suggest that
relationships between stem and leaf function are complex
and merit further investigation.
Minimum leaf water potential (the tension measured in
leaves during the driest season of the year) has been put
forward as a proxy for maximum rooting depth (Ackerly
2004), when comparing species within a given ecosystem. It
is assumed that species with deeper roots will have better
access to soil water and thus less minimum leaf water
potentials
(McElrone
et al.
2004).
Wood
density
has
repeatedly been related negatively to minimum leaf water
potential (Ackerly 2004; Bucci et al. 2004; Santiago et al.
2004), and presumably plant rooting depth.
C. Wood and demography
Ultimately, if wood economics trade-offs exist, then wood
traits should be related to long-term viability of the plant
species, which may be measured by its growth and survival
rates.
Growth
There are two reasons to expect that stem growth rates
should decrease as wood density increases. First, a smaller
volume of wood is, by deﬁnition, produced per unit biomass
invested in dense wood (Enquist et al. 1999; Roderick 2000).
Second, dense wood may have a lower conduit fraction,
which could result in a lower rate of transpiration,

photosynthesis and biomass growth (but see Section 2B
above). Several studies have reported signiﬁcant negative
correlations between wood density and the mean diameter
growth rate of species estimated from permanently marked
individuals (Muller-Landau 2004; Nascimento et al. 2005;
Fig. 5a). However, reported correlations are weak and
disappear altogether when a few gap-demanding species
were removed from one analysis (Nascimento et al. 2005).
This result is not surprising given the many factors
inﬂuencing growth and the different ways in which growth
is measured. In comparisons among tree plots, slow growth
in diameter was found to be associated with high wood
density, e.g. in forests in Amazonia (Chao et al. 2008) and
Malaysia (King et al. 2006). It should be noted that in some
instances, having dense wood may lead to greater annual
growth rates. Fibres and thick-walled vessels found in high-
density wood protect vessels from implosion when water
shortage creates strongly negative xylem potentials (Hacke
et al. 2001a,b). If correct, such an adaptation may allow
heavy-wooded plant species from seasonally dry climates to
continue growing when lighter-wooded species are forced
into shutting down their water transport systems.
The relationship between growth and wood density has
been of great interest to plantation foresters (Fujimoto et al.
2006; Boufﬁer et al. 2008; Weber & Sotelo Montes 2008).
Breeding trials involve planting genotypes of timber species
under similar conditions and comparing their diameter
growth and wood density. These trials reveal that intraspe-
ciﬁc correlations between growth and density are often
weak, or nonexistent, leading to the conclusion that fast-
growing genotypes can be selected without compromising
on wood quality (Weber & Sotelo Montes 2008). For
example, the correlation is inconsistent when all the conifer
literature was reviewed (Boufﬁer et al. 2008). A negative
correlation between wood density and radial growth rate
was found for young hybrid larch, but this relationship
weakened considerably with age (Fujimoto et al. 2006).
Factors other than wood density (e.g. plant age; Fujimoto
et al. 2006) as well as differences in the way that growth is
measured inﬂuence growth in these forestry and ecological
studies, masking covariance between these two variables.
Survival
High-density wood is associated with low mortality rates in
diverse tropical forests (Fig. 5b). Negative correlations
between wood density and mortality rate of adult trees
have been reported for species in several tropical forests in
the Neotropics and Malaysia (e.g. Nascimento et al. 2005;
King et al. 2006; Alvarez-Clare & Kitajima 2007; Osunkoya
et al. 2007; Chao et al. 2008; Fig. 5b; but see Poorter et al.
2008). As shown above, wood properties are closely related
to mechanical stability, and this function proves critical for
survival of trees exposed to disturbance. Curran et al. (2008)
found that species with low density wood in Queensland
were less able to withstand the passing of a severe tropical
cyclone. The picture is less clear in temperate regions.
Canham et al. (2001) reported that early-successional species
(purportedly with low density wood) in north-eastern USA
were more susceptible to damage than late-successional
species, but only when they were small; larger trees were
observed to lose many branches in storms but nevertheless
survive.
Several patterns emerge from the evidence presented in
Section 3. First, free-standing plants with larger vessels are
taller and deploy more leaf area per unit sapwood area. Thus
plants that are larger both aboveground (and potentially
belowground) may have a vascular network with bigger
conduits that are able to supply greater total leaf area.
Second, wood density correlates with important axes of
stem function, and appears to be coordinated with traits
across the whole plant, including leaf size, minimum leaf
water potential and perhaps rooting depth. Third, wood

the Center for Tropical Forest Science (see Chave et al. 2008, and

density is related to measures of plant performance,
especially survival and in some cases growth. A fast–slow
continuum of plant performance matches wood traits, with
slow growing and lower mortality species having denser
wood, smaller leaves, smaller twigs and lower minimum leaf
water potentials. It seems likely that these slow growing
species should also have higher mechanical strength and⁄or
better chemical defence. Overall, this evidence– albeit
indirect – supports important differences in allocation to
different stem and whole-plant functions and the existence
of a wood economics spectrum.

A. Geographical variation of major wood traits
The distribution and diversity of organisms has seldom been
explored on large spatial scales upon the basis of their
function. A step towards a global scale functional ecology
has been to search for consistencies in leaf trait correlations
across environments (Wright et al. 2004). This step has also
been taken for a few of the major wood traits. For instance,
along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient from tropical,
subtropical, temperate to artic or alpine climates, a number
of important wood anatomical traits vary. Vessel element
length, vessel diameter and frequency of vestured pits
(outgrowths from the pit chamber that surround the pit
membrane) decrease, while the incidence of scalariform
perforations and (ﬁbre-) tracheids increase (Carlquist 2001;
Jansen et al. 2004; Wheeler et al. 2007). Another illustration
of wood anatomy shifting with climates is the increasing
frequency of growth rings and ring porosity with seasonality
(Wheeler et al. 2007).
Wood density has also been shown to vary with latitude:
tropical species have similar mean wood densities as
temperate assemblages, but with broader ranges and
variances (Wiemann & Williamson 2002). This latitudinal
pattern also appears to be mirrored along elevation gradients
within tropical latitudes with a decrease in the range of
values with elevation (Williamson 1984). Our support of
these ﬁndings is mixed. Table 2 reports the regional cross-
species means of wood density, showing that these means
vary from c. 0.5 g cm)3 in temperate regions to over
0.7 g cm)3 in subtropical environments.
Variation in wood density has also been examined across
climatic and soil nutrient gradients (Wiemann & Williamson
2002; Baker et al. 2004; Swenson & Enquist 2007). Analysis
of genus-level traits from 277 069 stems across Amazon
Basin forests showed a consistent relationship of higher
community-average wood density from the North-East of
the continent to the South-West, approximately following a
gradient in soil fertility and not climate (ter Steege et al.
2006). Community-average wood density varied from
0.73 g cm)3 in Guyana to just 0.56 g cm)3 in Peruvian
and Bolivian forests (Malhi et al. 2006; ter Steege et al. 2006).
The regional-scale pattern of species composition and
associated wood density therefore deﬁne the broad gradient
of carbon content of live vegetation across Amazonia (Malhi
et al. 2006). A negative relationship between wood density
and soil fertility appears widespread (Baker et al. 2004; ter
Steege et al. 2006; Patin˜o et al. 2008), as does a positive but
weaker relationship between wood density and temperature.
There appears to be little relationship between wood density

and rainfall (Wiemann & Williamson 2002; Swenson &
Enquist 2007).
One recognized weakness is that these observations come
from correlations using one-dimensional bi-variate plots in
biogeographical analyses of species function. Mapping the
distribution of species function in two or more dimensions
should be more insightful because climate variables are
unlikely to be independently inﬂuencing trait values. Here
we present an example of this type of approach where we
combine geo-referenced herbarium specimen data with the
global dataset containing species means for wood density to
estimate mean wood density in one-degree grid cells in
North and South America (Fig. 6a). We then use this map
and underlying climatic data to produce a multiple regres-
sion model to predict a smoothed distribution of mean
wood densities across these two continents (Fig. 6b). A key
ﬁnding from this work is that the spatial distribution of this
trait cannot be summarized on the basis of a single predictor
variable (e.g. latitude). Previous work has predicted the
spatial distribution of mean wood densities on a continental
scale using a distance decay or inverse weighting method
(Swenson & Enquist 2007). The predictive model summa-
rized above explains nearly half of the variation in wood
density (r2 = 0.49) suggesting that such an approach could
be utilized to generate global scale maps of species function
for investigations of biogeochemical cycling and global
change modelling
(see
Section 5).
Multiple
regression
methods such as the one applied here for predictive
modelling may be preferred over a distance decay method
because there is no a priori justification for the decay in trait
values with geographical distance.
B. Phylogenetic patterns
Phylogenetic trends in wood anatomy and the systematic
signiﬁcance of various features have been illustrated for a
wide range of taxa (Baas et al. 2000, 2004; Carlquist 2001).
The transformation of vessel element perforation plates
from scalariform to simple ones in combination with a
decrease in vessel element length is commonly regarded as
one of the major trends of secondary xylem evolution
established by the Baileyan school (Bailey 1944). This
pattern was considered for a long time to be one of the
strongest and most reliable phylogenetic trends in plant
anatomy. More recent studies on the distribution of
vestured pits have illustrated that this character represents
another wood anatomical feature with a strong phylogenetic
signal in angiosperms (Jansen et al. 2004). Although in many
cases wood anatomical diversity patterns reﬂect their
phylogenetic signiﬁcance, there is a considerable amount
of homoplasy, which can partly be interpreted as a result of
ecological adaptations for water transport and mechanical
support (Sperry 2003). Ecological trends in turn can be

global wood density database to geo-referenced herbarium specimen

occurrences in that cell (i.e. the mean is not weighted by the number
of occurrences for each species in that cell). (b) Predicted mean wood
density value in 1-degree grid cells on the basis of climatic variables.
This predicted map was made using a multiple regression model
(r2 = 0.49) where data from panel (a) was the dependent variable,
and mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation
seasonality and temperature seasonality were the independent
variables (see Appendix 7 for more information on these methods).

understood as functional adaptations when considering
trade-offs between structure and function in different
growth forms and environments, especially with respect
to conductive efﬁciency, vulnerability to embolism and
mechanical strength (Baas et al. 2004).
Based on the current consensus of a family-level
phylogeny in angiosperms, a strong phylogenetic signal
has also been documented in wood density (Chave et al.
2006; Swenson & Enquist 2007), meaning that more closely
related species share more similar wood density values than
less closely related species. Additionally, wood density has
shown evolutionary coordination with other plant traits,
including seed size (Wright et al. 2007) and resistance to
drought-induced embolisms and capacitance (Jacobsen et al.
2007; Pratt et al. 2007).

A. The carbon cycle
Wood holds c. 850 Pg dry mass globally (1 Pg = 1 ·
1015 g), equating to a stock of 425 Pg of carbon, a
globally signiﬁcant amount, compared to the current
atmospheric stock of 730 Pg C (Denman et al. 2007).
This carbon stock in wood assumes that the carbon
concentration in wood equals 50%. Some uncertainties
remain about this ﬁgure, however. The carbon content of
wood varies with species and possibly location, because
species with high lignin content tend also to have higher
carbon content (Elias & Potvin 2003; Thomas & Malczew-
ski 2007). Thus, there may also be differences in carbon
content depending upon the successional status of the
species (Thomas & Malczewski 2007). Volatile organic
compounds in wood may add up to 1.6–3.5% of the current
estimates of C stocks in wood (Thomas & Malczewski
2007). While these modiﬁers of the 50% rule are small, a
change of 0.2% would be equivalent to an error of 1 Pg C
on the total carbon ﬂux estimate.
The carbon content of individual trees, and hence
patches of forest, is critically dependent on knowledge of
the tissue density of a given tree. Studies on harvested
trees
show
that
wood
density
is
the
second
most
important parameter necessary to accurately predict the
mass of a tree, after its diameter, and more important than
the
height
(Chave
et al.
2005).
Recent
analyses
of
Amazonian forests highlight the importance of regional
variation in community-averaged wood density in deter-
mining carbon stocks (see above). Baker et al. (2004)
estimated that regional variation in community-averaged
wood density accounted for 29.7% or 45.4% of the total
variation in aboveground biomass (and therefore carbon
content) for plots across Amazonia (depending upon the
tree allometry assumed). The 23% decline in community-
average wood density from East to West Amazonia (ter
Steege et al. 2006) coincides with a threefold increase in
wood biomass production (Malhi et al. 2004) and forest
dynamism (Lewis et al. 2004). Such rapid dynamism and
low residence time of stems in low community-average
wood density forest appear to preclude the accumulation
of high carbon stocks.
B. Other biogeochemical cycles
Even though angiosperm wood comprises an average of
only 1189 p.p.m. of nitrogen (N) in temperate regions
(Harmon et al. 1986), and 700–7200 in the tropics (e.g.
Kauffman et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2003), this scales up to
> 1 Pg across terrestrial ecosystems. The wood of conifers
is less enriched in N (mean: 704 p.p.m.), while bark has up
to a ﬁvefold greater concentration in N than wood (Harmon
et al. 1986). The Ca concentration is comparable to that of
N, followed by Mg, K and Mn concentrations, and S and P
concentrations (Harmon et al. 1986). For P, which may be
an important limiting nutrient for many tropical forests,
concentrations in wood are lower, at 150 and 250 p.p.m. for
four Amazonian and one Asian forest respectively (Kauff-
man et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2003). However, surprisingly little
data are available on P content of wood, compared to the
extensive work on foliar concentrations (Wright et al. 2004).
The low concentration of P and N in wood gives
exceptionally low Redﬁeld-type molar C : N : P ratios,
compared to classic marine Redﬁeld ratios, with wood
having lower Redﬁeld ratios than foliage, ﬁne roots, and
even leaf litter (McGroddy et al. 2004). The low C : N : P
ratio of wood suggests that wood may be an important
location of the terrestrial carbon sink of 2.6 Pg C year)1 in
the 1990s (Denman et al. 2007). As plants increase their
wood mass, they exert low additional nutrient demand
compared to that expected if the same amount of carbon
were incorporated into other biological materials. A careful
assessment of forest inventory results, taking into account
wood density suggest this to be the case, with signiﬁcant
sinks in forest trees (Baker et al. 2004; Luyssaert et al. 2008;
Lewis et al. 2009).
C. Tissue turnover
The oxidation of wood is a major ﬂux of carbon from
terrestrial to atmospheric pools: tropical forest conversion
to other land uses is the second largest anthropogenic
source of carbon to the atmosphere after fossil fuel use
(Denman et al. 2007). The size of the ﬂux is poorly
quantiﬁed, largely because the amount of tropical forest that
is cut and burnt is difﬁcult to quantify, the carbon stocks in
a given area of forest vary considerably and the carbon
stocks are poorly quantiﬁed in most areas (Lewis 2006). Best

estimates among studies range from 0.9 to 2.2 Pg C year)1,
with a central estimate from recent studies of 1.6 (95% CI,
0.5–2.7) Pg C year)1 for the 1990s (Denman et al. 2007;
Ramankutty et al. 2007).
The rate at which wood decomposes determines the
structural complexity and turnover of resources in ecosys-
tems. In a thorough review of the decomposition of coarse
woody debris in temperate ecosystems, Harmon et al. (1986)
showed that the half-life of dead wood depended on several
environmental and species-speciﬁc factors, and varied
between a few years to over a century. The same orders
of magnitude were found in tropical forests (Chambers et al.
2000). The main pathways for breakdown of wood are ﬁre,
xylophagous creatures, microbes (fungi, bacteria) and photo
damage, although dysfunction and decay can happen via
viruses as well.
Secondary chemicals have evolved as deterrents to insect
damage (Croteau et al. 2000), and they occur in larger
concentrations in bark, the outer defensive layer of
functional wood and phloem. In addition, high-density
woods decompose slower than low-density woods (Fig. 7,
see also Chambers et al. 2000). From the data used to
construct Fig. 7, we found that decay rate and wood density
were
strongly
correlated
in
angiosperms
(R2 = 0.208,
n = 768, P < 0.001), but not in conifers (R2 = 0.020,
n = 67, P = 0.249). The physical structure of wood, in
addition to the tissue density and chemical composition,
should influence fungal movement within the plant, and
reduce the spread of fungal infections (Choat et al. 2008).
Greater overall allocation to ﬁbres and less allocation to
conduits and parenchyma should also make wood less
vulnerable to fungal decay (Fengel & Wegner 1984).
What causes differences in decomposition has been less
well studied. In a meta-analysis, Weedon et al. (2009)
associated decomposition rates of 102 woody species with
chemical and anatomical wood traits. Across all species, they
found that decomposition was faster in angiosperms than
gymnosperms. Angiosperms had denser wood, bigger
conduits, higher nitrogen and phosphorous content, lower
lignin content and lignin to nitrogen ratios (Cowling &
Merril 1966). It is typically thought that less dense wood
should decay more quickly, so the result that the less dense
gymnosperms decay more slowly is surprising. Whether
differences in decomposition between the two groups are
due to chemical differences (e.g. the higher lignin or lower
nitrogen and phosphorous in gymnosperms) or physical
differences (e.g. shorter and narrower conduits in gymno-
sperms) remains unclear.

Our review of wood traits, their interrelations and correla-
tions with morphological, leaf and demographic traits and
associated biogeographical and biogeochemical implications
suggest that the functional ecological signiﬁcance of wood is
high (Fig. 4). However, this ﬁrst synthesis also highlights
some serious data deﬁciencies, and associated analyses
needed to accurately describe functional trade-offs in wood.
Ecologists should contribute to such a research programme.
Perhaps the most important task is to develop an agreed
list of traits (Table 1) for a representative geo-referenced
sample of woody plants from the worlds biomes and
biogeographical realms. Along with existing online databases
(E.A. Wheelers InsideWood database http://insidewood.
lib.ncsu.edu/, see Wheeler et al. 2007) our data compilations
have made some progress in this respect, but much more
data are needed. Indeed, we have not attempted to construct
a full matrix for the 20 or so traits listed in Table 1, because
it would have been depressingly sparse. Among the most
poorly documented are chemical traits in wood. To date
these data have been conﬁned to a specialized literature;
however, it should be possible to compile datasets at a pace
comparable to leaf chemistry datasets that have been
assembled (e.g. Wright et al. 2004, 2007). The techniques
of gathering N, P, K and Ca concentration from wood
tissue are indeed now available in many laboratories across
the world.
One important use of new information and an improved
understanding of a well-deﬁned wood economy spectrum
would likely be in the development of more realistic
dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). DGVMs
model Earths vegetation and its response to changing
atmospheric conditions such as increasing atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentrations and increasing air tempera-
tures. These DGVMs show that forest dynamics could
dramatically alter the response of the global climate system
to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide over the 21st
century with potentially serious societal and environmental

implications (Huntingford et al. 2008). However, there is
little agreement among different DGVMs, making forest
dynamics a major source of uncertainty in predicting future
climate (Cramer et al. 2004).
Current DGVMs reduce complex forests to the total
carbon stocks in various compartments – leaves, roots and
trunks – with simple rules to determine how the carbon
generated from photosynthesis is allocated to, and lost from,
each compartment. Therefore, these models contain no
information about wood. This absence is surprising as one
of the key predictions of these models is the carbon storage
per unit area at each time-step, essentially an estimate of the
mass of wood, as > 90% of plant mass is woody.
The incorporation of wood traits in future DGVMs is
likely to come from scaling up individual-based models of
tree behaviour in forests (Marks & Lechowicz 2006) to
regional and global scales (Purves & Pacala 2008). Alloca-
tion to wood is pivotal in such individual-based models,
because they are based on competition for light, and
individual plants invest in trunks to over-top others in a
competitive struggle for light. Careful parameterization of
global-scale individual-based models using data on patterns
from a well-described wood economy spectrum may
substantially reduce the uncertainty associated with current
DGVMs. In turn, this would provide more robust predic-
tions of future vegetation and climate as human activity
alters the Earth system.

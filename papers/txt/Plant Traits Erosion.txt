Abstract 
13 
Vegetation controls concentrated runoff and erosion in the European loess belt by 
14 
increasing hydraulic roughness and sediment retention. Studies of plant effects on runoff 
15 
velocity are usually based on a taxonomical characterisation and do not consider the 
16 
effects of aboveground plant functional traits in attempts to understand soil erosion by 
17 
water. This trait-based plant study investigates aboveground plant functional trait effects 
18 
of herbaceous hedges on the hydraulic roughness to understand soil erosion. Eight 
19 
aboveground functional traits were measured on fourteen indigenous and perennial plant 
20 
species (caespitose or comprising dry biomass in winter) from north-west Europe with a 
21 
high morphological variability. For each trait, density-weighted traits were calculated.

The effects of functional traits and density-weighted traits were examined using a runoff 
23 
simulator with four discharges. The leaf density and area, as well as density-weighted 
24 
stem and leaf areas, stem diameter and specific leaf area were positively correlated with 
25 
the hydraulic roughness. Generalised linear models defined the best combinations of traits 
26 
and density-weighted traits: (1) leaf density and leaf area, (2) density-weighted leaf area 
27 
and density-weighted projected stem area, and (3) density-weighted leaf area and density-
28 
weighted stem diameter. Moreover, the effects of leaf density, leaf area and density-
29 
weighted specific leaf area, varied depending on the discharge. This study is one of the 
30 
first characterisation of aboveground trait effects on hydraulic roughness and highlights 
31 
that vegetation with important stem density, diameter and leaf area plays a significant role 
32 
in minimising soil erosion. The selection of plant species can derive from these plant trait 
33 
effects to design reconstructed herbaceous hedges to minimise soil erosion.

1. Introduction 
40 
Soil erosion by water is influenced by precipitation, soil texture and structure, slopes that 
41 
can generate intense discharges, and plant and litter covers which vary according to 
42 
cultural practices in cultivated areas. Intense runoff and soil erosion are frequently found 
43 
in north-western European catchments where the sloping loamy soils are intensively tilled 
44 
and cultivated with annual crops (Boardman and Poesen, 2006; Gobin et al., 2003). In the 
45 
European loess belt, erosion can be mitigated by both (1) tillage reduction and the 
46 

 
3
establishment of cover crops during sensitive seasons which increase the crop residue 
47 
quantity on soil surface and thus, reduce the rill and inter-rill soil erosion (Knapen et al., 
48 
2007), and (2) establishment of vegetative barriers across the thalweg to mitigate rill and 
49 
ephemeral gully erosion (Richet et al., 2017). Richet et al. (2017) demontrated the effects 
50 
of fascines (i.e. vegetative barriers made of bundles of stems) on hydraulic roughness and 
51 
soil erosion mitigation however, their short lifetime and high cost represent a main 
52 
limitation. Herbaceous hedges, defined as narrow strips of dense and stiff perennial 
53 
vegetation, constitute a major interest to develop vegetative barriers with a high efficiency 
54 
on the reduction of soil erosion at lower cost against concentrated flows (Dabney et al., 
55 
1995; Yuan et al., 2009). Besides, herbaceous hedges composed of indigenous plant 
56 
species could offer other ecosystem services than regulating services such as the provision 
57 
of habitats and their ecological connectivity in these catchments (Ouin and Burel, 2002; 
58 
Smith et al., 2008). 
59 
The effect of herbaceous vegetation on runoff and soil erosion, have been studied over 
60 
the past decades (Haan et al., 1994; Lambrechts et al., 2014; Ludwig et al., 2005; Temple 
61 
et al., 1987). Blanco-Canqui et al. (2006), Dosskey et al. (2010), Lambrechts et al. (2014), 
62 
Le Bissonnais et al. (2005), Ruiz-Colmenero et al. (2013) and Stokes et al. (2014) noted 
63 
the direct effects of vegetation cover on splash detachment and inter-rill erosion 
64 
reduction. The impact of plant roots on infiltration capacity and resistance of soils to 
65 
erosion by water has been well documented (Berendse et al., 2015; Dabney et al., 2009; 
66 
De Baets et al., 2006; De Baets and Poesen, 2010; Gyssels et al., 2005; Isselin-Nondedeu 
67 
and Bédécarrats, 2007; Lambrechts et al., 2014). The influence of vegetation on sediment 
68 
retention was highlighted (Burylo et al., 2012; Dabney et al., 2009; Dillaha et al., 1989; 
69 
Haan et al., 1994; Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007; Lowrance et al., 1995). The 
70 

 
4
relationship between vegetation and sediment retention can be understood only if the 
71 
vegetation effect on hydraulic roughness, which is the frictional resistance due to the 
72 
contact of runoff with the vegetation, is characterised, as it is the main process with 
73 
gravity furthering sediment retention. This effect has been previously investigated 
74 
(Akram et al., 2014; Cantalice et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015; Haan et al., 1994; Järvelä, 
75 
2002; Temple et al., 1987). The presence of herbaceous vegetation has positive impacts 
76 
on hydraulic roughness, as it reduces flow velocity and increases backwater depth (Akram 
77 
et al., 2014; Cantalice et al., 2015; Hussein et al., 2007), thereby increasing sediment 
78 
retention due to its linear relationship with backwater depth (Dabney et al., 1995; Hussein 
79 
et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 1995). Plant effects on hydraulic roughness are highly variable 
80 
among species and are difficult to explain without characterisation of all aboveground 
81 
morphological traits (Cantalice et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015; Dabney et al., 1995). The 
82 
relationship between aboveground plant morphology and hydraulic roughness should be 
83 
specified to globally understand runoff and soil erosion processes.  
84 
One of the challenges to improving the understanding in plant and vegetation (e.g. 
85 
herbaceous hedges) effects on hydraulic roughness and soil erosion is the development 
86 
of a functional trait-based approach (Faucon et al., 2017). This approach, which allows 
87 
for characterising trait effects on ecosystem processes and services (Lavorel and Garnier, 
88 
2002), has been developed with the establishment of the relationship between the soil 
89 
detachment ratio and root length density for underground biomass (De Baets and Poesen, 
90 
2010; Mekonnen et al., 2016; Vannoppen et al., 2015). Concerning aboveground 
91 
characteristics, trait-based approaches highlighted the relationships between stem density, 
92 
diameter and stiffness, and between leaf area and density with sediment retention (Bochet 
93 
et al., 2000; Burylo et al., 2012; Mekonnen et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015). Because the 
94 

 
5
hydraulic roughness is one of the main process influencing sediment retention, plant 
95 
functional traits known to influence sediment retention could influence the hydraulic 
96 
roughness. Those traits, such as the stem and tiller density (Hayes et al., 1978; Isselin-
97 
Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007; Morgan and Duzant, 2008; Temple, 1982), stem 
98 
diameter (Bochet et al., 2000; Meyer et al., 1995; Morgan and Duzant, 2008), stem 
99 
stiffness (Dabney et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 1995), specific leaf area (Graff et al., 2005), 
100 
leaf area (Burylo et al., 2012) and leaf density (Lambrechts et al., 2014), should be 
101 
considered to specifically characterise the effect of aboveground traits on hydraulic 
102 
roughness. In addition to characterising vegetation effects on hydrological processes and, 
103 
notably, hydraulic roughness, the weight of traits in the vegetation should be considered 
104 
(Garnier and Navas, 2012) to improve the overall understanding of soil erosion.  
105 
Plant functional trait effects on hydraulic roughness should vary according to water 
106 
discharge and different hydraulic processes (Cao et al., 2015). Vieira and Dabney (2012) 
107 
showed that flow resistance of vegetation changed with flow depth. Temple et al. (1987) 
108 
and Van Dijk et al. (1996) found that for low flows, the mean flow velocity was dependent 
109 
on the vegetation density. However, for higher flows, when the flow depth was higher 
110 
than the deflecting vegetation height, the leaf structures had less impact and the flow 
111 
resistance was primarily dependent on the stem density and length and on the stem 
112 
diameter and stiffness (Meyer et al., 1995; Temple et al., 1987). 
113 
  It is thus expected that high discharges would challenge the mechanical resistance 
114 
through the stiffness, the density and the diameter of the stems, while low discharges 
115 
would be impacted by the overall vegetation density. The challenge is to highlight plant 
116 
functional trait effects on hydraulic roughness at several discharges that are representative 
117 
of those present in catchments of north-west Europe. 
118

This study of trait-based plant ecohydrology examined the relationship between 
119 
aboveground plant functional traits with the hydraulic roughness at different discharges 
120 
in fourteen perennial plant species presenting contrasting aboveground functional traits. 
121 
The objectives are (1) to highlight the major functional traits influencing hydraulic 
122 
roughness and (2) to examine the effect of discharges on the relationship between plant 
123 
functional traits and hydraulic roughness to improve the understanding of soil erosion and 
124 
select candidate species to create reconstructed herbaceous ecosystems to mitigate soil 
125 
erosion in north-west Europe. 
126 
 
127 
2. Materials and methods 
128 
2.1. Plant materials 
129 
Fourteen plant species that display contrasting aboveground morphological traits were 
130 
chosen from 76 candidate species, resulting in six filters of selected functional types 
131 
involved in mitigation of soil erosion in north-west Europe applied to the 3,500 
132 
spermatophyte species from north-west Europe (Lambinon et al., 2012). These selective 
133 
filters were as follows: (1) Raunkiaer’s life-form categories of “herbaceous 
134 
chamaephytes”, “hemicryptophytes” and “geophytes”, i.e., perennial herbaceous 
135 
vegetation that provide an effective soil cover during all seasons; (2) the presence of fresh 
136 
(i.e., herbaceous chamaephytes and caespitose hemicryptophytes) or dry (i.e., non-
137 
caespitose hemicryptophytes and geophytes) biomass in winter when soil erosion is 
138 
observed in north-west Europe (Boardman and Poesen, 2006); (3) the presence of 
139 
rhizomes or stolon to ensure lateral spreading capacity and burial tolerance due to 
140 
sediment deposition; (4) vegetative height ≥ 20 cm, as it is the water maximal level in the 
141 
catchment in north-west Europe; (5) a broad ecological niche to select species able to 
142 

 
7
grow in several silty agricultural soils; and (6) non-weed species to prohibit their 
143 
expansion in agricultural territories of north-west Europe. 
144 
Thirteen of the tested species were from the list of candidates (Carex sylvatica, Carex 
145 
flacca, Carex acutiformis, Carex pendula, Artemisia vulgaris, Origanum vulgare, Lolium 
146 
perene, Senecio jacobaea, Tanacetum vulgare, Festuca arundinacea, Dactylis glomerata, 
147 
Melica nutans, Phalaris arundinacea) (Table 1). An exotic species, Miscanthus sinensis, 
148 
was also tested along the thirteen indigenous species as it is considered a model plant in 
149 
studies of plant hydraulic properties and erosion mitigation (Dabney et al., 2009).These 
150 
species, varying in leaf and stem traits (e.g., density, area and specific area – density, 
151 
diameter, specific density and dry matter content), were chosen to establish a range of 
152 
traits to highlight the effect of aboveground plant traits on hydraulic roughness. The 
153 
species were collected in natura, selecting only established individuals, and planted in 
154 
60 x 30 x 15 cm plots in early April 2016, creating 14 monospecific herbaceous hedges. 
155 
These vegetation plots consisted of a wooden frame with a 1.5 cm grid fence at the bottom 
156 
and were buried for three months prior the experiments to allow the full development of 
157 
the plants and roots. The plot design allowed for both plant growth and plot extraction for 
158 
the experiments in the runoff simulator.

2.2. Plant morphological trait measurements 
162 
Eight aboveground plant morphological traits (leaf – area, density and specific area; stem 
163 
– density, diameter, specific density, area and dry matter content), potentially involved in 
164 
increasing hydraulic roughness, were measured (Table 2) at three levels along the stem – 
165 
between 0 and 5 cm, 0 and 10 cm, and 0 and 20 cm – related to the variation of the water 
166 
flow depth. Sampling collection and process methods followed the guidelines from 
167 
(Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). The leaves and stems were wrapped in moist paper 
168 
and sealed in bags to limit water loss until the measures were complete, and they were 
169 
then dried at 70°C for 72 h.

11
Trait measurements were performed within two 10 x 10 cm quadrats in each plot, to 
173 
ensure representative sampling. Stem density was measured within each quadrat, defining 
174 
pseudoculms in sedge species (Cyperaceae) and tillers in grass species as stems. Fresh 
175 
and dry leaves were counted to determine the leaf density at each level along the stems in 
176 
the quadrats. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area were calculated from three mature 
177 
leaves per quadrat. The leaves were scanned while fresh using a 600 dpi resolution, and 
178 
the images were then analysed using the software Gimp 2.8 to determine the leaf area. 
179 
The SLA was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the oven-dry mass of the leaf. Stem 
180 
diameter, stem specific density and stem dry matter content were measured on three stems 
181 
per quadrat. Stem diameter (mm) was measured three times along each vertical level of 
182 
the fresh stem using a calliper. From the measurements of stem diameter, the projected 
183 
stem area was calculated using the rectangle area formula and represented the contact 
184 
area of a stem toward the flow direction. The stem specific density (mg.mm-3) was 
185 
calculated by dividing the oven-dry mass of the first 20 cm of the stem by the volume of 
186 
the stem, measured when still fresh. The volume of the stems was calculated using the 
187 
formula for the volume of a cylinder, except for the sledge species, which have triangular 
188 
stems, and for which we used the formula for the volume of a triangular prism. The stem 
189 
specific density of each height level along the stem was estimated using the volume of 
190 
each level by assuming the density was homogeneous within the stem section. The stem 
191 
specific density, representing the structural strength of a stem, was used as the estimation 
192 
of the plant resistance to the water flow (Burylo et al., 2012; Cornelissen et al., 2003; 
193 
Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). The stem dry matter content was calculated from the 
194 
ratio of the oven dry-mass of the first 20 cm of the stem and the fresh mass of the stem. 
195 
The mean values of the measured traits are listed in Appendices A1, A2 and A3. 
196 

 
12
To characterise the effect of the herbaceous hedge on hydraulic roughness, the density-
197 
weighted mean of the trait values was calculated for each trait as the mean value of the 
198 
trait multiplied by the proportion of the trait, here by the stem density for stem traits and 
199 
by leaf density for leaf traits. This method does not include plant cover, given that all 
200 
monospecific vegetation plot presented 100% cover and more precisely characterise the 
201 
abundance of traits from stem and leaf densities. These density-weighted traits were 
202 
determined for each vertical level along the stem (i.e. 0 – 5 cm, 0 – 10 cm and 0 – 20 cm). 
203 
 
204 
2.3. Hydraulic measurements 
205 
We used the same runoff simulator as Richet et al. (2017) to quantify the effect of plant 
206 
morphological traits on hydraulic roughness (Fig. 1). The simulator allowed the 
207 
recreation of a flow at chosen discharges and the measurement of hydrological parameters 
208 
resulting from the presence of plants. The upper and lower parts of the simulator are 
209 
equipped with flowmeters made of Venturi channels with a flow range of 0.06 L.s-1 to 6 
210 
L.s-1, comprising ultrasound probes that measure the water level in the channel at ± 1.26 
211 
mm. This system was manufactured by ISMA, France (Richet et al., 2017). The water 
212 
was circulating within the system, with the aid of two pumps and a reservoir, in a closed 
213 
circuit. The central part of the simulator is a channel setup with two galvanised iron 
214 
sheets. The channel was 60 cm wide and 5.40 m long along a 5% slope. The entire channel 
215 
was waterproofed using a plastic tarpaulin to avoid any water loss during the experiments. 
216 
The tarpaulin was placed in order to obtain a smooth channel bottom and limit bottom 
217 
roughness as much as possible. The roughness of the tarpaulin was determined by 
218 
experiment using a control plot without any plants and represented a small percentage of 
219 
the roughness created by the plants (Appendix B). The vegetation was placed 4 m away 
220 

 
13
from the head of the channel, in a 17 cm deep rectangular hole to level the ground with 
221 
the flow and the slope. The tarpaulin used in the upper part of the channel was placed 
222 
continually underneath the plot and through the lower part of the channel to avoid water 
223 
loss by infiltration. The boundary effects were minimal as the plants were left in the 
224 
wooden frame where they grew, and a wooden plank was placed along each side the entire 
225 
channel. The small gap areas along the base of the planks and the bottom of the channel 
226 
were sealed using clay. Along the channel, 7 spacers were set up to measure the 
227 
topography of the channel bed and the water heights in the backwater and downstream of 
228 
the plot. Five were located upstream of the plants and two were located downstream. 
229 
Approximately 1.46 m from the channel head, the spacers were spaced at 0.75 m.

The four discharges used in this study were 2, 4, 8 and 11 L.s-1.m-1 at ± 7%. The tested 
233 
discharges are observed approximately every 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, in 5 ha 
234 
catchments in the European loess belt with a 5 m-wide thalweg, as precised by Richet et 
235 
al. (2017). Both upstream and downstream discharges were continuously monitored. 
236 
Water level were measured when the upstream and downstream discharges were 
237 
equivalent. No infiltration occurred as the soil in the plots was saturated in water. The 
238 
backwater and downstream flow levels were measured using the spacers as elevation-
239 
known baselines. The levels were determined by measuring the distance between the top 
240 
of the water flow and the spacer every 10 cm from the edges of the channel, corresponding 
241 
to seven vertical profiles.  
242 
To express the hydraulic resistance related to the plant presence, we used the unit stream 
243 
power (USP), a sediment transport capacity index (Govers, 1992; Yang, 1972). USP is 
244 
defined as the “energy dissipation per unit of time and per unit of weight of the flow” 
245 
(Govers, 1992), depending on its velocity and the slope:  
246 
USP = V S 
(1) 
247 
where USP is expressed in m.s-1, V is the mean velocity (m.s-1), and S is the channel slope 
248 
(m.m-1) (Cao et al., 2015; Hessel et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 1998). The lower the USP is, 
249 
the greater the hydraulic roughness will be. The mean velocity was calculated using the 
250 
water levels measured at the closest spacer upstream of the plot. Govers (1990) 
251 
determined a USP critical value of 0.004 m.s-1 that indicates that the threshold from which 
252 
soil is most likely to erode in the loamy soils found in the European loess belt. Govers 
253 
(1990) established this critical value for bare loess soils with a D50 from 58 µm to 218 
254 
µm, at slopes ranging from 1° to 8° and for discharges varying from 0.2 to 10 L.s-1.m-1. 
255 
The USP, Manning coefficients and backwater depths are presented in Appendix B.

2.4. Data analysis  
258 
Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to examine the link between each 
259 
trait. Data used for the PCA included the measured traits in the two quadrats within the 
260 
plots. Generalised linear models (GLM) for the inverse-link gamma family were then 
261 
processed to examine the effect of plant morphological traits on the USP at each 
262 
discharge.  
263 
Another analysis using GLMs were then used to analyse the relationship between the USP 
264 
and the significant traits and density-weighted traits identified in the previous step 
265 
between 0 and 10 cm. These models were run separately for each discharge to highlight 
266 
differences of trait effects among the discharge levels. To avoid autocorrelation within 
267 
the models, traits and density-weighted traits were processed in separate models. Due to 
268 
the small sample size n and ratio n/K < 40 (where K the number of parameters used in the 
269 
models), second order Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and ∆AICc were used to 
270 
assess the model performance, as recommended in Burnham and Anderson (2002). 
271 
∆AICc is the difference between the AICc of a model i and the model with the lowest 
272 
AICc (also characterised as the best model fit). Burnham and Anderson (2002) recognise 
273 
the models with a ∆AICc < 2 as models with substantial support, which are identified as 
274 
the best model fits in this study. Models with ∆AICc varying between 2 and 7, indicating 
275 
less support, were also analysed as recommended by Burnham et al. (2011). Akaike 
276 
weights (wAICc) were used in this study to assess the relative likelihood of the models, 
277 
as this indicates the probability of a model i being the best among the set of tested models 
278 
(Brown et al., 2011; Burnham and Anderson, 2002). 
279 
All the data in this study were analysed using the statistical software R (version 3.3.2).

3. Results 
282 
3.1. Variations of plant morphological traits 
283 
Covariation among the seven traits of the 14 species studied were analysed using a PCA 
284 
(Fig. 2), which showed that the first two principal components explained 71.9% of the 
285 
variance. The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 47% of the total variance 
286 
and was associated with the projected stem area, the stem diameter and the stem density. 
287 
The variance of PC1 was explained by the leaf area, the stem specific density and the 
288 
specific leaf area. Two groups of variables were observed along the PC1 axis: the 
289 
projected stem area and the stem diameter on the positive end and the stem density on the 
290 
negative end. The second principal component (PC2) accounted for 24.9% of the total 
291 
variance and was explained by the stem dry matter content, which was found on the 
292 
negative end of the axis. The variance of PC2 was explained by the leaf density and the 
293 
stem height.

3.2. Effect of morphological traits on the Unit Stream Power 
304 
The effects of traits on hydraulic roughness were analysed using GLMs to show the traits 
305 
affecting the USP at each discharge (Table 3). The leaf densities (0-5 cm and 0-10 cm) 
306 
were correlated to the USP for the four discharge levels. The leaf area had a significant 
307 
relationship with the USP at discharges Q1 and Q2, while the leaf density (0-20 cm) was 
308 
significant with the USP at discharges Q3 and Q4. The weighted leaf area (0-5 cm, 0-10 
309 
cm and 0-20 cm), the weighted projected stem area (0-5 cm, 0-10 cm and 0-20 cm), the 
310 
weighted stem diameter (0-5 cm, 0-10 cm and 0-20 cm) and the weighted SLA (0-5 cm) 
311 
were correlated to the USP at discharges Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. The weighted SLA (0-10 
312 
cm) influenced the USP at discharges Q2, Q3 and Q4.

From the results in Table 3, GLMs were used to highlight traits and density-weighted 
323 
traits (0-10 cm) that have a greater impact on the USP within the traits previously 
324 
identified as significantly impacting the USP (Fig 3, Table 4, Table 5). The GLMs for 
325 
single traits (Table 4) highlighted that the combination of leaf area and leaf density was 
326 
the best model fit for all discharges (wAICc > 0.50), although the leaf density was also a 
327 
good fit for the data at discharges Q3 and Q4 (wAICc = 0.39 and wAICc = 0.34, 
328 
respectively). The results of the density-weighted trait GLMs (Table 5) showed that 
329 
models USP ~ WLA + WSA and USP ~ WLA + WSDm were the best fit for all 
330 
discharges, with cumulative wAICc ranging from 0.75 at discharge Q1 to 0.84 at Q4, 
331 
showing a growing significance along with the discharge gradient. However, the ranking 
332 
of importance changed with the discharges, as USP ~ WLA + WSA was greater for 
333 
discharges Q1 and Q4, USP ~ WLA + WSDm was greater for Q3 and both combinations 
334 
were equivalent for Q2.

4. Discussion 
350 
Contrary to processes of soil detachment by water flow (De Baets and Poesen, 2010; 
351 
Vannoppen et al., 2015) and sediment retention (Burylo et al., 2012), the effect of 
352 
morphological plant traits on hydraulic roughness corresponds to a lack of research to 
353 
understand the role of plant and vegetation on soil erosion. This study examined the 
354 
effects of plant morphological traits on hydraulic roughness for four discharges.  
355 
 
356 
4.1. Effect of morphological traits and density-weighted traits on hydraulic 
357 
roughness 
358 
Stem and leaf traits influenced hydraulic roughness, given that they constitute a hydraulic 
359 
brake on water flows. However, some stem and leaf traits may have a greater effect on 
360 
hydraulic roughness. This study has highlighted that, among the considered aboveground 
361 
traits involved in soil erosion (i.e., leaf area, SLA, leaf density, stem density, stem 
362 
diameter, stem specific density, projected stem area and stem dry matter content), only 
363 
the leaf area and the leaf density presented a significant effect on hydraulic roughness. 
364 
The leaf traits have a better impact on hydraulic roughness than stem traits, regarding 
365 
non-weighted traits. The GLMs showed that the combination of leaf density and leaf area 
366 
better explained the effect on hydraulic roughness than these traits alone for any discharge 
367 
used. Plant individuals with better trade-off between leaf density and leaf area, meaning 
368 
high leaf density and long leaves, such as some graminoid species, would have a great 
369 
impact on mitigating the unit stream power and thus increase hydraulic roughness. These 
370 
results are in agreement with other studies highlighting the efficiency of several 
371 
graminoid species in soil erosion mitigation (Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007; 
372 
Morgan, 2004). The absence of the stem density effect on hydraulic roughness is not in 
373 

 
27
agreement with the literature where the stem density is considered a main trait impacting 
374 
flow velocity and soil erosion (Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007; Mekonnen et al., 
375 
2016; Meyer et al., 1995; Morgan and Duzant, 2008; Temple et al., 1987). This 
376 
contradiction could be explained by the lack of a standard characterisation of all stem and 
377 
leaf traits involved in hydraulic roughness and soil erosion (e.g. defining the tillers and 
378 
pseudoculms as stems when characterising the stem density). The stem density is one of 
379 
the main traits included in hydraulic and soil erosion models such as VFSMOD (Muñoz 
380 
Carpena and Parsons, 2014) and in studies focusing on the relationship between 
381 
vegetation and hydraulic roughness or sediment retention (Morgan, 2004; Temple, 1982; 
382 
Van Dijk et al., 1996; Xiao et al., 2011), which could be improved by considering the 
383 
effect of other stem traits (e.g., stem diameter). In the trait-based approach, the importance 
384 
of stem density in the plant-hydraulic roughness relationship lays in its use in the 
385 
calculation of weighted stem trait values in the vegetation. Indeed, this approach 
386 
highlighted that mainly density-weighted traits influenced hydraulic roughness. 
387 
Specifically, all the GLMs included weighted leaf area, indicating its great importance in 
388 
the increase of hydraulic roughness. Projected stem area or stem diameter showed no 
389 
significance on the hydraulic roughness at the trait level but, by considering weighted 
390 
stem traits, weighted projected stem area and weighted stem diameter showed highly 
391 
significant effects on the unit stream power. The GLMs showed that the best fit model 
392 
was WSA + WLA (weighted projected stem area + weighted leaf area) as these traits 
393 
represent the interception area of the leaves and stems with the water flow in the 
394 
vegetation, i.e., a hydraulic brake. As the stem diameter, projected stem area and leaf area 
395 
were negatively associated with the stem density, trade-offs among these stem and leaf 
396 
traits can be considered to improve herbaceous hedge effects on hydraulic roughness. The 
397 

 
28
effect of weighted SLA, when associated with weighted leaf area and weighted stem 
398 
diameter or weighted leaf area and weighted projected stem area, was also observed (3 < 
399 
∆AICc < 5). Overall, vegetation presenting the best trade-off between stem density and 
400 
weighted stem diameter, as well as between leaf density and leaf area, will have a greater 
401 
efficiency to increase hydraulic roughness. Herbaceous hedges that present these 
402 
weighted leaf and stem traits would be partly composed of graminoid species, given that 
403 
these present large leaf density, leaf area, stem diameter and a greater hydraulic roughness 
404 
than non-graminoid species (Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007). Stem and leaf 
405 
densities should be considered to calculate weighted-traits in herbaceous hedges and 
406 
quantify the effect on soil erosion. Characterisation of trait weights in herbaceous hedges 
407 
vegetation allowed to highlight the main morphological aboveground traits and their 
408 
combinations involved in hydraulic roughness, as well as the importance of stem density 
409 
as a plant marker to examine the effect of vegetation on runoff. As a result, this trait-
410 
based approach can be effectively applied at the vegetation level to understand and model 
411 
runoff and soil erosion.  
412 
 
413 
4.2. Effects of morphological traits on hydraulic roughness depending on runoff 
414 
processes  
415 
Flow rate variations can trigger different soil-plant-water processes (Dabney et al., 2004; 
416 
Temple et al., 1987; Vieira and Dabney, 2012). The results here are consistent with the 
417 
hypothesis that the influence of aboveground traits on hydraulic roughness can change 
418 
with the discharge. The effect of leaf density (0-20 cm) and leaf area on hydraulic 
419 
roughness varied with the discharge. The results showed the importance of leaf density 
420 
in increasing hydraulic roughness at higher discharges (∆AIC < 2). However, for lower 
421 

 
29
discharges, a combination of leaf area and leaf density should be considered rather than 
422 
the traits alone. The results for the leaf area are in accordance with the one found by 
423 
Temple et al. (1987) showing a decreasing impact of the leaf structure with an increasing 
424 
discharge. At a small discharge (2 L.s-1.m-1), weighted SLA (0-10 cm) did not present an 
425 
effect on the hydraulic roughness, but a positive influence was observed at 4 L.s-1.m-1. 
426 
Differences in the influence of leaf density and weighted SLA among the discharges may 
427 
be interpreted as the water depth being too low to enter into contact with all the leaves 
428 
between 0 and 20 cm of each individual and with large SLA until 5 cm of the vegetation 
429 
at small discharges. Herbaceous hedges, playing a key role in hydraulic roughness, 
430 
presents the best trade-off between stem density and diameter, as well as leaf density and 
431 
area at low discharges, and with increasing water discharge, larger basal leaf density and 
432 
basal SLA. This study indicates that some trait and density-weighted trait effects on 
433 
hydraulic roughness are linked to the flow water level. The characterisation of these 
434 
effects according to flow depth constitutes an advance to model water flows and soil 
435 
erosion in ecosystems and landscapes.   
436 
 
437 
4.3. Consequences on sediment retention 
438 
As hydraulic roughness is linked to sediment retention and transport capacities (Dabney 
439 
et al., 2009; Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats, 2007; Lambrechts et al., 2014; Munoz-
440 
Carpena et al., 1999), plant morphological traits, which have positive effects on hydraulic 
441 
roughness, can be discussed with studies highlighting plant trait effects on sediment 
442 
retention. Indeed, results showed the positive effect of the leaf area on hydraulic 
443 
roughness, whereas there was no effect of stem specific density at small discharges, such 
444 
as 2 L.s-1.m-1, which is consistent with Burylo et al. (2012) on the sediment retention 
445 

 
30
capacity for more intense erosion processes. Results display the greater impact of density-
446 
weighted traits, which were previously not considered in studies on plant trait effects on 
447 
sediment retention. The density-weighted trait approach is therefore important in 
448 
understanding the plant-soil interaction involved in soil erosion. 
449 
Application of this trait-based approach in ecohydrology involves using the results to 
450 
manage the reduction of soil erosion. Use of the unit stream power allows to characterise 
451 
the plant efficiency with regard to sediment retention, with a critical USP (USPc) value 
452 
of 0.004 m.s-1 determined by (Govers, 1990), which indicates the threshold from which 
453 
soil is most likely to erode in loamy soils found in the European loess belt. From identified 
454 
traits and density-weighted traits presenting an effect on hydraulic roughness and their 
455 
values (USP < 0.004 m.s-1) plant species selection could be performed to create new 
456 
herbaceous ecosystems that will be efficient to reduce runoff and further sediment 
457 
retention on degraded areas (e.g., bare soils in degraded agroecosystems, urban and 
458 
mining habitats) (Fig. 3). 
459 
 
460 
5. Conclusions 
461 
This trait-based ecohydrology study allows the identification of important plant traits that 
462 
influence the hydraulic roughness. The results indicate the stronger effect of density-
463 
weighted traits, showing that communities with the best trade-offs between stem density, 
464 
diameter and leaf area are the key to mitigate soil erosion. This new knowledge in the 
465 
relationship between plant functional traits with hydraulic roughness and soil erosion 
466 
constitutes a new advancement for modelling vegetation effects on soil erosion and 
467 
creating new herbaceous ecosystems in degraded areas (e.g. bare soils of agroecosystems, 
468 
mining and urban habitats). These newly reconstructed herbaceous ecosystems will play 
469 

 
31
an important role in soil erosion mitigation. Future work should (1) include these 
470 
relationships between aboveground traits and hydraulic roughness in existing models to 
471 
estimate the transport and sediment retention capacities of flows and design herbaceous 
472 
hedges to mitigate soil erosion and (2) examine the effect of functional diversity on runoff 
473 
and soil erosion, as it could influence hydraulic roughness by ecologically complementing 
474 
aboveground biomass and, more precisely, by limiting vegetation lodging.

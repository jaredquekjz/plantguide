Abstract
Recently, a new annotation tool “FungalTraits” was created based on the previous FUNGuild and ­FunFun databases, which has 
attracted high attention in the scientific community. These databases were widely used to gain more information from fungal 
sequencing datasets by assigning fungal functional traits. More than 1500 publications so far employed FUNGuild and the aim 
of this study is to compare this successful database with the recent FungalTraits database. Quality and quantity of the assignment 
by FUNGuild and FungalTraits to a fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)–based amplicon sequencing dataset on amplicon 
sequence variants (ASVs) were addressed. Sequencing dataset was derived from leaves and needles of 12 temperate broadleaved 
and coniferous tree species. We found that FungalTraits assigned more functional traits than FUNGuild, and especially the 
coverage of saprotrophs, plant pathogens, and endophytes was higher while lichenized fungi revealed similar findings. Moreover, 
ASVs derived from leaves and needles of each tree species were better assigned to all available fungal traits as well as to 
saprotrophs by FungalTraits compared to FUNGuild in particular for broadleaved tree species. Assigned ASV richness as well as 
fungal functional community composition was higher and more diverse after analyses with FungalTraits compared to FUNGuild. 
Moreover, datasets of both databases showed similar effect of environmental factors for saprotrophs but for endophytes, unidentical 
patterns of significant corresponding factors were obtained. As a conclusion, FungalTraits is superior to FUNGuild in assigning 
a higher quantity and quality of ASVs as well as a higher frequency of significant correlations with environmental factors.

Introduction
Fungi play a pivotal role in terrestrial ecosystems and exert 
important ecological functions including decomposition, 
transformation, and effective utilization of organic sub-
strates, facilitating the cycling processes [1]. The under-
standing of fungal community diversity associated with 
leaf decomposition provides new insights into changes in 
biodiversity and forest ecosystem functions under climate 
change scenarios [2, 3]. Leaf properties (especially pH, 
availability of N and C nutrients) vary greatly among dif-
ferent host tree species and tree types and are known to 
shape the microbial community composition and micro-
bial functional groups [4–6]. However, little attention has 
been paid to the fungal community functions related to 
leaves and needles of temperate tree species [7] and their 
relation to the host tree species. A functional guild sum-
marizes a functional group composed of different phy-
logenetic taxa, which employs similar utilization of the 
same substrate type. Nevertheless, not all fungal groups 
perform consistent ecological functions, potentially 
resulting in guild bias in the relationships between the 
relative abundance of fungal communities and ecologi-
cal functions. Some fungal groups even have overlapping 
niches under certain conditions [8–10]. Less is known 
until recently on how different fungal guilds interplay in 
facilitating and competitive modes in different host tree 
species. The interaction between fungal guilds can impact 
the decomposition rate of organic matter through the prim-
ing effect (additional carbon input) or the Gadgil effect 
(competition between saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizas 
for limited organic resources) [11–13]. Saprotrophs and 
plant pathogens are the two main guilds inhabiting the 
leaf litter. Saprotrophs exert a variety of functions in for-
est debris (e.g., dead wood and leaf litter), soil carbon, 
and nutrient cycling [14], while plant pathogens usually 
exhibit saprophytic activities after leaf senescence (in the 
early stage of decomposition) [15]. These characteristics 
can lead to differences of the functional richness between 
the saprotrophs and plant pathogens in different habitats. 
Therefore, identifying and evaluating how fungal guilds 
and their richness in the respective functional diversity 
response to the variation in host tree species and diversity 
is a crucial issue for microbial ecology and biodiversity. 
The functional assignment to phylogenetic datasets is an 
important step to assess fungal community functions and 
guild differentiation.
In recent years, several relatively efficient and accurate 
databases or molecular tools that depict and identify fun-
gal functions have been established, for example LIAS [16, 
17], DEEMY [18], ­FunFun [19], Notes on genera: Ascomy-
cota [20], FUNGuild [21], and FacesOfFungi [22]. LIAS 
focuses on lichens, lichenicolous fungi, and non-lichenized 
Ascomycetes, whereas DEEMY focuses on ectomycorrhi-
zal fungi [16, 18]. FacesOfFungi is a broad database and 
includes three main fungal groups, Ascomycota, Basidi-
omycota, basal fungi as well as fungus-like organisms 
[22]. Notes on genera: Ascomycota has been built up from 
FacesOfFungi by focusing on habitats, substrates, gross 
biotic interactions, and trophic modes of Ascomycetes 
[20]. FUNGuild is a database for the comparison of fungal 
functions and can link fungal gene sequencing information 
with the ecological functions of fungi, as well as identify 
the nutrient types used by fungi at the genus level and 
conduct the specific functional classifications [21]. ­FunFun 
database has been developed from FUNGuild by addition 
of data on various number of traits at the genus and spe-
cies levels (including cellular, ecological, and biochemical 
traits) [19]. The FUNGuild annotation tool proposed by 
Nguyen et al. (2016) for analyzing the functional guilds of 
fungal communities [21] has received more attention and 
has been applied to perform the fungal ecological func-
tions in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems [23–28]. The 
script is written in Python and licensed under GNU Gen-
eral Public License. FUNGuild’s script works by matching 
terms in the taxonomy column of the OTU table to those 
in the database in the GitHub repository [21]. Even though 
FUNGuild has been used to analyze the functions of fungi 
to a certain extent, the functions of 59% of soil fungi and 
20% of saprophytic organisms have not yet been resolved 
[21]. This tool has certain limitations as it is based on 
existing literature and data. Therefore, the fungal taxon 
and functional group datasets still need to be updated with 
higher resolution.
Based on the previous fungal functional annotation 
tools, FUNGuild [21] and ­FunFun [19], the recent work by 
Põlme et al. developed the FungalTraits tool and reanno-
tated 10,210 genera of fungi and 151 genera of Strameno-
pila associated with 17 characteristic lifestyles [29]. They 
manually classified and assigned the 697,413 fungal ITS 
sequences and obtained the 92,623 fungal characteristics and 
host information (at 1% dissimilarity threshold). Compared 
with FUNGuild, FungalTraits clearly provides the most 
commonly occurring lifestyle as primary lifestyle and addi-
tional relevant lifestyle as secondary lifestyles. Furthermore, 
FungalTraits introduced the “aquatic_habitat” feature, which 
allows fungi to be classified as marine, freshwater, more 
extensive aquatic, or partial aquatic organisms, because 
many previous aquatic species were usually annotated to 
root or soil environments. They unravelled that it may be 
necessary to parse accidental spores of terrestrial fungi from 
functional groups that naturally grow in water or similar 
substrates [29]. In addition, FungalTraits has also expanded 
the “growth_form” field, with 15 characteristic states cover-
ing amoeba, filamentous, mycelium, and various single-cell

forms related to fungi and Stramepiles. For ectomycorrhizal 
fungi, the evolutionary characters “ectomycorrhiza_lineage” 
and “ectomycorrhiza_exploration_type” are introduced. In 
addition, they collected specific information about primary 
and secondary symbiotic photosynthetic organisms in the 
literature to annotated information about lichen traits [29].
Until now, more than 1500 publications (last accessed 
16.12.2021) have employed FUNGuild to annotate sequenc-
ing datasets to ecological functions. Due to the large num-
ber of previous studies using FUNGuild, it is necessary to 
compare the performance and the ecological interpretation 
provided by the two annotation tools (FUNGuild vs. Fungal-
Traits). Our study aimed to compare state-of-the-art methods 
(FungalTraits vs. FUNGuild) for leaf- and needle-associated 
fungal functional diversity analyses. We investigated the 
leaf- and needle-associated fungi of 12 temperate tree spe-
cies in Central Europe forests and validated the consistency 
of using the two functional annotation tools. We hypoth-
esize that (1) for overall and for all main fungal guilds, 
FungalTraits outperforms FUNGuild as it contains a higher 
number of fungal genera in its database; (2) both functional 
annotation tools provide consistent results for interpreting 
the richness and community composition of the leaf- and 
needle-associated fungi across 12 temperate tree species.
Materials and Methods
Study Site and Sampling
This study was conducted in the Hainich-Dün region of 
Thuringia, Germany (51°12' N 10°18'E). Elevations range 
from 100 to 494 m above sea level, the mean annual pre-
cipitations from 600 to 800 mm, and the mean annual tem-
peratures from 6 to 7.5 °C (average temperatures in Janu-
ary = 0.65 °C and July = 17.17 °C). The parent material is 
Triassic limestone, which is covered by a Pleistocene loess 
layer of variable thickness (ca. 10–50 cm) at most sites. The 
litter layer consists mainly of past years foliage (1 to 3 cm). 
The main soil type is a Cambisol on limestone as bed-rock. 
The soil pH is weakly acidic (5.1 ± 1.1; mean ± SD).
In October 2019, we collected senescing leaves and 
needles from 60 tree individual (12 tree species, five true 
replicates (trees), minimum 200-g leaves or needles per 
tree individual). These tree species include 8 broadleaved 
(including Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Fagus 
sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Populus sp., Prunus avium, 
Quercus robur, and Tilia cordata) and 4 coniferous tree spe-
cies (including Picea abies, Larix decidua, Pinus sylvestris, 
and Pseudotsuga menziesii). Sampling was carried out with 
gloves and sterilized plastic bags, and leaves and needles 
from each tree were separately packed and transported under 
cooled conditions to the lab. In the laboratory, each leaf 
and needle were frozen at − 80 °C for subsequent molecular 
approaches.
DNA Extraction and Illumina Sequencing
Healthy-looking leaves (up to 10 leaves per tree individual 
depending on the size of the leaves) and needles (from five 
branches per tree individual) were subsampled and prepared 
for DNA extraction. Briefly, we removed loosely adherent 
dust particles and microbes from leaf and needle samples by 
vortexing them with a maximum speed for 5 min in sterile 
Tween solution (0.1% vol/vol), and this step was repeated 
three times. The samples were then washed three to five 
times using deionized water. Finally, leaf and needle samples 
were incubated for 1 h in sterile water at room tempera-
ture. Each composite sample was then ground using liquid 
nitrogen and pestle, homogenized, then stored at − 20 °C 
for further analysis. Fungal community attached firmly to 
the leaf and needle samples (~ 120 mg homogenized leaves 
and needles) was then subjected to DNA extraction using 
DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and a 
Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Mon-
tigny-le-Bretonneux, France) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The presence and quantity of genomic 
DNA were checked using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectropho-
tometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany), and 
the extracts were stored at − 20 °C. Leaf- and needle-associ-
ated fungi were characterized by fungal internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS)–based amplicon sequencing on the Illumina 
MiSeq sequencing platform, as outlined earlier [30]. For 
establishing fungal amplicon libraries, the fungal ITS2 gene 
was amplified using the fungal primer pair fITS7 [5-GTG​
ART​CAT​CGA​ATC​TTT​G-3] [31] and ITS4 primer [5-TCC​
TCC​GCT​TAT​TGA​TAT​GC-3] [32] with Illumina adapter 
sequences. Amplifications were performed using 20-µL 
reaction volumes with 5 × HOT FIRE Pol Blend Master 
Mix (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia). The amplified products 
were visualized by gel electrophoresis and purified using 
an Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, 
Germany). Illumina Nextera XT Indices were added to both 
ends of fungal amplicons. The products from three techni-
cal replicates were then pooled in equimolar concentrations. 
Paired-end sequencing (2 × 300 bp) was performed on the 
pooled PCR products using a MiSeq Reagent kit v3 on an 
Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) 
at the Department of Soil Ecology, Helmholtz Centre for 
Environmental Research, Germany.
Bioinformatics
The ITS rDNA sequences corresponding to the forward 
and reverse primers were trimmed from the demultiplexed 
raw reads using cutadapt [33]. Paired-end sequences were

quality-trimmed, filtered for chimeras, and merged using 
the DADA2 package [34] through the pipeline dadasnake 
[30]. Assembled reads fulfilling the following criteria were 
retained for further analyses: a minimum length of 70 nt, 
quality scores at least equal to 9 with maximum expected 
error score of 5 for forward and reverse sequences, and no 
ambiguous nucleotides. Merging was conducted with 2 
mismatches allowed and a minimum overlap of 20 nucleo-
tides required for fungal sequences. High-quality reads were 
clustered into 2480 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) for 
fungi after chimera removal. Fungal ASVs were classified 
against the UNITE v7.2 database [35]. Set of ASVs were 
classified using the Bayesian classifier as implemented in 
the mothur classify.seqs command, with a cut-off of 60. The 
ASV method is used to infer the biological sequences in the 
sample, as described previously [36]. Rare ASVs (single-
tons), which potentially represent artificial sequences, were 
removed. The dataset was then rarefied. Finally, we obtained 
2451 rarefied fungal ASVs with the minimum sequencing 
depths of 21,967 sequences per sample. Presence/Absence 
datasets for fungi were used in the statistical analyses. The 
rarefaction curves of all the samples are provided in the Sup-
plementary Figure S1. The fungal ecological function of 
each ASV was determined using FUNGuild [21] and Fun-
galTraits [29] according to the authors’ instructions.
Physiochemical analyses
Wet leaf and needle samples were shaken for 1 h in falcon 
tubes with 30 mL milliQ water to leach water-soluble com-
ponents from their surfaces. The leachates were centrifuged 
for 5 min at 3500 rpm, decanted, and filtered through pre-
flushed 0.45-µm regenerated cellulose syringe filters. The 
remaining leaf/needle material was dried for two weeks at 
40 °C for dry weight determination. All quantification results 
are given in reference to the dry weight. The pH of the lea-
chates was determined using pH paper with a scale precision 
of 0.2 pH units. ­Norg was calculated as the difference: 
­Norg = ­TNb – ­Nmin. ­TNb was analyzed using a sum parameter 
analyzer with high temperature combustion and chemilumi-
nescence detection (Mitsubishi TN-100; a1 envirosciences, 
Düsseldorf, Germany). For ­NMin quantification, a flow injec-
tion analyzer (Quikchem QC85S5; Lachat Instruments, 
Hach Company, Loveland CO, USA) with corresponding 
manifolds for the nitrogen measurement of ammonium NNH+
4 , 
nitrite NNO−
2 , and nitrate- plus nitrite NNO−
3 +NO−
2 was used. 
DOC was quantified as non-purgeable organic carbon 
(NPOC) with a sum parameter analyzer using high-temper-
ature combustion and infrared detection (vario TOC cube, 
Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Langenselbold, Ger-
many). Nutrient ions, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, and P content were 
determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical 
Emission Spectrometry (ICP–OES, PerkinElmer Inc., 
Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturers’ specifica-
tions. All method details on physiochemical analyses are 
provided in supplementary material.
Statistical analysis
The datasets were tested for normality using the Jarque–Bera 
JB test and for the equality of group variances using F-test 
(for two datasets) and Levene’s test (for more than two 
datasets). The statistical differences between proportions 
of functional assignment by FUNGuild and FungalTraits 
were performed using T-test (for normal distributed data) 
and Mann–Whitney U test (for non-normal distributed 
data). Effects of tree species and tree types on fungal com-
munity composition were visualized and tested with clus-
ter analysis (based on presence-absence data, paired group 
algorithms, and the Jaccard distance measure) and one-way 
PERMANOVA (based on presence-absence data and the 
Jaccard distance measure), over 999 permutations were 
run. The correlation analyses were performed using Pear-
son’s r (for normal distributed data) and Spearman’ ρ (for 
non-normal distributed data). The statistical differences of 
ASV richness among different tree species were performed 
using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test or KW 
test with Mann–Whitney U test. All statistical analyses were 
performed using PAST version 2.17 [37].
Results
Overall Performances of Ecological Function 
Assignments of FUNGuild and FungalTraits
In total, we assigned functions to 1,395 ASVs (accounted for 
57% of total ASVs) using both FUNGuild and FungalTraits 
annotation tools (Table 1 and Fig. 1). In these total assigned 
ASVs, 70% and 89% were assigned functions by FUNGuild 
and FungalTraits, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). The 
remaining 30% that were not assigned functions by FUN-
Guild were assigned solely by FungalTraits and vice versa. 
977 ASVs (~ 40% of total ASVs) could not functionally be 
assigned by both FUNGuild and FungalTraits. As suggested 
by Nguyen et al. [21], genera with confidence level of “pos-
sible” (in total 349 ASVs) were classified as “uncertained” 
and excluded from the functional analyses in this study 
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Overall, we found 
that the proportion of the total fungal functional assignment 
by FungalTraits (average of all tree species = 60%) was sig-
nificantly higher than those by FUNGuild (average of all 
tree species = 43%) (Fig. 1a). We found a consistent pattern 
when considering each fungal guild (including saprotroph, 
plant pathogen, and endophyte) (Fig. 1b–d). The proportions

of the functional assignment of these fungal guilds by Fun-
galTraits were also significantly higher than those by FUN-
Guild, especially for saprotrophs (FungalTraits = 30% and 
FUNGuild = 14%), plant pathogens (FungalTraits = 20% and 
FUNGuild = 10%), and endophytes (FungalTraits = 0.24% 
and FUNGuild = 0.08%). Considering main fungal guilds, 
FUNGuild assigned only 53 and 51% of plant pathogens and 
saprotrophs, respectively. Contrarily, FungalTraits assigned 
up to 99% of these main fungal guilds. Furthermore, 98 
and 79% of plant pathogens and saprotrophs, respectively, 
assigned by FUNGuild were also assigned by FungalTraits. 
However, for lichenized fungi, we found no significant dif-
ference between the proportions of functional assignment 
by both annotation tools (P > 0.05) (Fig. 1e). FUNGuild and 
FungalTraits shared 88% of total lichenized fungal ASVs. 
Remarkedly, all ASVs assigned functions such as animal 
pathogen/animal parasite, ectomycorrhiza, fungal parasite/
mycoparasite, and lichen parasite by FUNGuild were subset 
of those assigned by FungalTraits (Table 1). Epiphyte was, 
however, an exception. There was no shared epiphytic ASV 
between both annotation tools.
Specific Performances of Ecological Function 
Assignments of FUNGuild and FungalTraits Across 
12 Temperate Tree Species
Based on individual tree species, we also found that Fun-
galTraits provided a significantly higher proportion of the 
total fungal functional assignment compared to FUNGuild 
(Fig. 2). This pattern was consistent across all 12 tree spe-
cies. Among broadleaved tree species, Populus sp. revealed 
the highest proportion of the total fungal functional assign-
ments by FungalTraits, whereas F. sylvatica has the low-
est proportion (Figs. 1 and 2). Remarkably, the differences 
between these proportions assigned by both annotation tools 
were much higher in broadleaved tree species compared to 
coniferous tree species. The highest difference was found 
in broadleaved Populus sp. (31%), while the lowest differ-
ence was observed for P. abies (7%). While the proportions 
of overall fungal functional assignments by FungalTraits 
were much higher in broadleaved tree species compared to 
coniferous tree species, FUNGuild provided similar propor-
tions across all tree species. The consistent patterns were 
found in saprotrophs. The proportions of saprotrophic fungal 
functional assignments by FungalTraits were significantly 
higher than those by FUNGuild across 12 tree species. The 
differences between them were also higher in broadleaved 
tree species (13–24%) compared to coniferous tree species 
(7–18%).

FungalTraits (Pearson’s r = 0.62, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3a). How-
ever, the correlations were different among fungal guilds. 
We found that lichenized fungi revealed the highest signifi-
cant correlation between proportions of functional assign-
ment by FUNGuild and FungalTraits (ρ = 0.96, P < 0.001), 
followed by plant pathogens (Pearson’s r = 0.80, P < 0.001). 
A significant, but lower correlation, was found for sapro-
trophs (Pearson’s r = 0.63, P < 0.001). Contrarily, no cor-
relation was observed for endophytes (P > 0.05).
Likewise, the consistent results of the effect of tree spe-
cies and tree types (broadleaved vs. coniferous trees) on rich-
ness and community composition were highly correlated to 
fungal guilds (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). For lichenized fungi, such 
results from FUNGuild and FungalTraits are almost identi-
cal. We found that needles of all coniferous trees harboured 
significantly higher richness of lichenized fungi as compared 
to the broadleaved trees (Fig. 4). An exception was found 
for Q. robur, which exhibited similar richness as compared 
with L. decidua, P. sylvestris, and P. menziesii. Picea abies 
and Populus sp. harboured highest and lowest richness. For 
fungal community composition, we found that almost all 
needle samples of coniferous trees clustered together into 
one clade with few broadleaved trees (Fig. 5). The majority 
of leaf samples from broadleaved trees (Populus sp., A. pseu-
doplatanus, F. sylvatica, T. cordata) contained no lichenized 
fungi and clustered together on the left side of the plot. The 
effects of tree species (Ftree species, FG = 1.52, P = 0.0001 
and Ftree species, FT = 1.52, P = 0.0001, respectively) and tree 
types (Ftree type, FG = 3.29, P = 0.0001 and Ftree type, FT = 3.32, 
P = 0.0001, respectively) on lichenized fungal community 
composition based on FUNGuild and FungalTraits were 
almost identical.
On the other hand, for saprotrophs, the results from FUN-
Guild and FungalTraits were partly inconsistent (Figs. 4 
and 6). Both functional annotation tools showed that tree 
species and tree types significantly affect the richness of 
saprotrophic fungi and Populus sp. harboured the lowest 
richness. However, FUNGuild and FungalTraits showed 
that A. pseudoplatanus and F. excelsior, respectively, har-
boured the highest saprotrophic richness (Fig. 4). Neverthe-
less, we found strong correlations for all tree species of both 
saprotrophic (Pearson’s r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and lichenized 
(ρ = 0.96, P < 0.001) fungal richness obtained by FUNGuild 
and FungalTraits (Fig. 4e and f). For saprotrophic fungal 
community composition derived from FUNGuild and Fun-
galTraits, we found that all leaf samples of coniferous trees 
separated from broadleaved trees (Fig. 6). However, based 
on FUNGuild, we detected two clades belong to broadleaved 
trees (Populus sp. separated from other broadleaved trees) 
and two clades belong to coniferous trees (L. decidua sepa-
rated from other coniferous trees) (Fig. 6a) whereas based 
on FungalTraits, we detected two clades, each belonged to 
coniferous and broadleaved trees (one Populus sp. sample 
separated from other trees) (Fig. 6b).
FUNGuild vs. FungalTraits: Factors Shaping 
Community Composition of Main Fungal Guilds
We found similar patterns of factors shaping the saprotrophic 
community composition derived from FUNGuild and Fun-
galTraits. Here, tree species and tree type were the main 
factors shaping the saprotrophic community composi-
tion (Table 2). Besides tree species and tree type, we also 
found that water content, the majority of water-leachable 
leaf/needle nutrient compounds (DOC, organic ­(NOrg) and 
inorganic (mineralized) N ­(NMin, NNH+
4 , and NNO−
2 ) as well as 
Ca, Fe, Mg, and P content), and location significantly cor-
responded with saprotrophic community composition of 
both annotation tools (Table 2). In the endophytic commu-
nity, where no correlation between proportions of functional 
assignment by FUNGuild and FungalTraits was detected, 
unidentical patterns of factors were found (Table 2). Tree 
species was the main factor shaping endophytic community 
composition of both annotation tools along with P content. 
However, when FUNGuild was employed, we obtained lon-
gitude as another main factor significantly corresponded 
with endophytic community composition. On the other hand, 
when FungalTraits was applied, Ca and K content were 
found to be additional factors that significantly corresponded 
with endophytic community composition (Table 2).
Variation partitioning analysis revealed similar results for 
saprotrophs derived from both FUNGuild and FungalTraits 
(Supplementary Table S2). Tree species alone explained the 
largest variation (45% of total explainable variance) in the 
saprotrophic community composition of both annotation 
tools, followed by leaf/needle nutrients (FUNGuild: 6% and 
FungalTraits: 3% of total explainable variance). Water con-
tent/pH and location alone did not explain the saprotrophic 
community compositions. The combinations of these factors 
revealed similar percentage of total explainable variance in 
saprotrophic community composition of both annotation 
tools. In the endophytic community composition obtained 
from FUNGuild, tree species, leaf/needle nutrients, loca-
tion, and the combination of these three factors explained 
46%, 26%, 18%, and 10%, respectively, of total explainable 
variance (Supplementary Table S2). In the endophytic com-
munity composition obtained from FungalTraits, only two 
factors (tree species and leaf/needle nutrients) were used to

Discussion
Performance of Ecological Function Assignments 
of FUNGuild and FungalTraits
FUNGuild has been routinely used for functional annota-
tions of mycobiome members across different ecosystems 
and biomes encompassing both terrestrial and aquatic 
environments [23, 38–42]. Many studies detected specific 
responses of a defined set of fungal guilds to different envi-
ronmental factors which cannot be detected based on the 
total community analyses [40, 43]. A recent study based 
on total and active microbiome also illustrates that some 
ecosystem functions are related to the changes in richness, 
abundances, and community composition of specific fungal 
guilds [39]. While FUNGuild is based on a publicly avail-
able Python script to annotate fungal functions, Fungal-
Traits works in similar way with the same Python script 
but offers a more user-friendly Excel-based database and 
a web-based interface for users without Python expertise 
[29]. As FungalTraits proof-checked all entries from FUN-
Guild and included a large set of additional entries, the 
database FungalTraits encompasses a more comprehensive 
and faster annotation. FungalTraits receives high attention 
in the scientific community and has been already applied for 
investigating fungal guilds in some terrestrial ecosystems 
[44, 45]. Due to the large number of previous studies using 
FUNGuild, it is necessary to compare the performance and 
the ecological interpretation provided by these two annota-
tion tools with high scientific reputation. FungalTraits has 
been applied together with FUNGuild to annotate func-
tional groups of fungi associated with Orchidaceae [45]. 
The authors of that study successfully demonstrated sym-
biont switching and shifts of trophic mode of fungi associ-
ated with Orchidaceae. FungalTraits was also successfully 
applied to annotate the fungal guilds for wood-inhabiting 
fungi [44]. In this current study, we used the data on myco-
biome associated with senescing leaves and needles of 12 
temperate tree species to compare the performance and the 
results obtained by FUNGuild and FungalTraits. Our results 
clearly show that FungalTraits outperforms FUNGuild in 
terms of percent functional assignment quantity and quality. 
The average value of percent functional assignment of Fun-
galTraits reaches 60% and in Populus sp., such value reaches 
76%. The average value of percent functional assignment of 
FUNGuild is 43% (ranging from 38–46%). These values are 
consistent with the percentage points of functional assign-
ment of FUNGuild reported before in many publications 
[39, 46, 47]. Nevertheless, it is known that the percentage 
points of functional assignments of taxonomically dependent 
functional annotation tool highly depends on the quality and 
quantity of the database backbone of each sequence data, 
taxonomic identification and functional description [48]. 
The better performance of FungalTraits is not surprising as 
it contains a higher number of fungal genera in its database 
than FUNGuild [21, 29]. Interestingly, we found that the val-
ues of percentage points of functional assignments are rela-
tively constant across different tree species when FUNGuild 
is applied, such value varied greatly when FungalTraits is 
applied. Furthermore, for FungalTraits-derived datasets, the 
percentage points of functional assignments are higher for 
deciduous trees (including broadleaved trees and L. decidua) 
and lower for the remaining coniferous trees (Fig. 2).
FUNGuild vs. FungalTraits: There Are Some 
Similarities but also Some Differences
Our current study demonstrates that the quality of functional 
annotations and the resulting interpretations derived from 
FUNGuild and FungalTraits are relatively similar; however, 
they are not identical. Furthermore, the degrees of similar-
ity greatly depend on which fungal guilds were considered. 
While the results on the effect of tree species and tree types 
on richness and community composition of lichenized fungi 
are almost identical when FUNGuild and FungalTraits are 
applied, for saprotrophic fungi, we could detect some dis-
crepancies between these two annotation tools (Fig. 3). Low 
discrepancies are expected for plant pathogens as correla-
tions between proportions of percentage points of functional 
assignments of FUNGuild and FungalTraits are high. In 
contrast, we expected high discrepancies for endophytes 
as we detected no correlation (Fig. 3). Such discrepancies 
derive from the fact that there are mismatches of functional 
assignments between FUNGuild and FungalTraits. We now 
identified these mismatches for fungal genera associated 
with our datasets (Supplementary Table S3–S6). For exam-
ple, the genus Fusarium was assigned to “plant pathogen” 
as a primary function in FungalTraits. In turn, FUNGuild 
assigned Fusarium to “Animal Pathogen-Endophyte-Lichen

parasite-Plant Pathogen-Soil Saprotroph-Wood Saprotroph” 
with confidence level “possible”. According to the original 
FUNGuild article, function with confidence level “possible” 
should be excluded or interpreted with caution. Confidence 
level “possible” in FUNGuild may contain genera with split 
ecologies (they perform different or even conflicting func-
tions depending on life stage and environmental conditions). 
Another example for the mismatch is the identification of 
genus Cenangium. Cenangium is classified as “foliar endo-
phyte” in FungalTraits, while it is identified as “saprotroph” 
with confidence level “probable” in FUNGuild. According 
to recent research, Cenangium was identified as endophyte, 
saprotroph, and plant pathogen [49, 50], which is consistent 
with the “Comment on lifestyle” in FungalTraits [29].
Apart from mismatches, FUNGuild identified two or 
more functions (with confidence level “probable”) for a 
single fungal taxon; thus, it is difficult to make decision 
which function or both functions are most likely fitting to 
this fungus. Nevertheless, it is quite common to report all 
functions obtained by FUNGuild for a single taxon when the 
confidence level is at least “probable”. Another possibility 
for the discrepancy is that FUNGuild can annotate functions 
to fungi at a higher taxonomic rank (such as family). For 
example, we found that four fungal ASVs belonged to Pan-
nariaceae, Candelariaceae, and Ramalinaceae, which were 
annotated as lichenized fungi using FUNGuild (with prob-
able and highly probable confidence levels), but the same 
ASVs cannot be annotated to any function by FungalTraits. 
As demonstrated before, FUNGuild and FungalTraits can 
be applied together to maximize the number of fungal func-
tional annotations and to remove ambiguous annotations. 
However, based on the results of our datasets, FungalTraits 
alone already yielded successful functional assignments for 
high proportions of the fungal community. Adding the func-
tions specifically annotate with FUNGuild to the Fungal-
Traits datasets can increase the percentage points of the total 
functional assignment by approximately 6%. Apart from the 
primary lifestyle (function), FungalTraits also provides other 
interesting information on secondary lifestyle, endophytic 
interaction capability, plant pathogenic capacity, preferred 
substrate type, decay type, habitat characteristics, animal 
biotrophic capacity, hosts, growth form, fruitbody type, 
Hymenium type, ectomycorrhiza exploration type, ectomy-
corrhizal lineage, and photobiont.
FUNGuild vs. FungalTraits: Factors Shaping 
Community Composition of Main Fungal Guilds
Saprotrophic fungi are among the most important fungal 
groups driving important ecosystem functions such as accel-
erating the decomposition rate, enabling the nutrients acces-
sibility and availability for themselves and other microbes 
[51, 52]. FungalTraits assigns substantially higher number 
of saprotrophic ASVs (89% of the total assigned sapro-
trophic ASVs) compared to FUNGuild (51% of the total 
assigned saprotrophic ASVs). The shared ASVs assigned by 
both annotation tools account to only ~ 41% of the total 
assigned saprotrophic ASVs and only moderate correlation 
is obtained (Pearson’s r = 0.63, P < 0.001). This is due to the 
reannotation process of the fungal genera in FungalTraits. 
Some changes are made to some specific fungal genera by 
the experts of the field during this process. Nevertheless, we 
detect similar patterns of factors that shape the saprotrophic 
community composition derived from both annotation tools. 
In both datasets, we found that tree species and tree type are 
the main factors that significantly shape saprotrophic com-
munity composition, along with water content and nutrients 
(water-leachable DOC amount, water-leachable organic and 
inorganic nitrogen species ( NNH+
4 , NNO−
2 , ­NMin, ­NOrg), Ca, Fe, 
Mg, and P content), and location. These findings are in line 
with previously published studies [53, 54]. The microbial 
macronutrients (such as C, N, and Ca) and transition metal 
(Fe) have been previously reported to shape the fungal com-
munity in different forest management practices [53]. These 
nutrients are essential elements in macromolecules and also 
required for many important enzymatic and metabolic pro-
cesses which are important for microbial growth and activity 
[53]. In contrast to the results of saprotrophs, the shared 
ASVs of endophytes account only to 11% of the total 
assigned endophytic ASVs and no correlation is observed. 
Longitude is an additional main factor shaping the endo-
phytic community composition of FUNGuild, while Ca and 
K content solely significantly correspond with those of Fun-
galTraits. The different patterns of significant factors might 
lead to a different ecological interpretation of endophytes.
Unexpected High Diversity of Lichens Associated 
with Senescing Leaves and Needles: Implication 
and Future Study
In this study, we revealed a high diversity of lichens associ-
ated with senescing leaves and needles assigned by both 
FUNGuild and FungalTraits. In total, we are able to assign 
60 lichenized fungal ASVs that were assigned to 21 genera. 
The proportion of lichenized fungal assignments obtained 
from both annotation tools is highly correlated and shared 
ASVs account to ~ 88% of the total assigned lichenized 
fungal ASVs. FUNGuild provides six more lichenized fun-
gal ASV assignments compared to those of FungalTraits. 
Among these, four ASVs are not identified at genus level 
and functions are only assigned on family level. We found 
a potential controversial issue for the functional assignment 
of the genus Sphaerulina as FUNGuild classifies Sphaer-
ulina as lichenized fungi with the confidence level “highly 
probable”, while FungalTraits assigns in the primary and

secondary lifestyles of this genus as “saprotroph” and “plant 
pathogen”, respectively. A recent study, however, reports 
Sphaerulina as lichenicolous fungi [55], while other studies 
attributed them as plant pathogen [56, 57]. Therefore, careful 
double and crosschecking with published datasets is manda-
tory to verify database outputs especially at low confidence

level. FUNGuild provided information on growth morphol-
ogy and habitat, while FungalTraits additionally provided 
information on fruitbody type, hymenium type, and primary 
photobiont of the assigned lichens. Most of the lichens (55 
out of 60 ASVs) detected in this study are associated with 
senescing needles of coniferous tree species (Supplementary 
Table S1). We observed lichens on the branches of all conif-
erous tree species used in this study. Our work showed that 
lichens associated with senescing leaves and needles were 
both foliicolous lichens (their development starts directly on 
leaves or needles) and lichens that accidentally grow onto 
the leaves or needles from the bark of adjacent branches 
(their development does not start on leaves or needles) [58]. 
This current work sheds light solely on richness of lichens 
as influenced by tree species and tree types. Future studies 
should focus on the effects of tree species, tree types, leaf/
needle physicochemical properties, and geographical dis-
tances on richness and community composition of lichens.
FUNGuild vs. FungalTraits: Similarities 
and Differences of the Assignments of Arbuscular 
and Ectomycorrhizal Fungi
Our present study emphasizes on the functional assignments 
and the performances of the annotation tools, FUNGuild and 
FungalTraits, in the leaf/needle-associated fungal communi-
ties. However, in nature, mycorrhizal fungi are also consid-
ered as important functional groups associated with plants 
and play crucial role in promoting their performances [59, 
60]. Thus, for the sake of completeness, we further evalu-
ate the functional assignment of arbuscular (AMF) and 
ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi using FUNGuild [21] and 
FungalTraits [29]. As AMF are mostly derived from the 
phylum Glomeromycota, we simply compare all 51 AMF 
genera from both annotation tools. All assigned AMF gen-
era are covered by FungalTraits alone and 20 AMF genera 
from FungalTraits are absent from the FUNGuild database 
(Supplementary Table S7). These new 20 AMF genera 
are erected in previous studies published between the year 
2018 and 2019 [61–64]. However, FUNGuild assigns AMF 
already at family, order, and phylum level (Glomeromycota). 
For the analysis of EcM, we employ a dataset from a recently 
published study investigating EcM in soils at different eleva-
tion levels (830 and 1300 m a.s.l) [65]. We assign 26 EcM 
genera by both annotation tools. FungalTraits covers all 26 
EcM genera and FUNGuild assigns 25 EcM genera (Supple-
mentary Figure S2). The fungal genus, Pustularia, cannot be 
assigned to the ecological function by FUNGuild. Members

of this genus were previously reported as EcM [66, 67]. Nev-
ertheless, both annotation tools refer to the same ecological 
interpretation (Supplementary Figure S2). The richness and 
community composition of EcM significantly differ at dif-
ferent elevation levels. On the basis of this information, we 
conclude that the performances of FUNGuild and Fungal-
Traits in assigning AMF and EcM are not different.
Conclusions
Functional assignment of fungal amplicon sequencing 
datasets is of pivotal interest to infer a more mechanistic 
understanding of phylogenetic information and to ease the 
assessment of ecosystem processes of the respective habitat. 
The quantity and quality of fungal functional annotations 
were significantly better in FungalTraits than in FunGuild 
for evaluating the functional guilds on senescing leaves and 
needles of 12 temperate tree species. The transferability to 
other environments and research tasks should be addressed 
in upcoming studies.

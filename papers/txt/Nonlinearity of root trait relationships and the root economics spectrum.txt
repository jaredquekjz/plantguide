The root economics spectrum (RES), a common hypothesis postulating a tradeoff between
resource acquisition and conservation traits, is being challenged by conﬂicting relationships
between root diameter, tissue density (RTD) and root nitrogen concentration (RN). Here, we
analyze a global trait dataset of absorptive roots for over 800 plant species. For woody
species (but not for non-woody species), we ﬁnd nonlinear relationships between root dia-
meter and RTD and RN, which stem from the allometric relationship between stele and
cortical tissues. These nonlinear relationships explain how sampling bias from different ends
of the nonlinear curves can result in conﬂicting trait relationships. Further, the shape of the
relationships varies depending on evolutionary context and mycorrhizal afﬁliation. Impor-
tantly, the observed nonlinear trait relationships do not support the RES predictions.
Allometry-based nonlinearity of root trait relationships improves our understanding of the
ecology, physiology and evolution of absorptive roots.

R
oot foraging is essential for plant growth and ecosystem
functioning. In most plants, the most distal and ephemeral
portion of the root systems, referred to as absorptive roots,
undertake this function1,2. Substantial interspeciﬁc trait variation
among these absorptive roots has been reported for a variety of
ecosystems and plant species pools3. One common hypothesis
explaining this variation is that roots follow a leading dimension
which reﬂects the acquisition-conservation tradeoff, i.e., the root
economics spectrum (RES)4,5. Under the RES hypothesis, roots
should follow a gradient in trait syndromes from fast foraging and
short lifespan (i.e., acquisitive strategy) to slow foraging and long
lifespan (i.e., conservative strategy). At global scales, the RES
gradient has been used to understand root tissue function and in
explaining responses of ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling to
climate change6,7.
However, recent studies have found mixed support for some of
the relationships predicted by the RES hypothesis. For instance,
root tissue density (RTD), a trait frequently used as a key RES
trait, should be positively correlated with root lifespan8,9 and
negatively correlated with root nitrogen concentration (RN), a
proxy for nutrient acquisition rate10. Root diameter is another
key trait depicting resource conservation and consistently shows a
positive correlation with root lifespan11,12. Then, under the RES
hypothesis, we would expect a positive correlation between root
diameter and RTD and a negative correlation between root dia-
meter and RN11,13. However, several studies have reported either
no or a rather weak relationship (i.e., uncorrelated traits)14–16, or
even a signiﬁcant negative relationship between root diameter
and RTD and/or a positive relationship between root diameter
and RN (i.e., correlated trait relationships)17,18. Both of these
cases contradict predictions under the RES hypothesis. The
relatively small species pools and/or the restricted geographic
ranges considered in most previous studies limit the range of trait
variation included, which could mask more universal trends. It is
therefore important to test these trait relationships using a larger
and global dataset19,20.
Another possible reason for the contrasting ﬁndings may be
that the trait relationships depart from the expected linear rela-
tionships assumed for the RES. Although nonlinear relationships
prevail in biological processes due to the relationship between
surface area and volume in functional organs21,22, they have not
been well recognized in plant roots. The two anatomical com-
ponents of absorptive roots, namely, the stele tissue and the tis-
sues outside the stele (ToS, including the epidermis, exodermis,
and cortex), follow an allometric relationship; i.e., the thickness of
the ToS (tToS) increases at a faster rate than the stele radius does
from thin to thick absorptive roots18,23,24. As such, a nonlinear
relationship exists between the proportion of root cross-sectional
area occupied by the stele (PRS) and root diameter (x): PRS =
(1–2k-2cx−1)2, where k and c are parameters for the relationship
between tToS and root diameter (i.e., tToS = kx + c, c < 0)18.
Because the stele consists of ligniﬁed vascular tissue, it should be
denser and have lower N-concentrations than the ToS; as such,
the PRS should theoretically be positively correlated with RTD
and negatively with RN25,26. Therefore, based on the above
allometric relationship, we would expect a nonlinear negative
relationship between RTD and root diameter, and a nonlinear
positive relationship between RN and root diameter.
In addition to the RES, mycorrhizal afﬁliation is also an
important factor shaping root systems and hence affecting root
trait relationships. This is because different mycorrhizas (e.g.,
arbuscular (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi) are typically
associated with particular root morphologies and nutrient con-
tents
that
are
adapted
to
speciﬁc
environmental
conditions14,15,27–29. The mantle hyphae in EM species usually
have low tissue density and have little correlation with RTD16,
and therefore cannot explain the observed differences between
EM and AM species. Instead, EM species typically dominate in
nutrient-poor soils28, which may lead to thicker and/or more
intensely ligniﬁed root cell walls30. This, in turn, could potentially
explain the higher RTD and lower RN in EM than in AM
species15,17,31,32. In addition, we predict that the morphological
modiﬁcations in cortex and/or stele tissues associated with the
switch in mycorrhizal partnership would make inter-trait rela-
tionships for EM roots deviate from those predicted by the above-
mentioned allometric relationship, and by that contribute to the
observed variation in RES trait relationships. Additionally, studies
on non-woody species tend to report stronger RES tradeoffs
between root traits than studies on woody plants (e.g., Roumet
et al.33 for non-woody plants; Holdaway et al17. and Kong et al18.
for woody plants). However, few studies have compared the two
groups of species in the same context30 with the same suit of root
traits, making generalizations about the RES difﬁcult. Testing
relationships among RES traits across mycorrhizal types and
between growth forms (i.e., woody and non-woody species) is
thus instrumental for understanding plant strategies in resource
acquisition and conservation as well as plant adaptation to dif-
ferent environments.
Here, we test the following two hypotheses: (1) Based on the
allometric relationship between stele and cortical tissue in roots,
relationships between RTD and RN, and root diameter should be
nonlinear, and consequently do not follow the predictions based
on the RES. More speciﬁcally, we expect similar nonlinear root
trait relationships between woody and non-woody species as they
both follow an allometric relationship between root stele and
cortex23. (2) Nonlinear root trait relationships are weaker for EM
than for AM plants as the harsher environments where EM
plants grow would cause greater variation of RTD and RN by
thickening and/or ligniﬁcation of root cell walls. Testing non-
linear root trait relationships advances our understanding of the
hypothesized RES, and could potentially reconcile the debate on
this topic.
Here, using a global root trait dataset over 800 species, we ﬁnd
signiﬁcant nonlinear relationships in woody but not in non-
woody species between root diameter, and RTD and RN. Non-
linearity of the root trait relationships is attributed to the allo-
metric relationship between root stele and cortical tissues and can
explain how sampling bias from different ends of the nonlinear
curves results in conﬂicting trait relationships observed in pre-
vious studies. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationships vary
depending on evolutionary context and mycorrhizal afﬁliation,
and do not support the RES predictions. Together, the allometry-
based nonlinearity of root trait relationships greatly advances our
understanding of the ecology, physiology and evolution of
absorptive roots.
Results
Allometric relationships between root anatomical structures.
The root anatomical structures of both the woody and non-
woody species followed allometric relationships for tToS (i.e.,
thickness of root tissues outside the stele) vs. root diameter and
SR (i.e., stele radius) vs. root diameter, with regression slopes for
woody species of 0.43 and 0.068 (linear regressions, p < 0.001)
and regression slopes for non-woody species of 0.32 and 0.18
(linear regressions, p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1a; regression
equations are presented in Supplementary Data 2). The regression
slope of the relationship between tToS and root diameter was
higher for woody than for non-woody species (standardized
major axis, p < 0.001), while the regression slope between SR and
root diameter was lower for woody than for non-woody species
(standardized major axis, p < 0.001).

For woody species, the PRS decreased with root diameter in a
nonlinear
way
(nonlinear
regression,
R2 = 0.27,
p < 0.001),
whereas for non-woody species, the PRS increased with root
diameter in a nonlinear way (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.33, p <
0.001) (Fig. 1b). These contrasting relationships could be
attributed to the negative intercept (−0.016) of the root diameter
vs. tToS regression for woody species and the positive intercept
(0.011) for non-woody species (Supplementary Data 2). The PRS
was positively correlated with RTD in both woody (linear
regression, R2 = 0.19, p < 0.001) and non-woody species (linear
regression, R2 = 0.53, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1c), and it was negatively
correlated with RN in woody species (linear regression, R2 = 0.14,
p < 0.001) (Fig. 1d).
Nonlinear root trait relationships. Across all species, RTD
scaled negatively and nonlinearly with root diameter (nonlinear
regression, R2 = 0.16, p < 0.001), and the nonlinear relationship
between RN and root diameter was rather weak and not sig-
niﬁcant (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.002, p > 0.1) (Fig. 2a, b;
regression equations are presented in Supplementary Data 2).
When accounting for effects of plant phylogeny for all species
using phylogenetic independent contrasts (i.e., PICs), RTD was
negatively and RN was positively correlated with root diameter,
contradicting the expected RES trends (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).
Plant growth form (i.e., woody and non-woody species) and
mycorrhizal type signiﬁcantly affected the relationship between
root diameter, RTD and RN across all species whether or not
plant phylogeny was accounted for (except for the interaction
effect of root diameter and growth form on RN in the phyloge-
netic generalized least squares analysis) (Supplementary Table 1;
Fig. 2c–f, Supplementary Fig. 2).
When considered separately, the relationships of RTD and RN
with root diameter were weak (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Fig. 1, 2;
regression equations are presented in Supplementary Data 2) and
unaffected by mycorrhizal type for non-woody species (Supple-
mentary Table 2). In contrast, for woody species, the relationships
of RTD and RN with root diameter differed among mycorrhizal
types (Supplementary Table 3; Fig. 2c, d). RTD was negatively and
nonlinearly correlated with root diameter when all woody species
were analyzed together (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.36, p < 0.001)
as well as within subsets of AM (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.34,
p < 0.001), EM, (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.39, p < 0.001) and
ERM (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.74, p < 0.001) woody species
(Fig. 2c; regression equations are presented in Supplementary
Data 2). The relationship between RN and root diameter was
negative in EM woody species (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.073,
p < 0.001) and positive in AM (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.02, p <
0.001) and ERM (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.28, p < 0.001) woody
species (Fig. 2d; regression equations are presented in Supplemen-
tary Data 2). When accounting for effects of plant phylogeny using
PICs, woody species showed a negative correlation between RTD
and root diameter and a positive correlation between RN and root
diameter (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). For woody species, the
nonlinear relationships between root diameter and RTD were
similar when the 1st order roots and roots up to the 3rd order were
analyzed separately (nonlinear regressions, R2 = 0.34 and 0.42, p <
0.001) or together (nonlinear regression, R2 = 0.36, p < 0.001),
while the nonlinear relationship between root diameter and RN
was better ﬁtted when the two root order groups were analyzed
separately (nonlinear regressions, R2 = 0.11 and 0.18, p < 0.001)
than when they were analyzed together (nonlinear regression,
R2 = 0.035, p < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 3; regression equations
are presented in Supplementary Data 2).

Phylogenetic inﬂuence on root traits. For all species, root dia-
meter, RTD and RN were all inﬂuenced by plant phylogeny, and
root diameter showed the strongest phylogenetic signal (Fig. 3;
Table 1). For example, species in the clade of Magnoliids gen-
erally had thick roots, low RTD and high RN, whereas more
recent lineages such as Rosids often showed the opposite pattern
(Fig. 3). In woody species, root diameter showed the highest
phylogenetic conservatism, while root diameter was little affected
by phylogeny in non-woody species (Table 1).
Effects of data source, root sampling, and climatic zone. For
woody species, the nonlinear relationships between RTD and root
diameter and between RN and root diameter were better ﬁtted for
studies (i.e., data sources) reporting correlated trait relationships
(i.e., negative RTD-root diameter and positive RN-root diameter
correlations), R2 = 0.30 and R2 = 0.049) than for studies report-
ing uncorrelated traits (R2 = 0.06 and R2 = 0.026) (Fig. 4;
regression equations are presented in Supplementary Data 2). The
result of a linear mixed model for woody species showed that the
data source (i.e., studies reporting correlated trait relationships vs.
studies reporting uncorrelated traits) had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
the relationship between root diameter and RTD (i.e., root dia-
meter × data source in the linear mixed model, p < 0.001, Sup-
plementary Table 4). Root sampling (i.e., ﬁrst order roots vs. roots
up to the third order) did not affect the relationships of root
diameter with RTD and RN (i.e., root diameter × root sampling in
the linear mixed model, p > 0.1, Supplementary Table 4). Climatic
zone did not affect RTD and RN (linear mixed model, p > 0.05,
Supplementary Table 4). Finally, for woody species, studies
reporting correlated trait relationships included a much larger
proportion of species with high RTD and thin root diameter than
studies reporting uncorrelated traits (53 vs. 17%) (Fig. 4a).
Discussion
Our global analysis of key root traits partially supports our ﬁrst
hypothesis of nonlinear relationships of RTD and RN with root
diameter in woody (but not non-woody) species (Fig. 2, Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). In woody species, the nonlinear relationships
were similar or stronger in EM and ERM species that often exist
in harsher environments than AM species;28,34 this is inconsistent
with our second hypothesis. This suggests that harsh environ-
ments may not necessarily exert a strong inﬂuence on cell wall
thickening for EM and ERM roots in woody species. It is possible
that the reduction of cortical tissue and evolutionary divergence
of EM and ERM from their AM ancestors27,35–37 (e.g., enzymes
associated with these mycorrhizas for decomposition of plant
litter or soil organic matter; the efﬁciency of carbon and nutrient
interchange between fungi and roots in the symbioses) may
enable EM and ERM species to adapt to harsher environments
and conserve nonlinear trait relationships in EM and ERM roots.
This, however, warrants further investigation.
Interestingly, for woody species we found a negative relation-
ship between RN and root diameter in EM species, while the
relationship was positive in AM and ERM species (Fig. 2d). The

negative relationship in EM species could possibly be explained
by two typical features of nutrient acquisition in EM species. First,
for EM species, thin absorptive roots are covered by a relatively
thick EM fungal mantle16, which is relatively rich in N;38 this thus
enhances the root N concentration of thin roots compared to
thick roots. This is notably different from AM species where
thicker absorptive roots are usually associated with greater
mycorrhizal colonization18,24,39. Second, EM species with thicker
absorptive roots usually have less hyphal foraging precision (i.e.,
proliferation of extraradical hyphae in resource-rich patches)40,
which can reduce nutrient uptake and hence lower RN in thicker
EM roots.
The nonlinear relationships in woody species can reconcile the
current debate on the relationship between RTD and root dia-
meter. We found weaker correlations of RTD and RN with root
diameter for studies reporting no relationship between RTD and
root diameter than for studies reporting negative relationships
between RTD and root diameter (Fig. 4). The studies reporting
negative relationships also included a higher proportion of species
with thin roots and high RTD than studies reporting no rela-
tionships. Together, this demonstrates that those studies report-
ing no relationships focus on the region of slow decrease of RTD
with increasing root diameter (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2a).

root diameter in studies reporting negative relationships may
apply only to the part of the curve with a steep decrease.
Therefore, nonlinearity of the root trait relationships could
underpin how sampling bias from different parts of the nonlinear
curves produces contradicting results as shown in recent studies.
To gain a global picture of root trait relationships, it is therefore
crucial to consider the full global range of trait variation across
different lineages of woody species.
Recognition of the nonlinear relationship between RTD and
root diameter could substantially improve our understanding of
the tradeoffs among root functional traits. Theoretically, for an
individual absorptive root (e.g., a single 1st order root), greater
investment in dry mass could result in longer root lifespan fol-
lowing the cost-beneﬁt theory41,42 as observed for aboveground
plant organs19,22. If we consider a plant root a cylinder formed by
concentrically arranged tissues, dry mass of a single 1st order root
must be a function of the total diameter as root volume increases
exponentially with diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4). For the
nonlinear relationship between RTD and root diameter (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary 2c), if the increase of the root dry mass with
increasing root diameter cannot be offset by the simultaneous
decrease of tissue density, then root dry mass will always increase
with root diameter. A modeling simulation based on the allo-
metric relationship between root conductive and cortical tissue
shows a monotonical increase of the root dry mass with
increasing root diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting a
predominant role of root diameter rather than RTD in deter-
mining the root dry mass and hence root lifespan22. This is also
supported by the consistent positive relationship between root
lifespan and root diameter12,43 and the lack of a relationship
between root lifespan and RTD in woody species (Supplementary
Fig. 5).
Furthermore, for AM species, root nutrient foraging activity
may increase with increasing root diameter because of more
resource allocation to non-cell wall fractions in the cortex (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6), offsetting the relatively small changes in
diameter of the ligniﬁed tissue in the stele (Fig. 1a)18,24, and
greater mycorrhizal colonization for thicker roots12,27. The higher
nutrient foraging activity with increasing root diameter may have
evolved to compensate for inefﬁcient proliferation of thicker AM
roots in resource rich patches40,44–46. Together, except for the
negative relationship between root diameter and RN in EM
species, the nonlinear trait relationships as revealed here suggest
that root trait relationships do not necessarily align with the RES
hypothesis. Therefore, the relative independence between changes
in cortical and stele tissues in roots24 indicates alternative
acquisition strategies in plants mediated by their interaction with
symbiotic fungi and further supports the multiple dimensionality
in root trait syndromes proposed elsewhere11.
Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between root diameter
and RTD advances our understanding of another key trait
underlying the RES, i.e., speciﬁc root length (SRL, root length per
unit root mass)11,47. Assuming that roots are cylindrically
shaped, SRL can be expressed as: SRL = 4/(π × RTD × root dia-
meter2)17,48. If RTD is positively correlated with root diameter, as
predicted by the RES, SRL then mathematically scales negatively
with RTD. However, for the region of the nonlinear curve where
RTD slowly decreases with root diameter (Fig. 2c), the negative
effect of root diameter on SRL could counteract a potential
positive effect of RTD on SRL, which, in turn, would lead to a
positive relationship of SRL with RTD. In contrast, for the region
of the nonlinear curve with fast decrease of RTD (Fig. 2c), SRL
may show no relationship with RTD. This is because with
increasing root diameter, the negative effect of root diameter on
SRL could be offset by the potential positive effect of RTD on
SRL. Together, the nonlinear relationship between RTD and root
diameter could explain an overall weak correlation of SRL with
RTD, and also with RN (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b)11,14,15,49
across the whole region of the nonlinear curve. Moreover, the
weak correlation between SRL and RN and the strong coupling of
SRL with root diameter12,14,15,50 (also see Supplementary Fig. 7c)
could also explain the relative weak correlation between root
diameter and RN (Fig. 2). Together, these results illustrate how
nonlinear root trait relationships can explain why SRL does not
necessarily conform with the RTD-related plant economics
spectrum in woody species15,49.
Our results also suggest a phylogenetic component in the
nonlinear root trait relationships, at least for woody species.
Compared with the leveling off of RTD for thick roots in the
above nonlinear relationships (Fig. 2), RTD decreases and RN
increases continuously for thick roots even when excluding the
inﬂuence of plant phylogeny (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). The
thick roots belong to early-derived angiosperms (e.g., Magnoliids,
Fig. 3) associated with phosphorus-limited tropical soils, which
suggests specialization of this root group to high dependence on
AM fungi for nutrient foraging12,25,29,51. The weaker phyloge-
netic conservatism of RTD than root diameter (Table 1)18,52
could probably be explained by specialization of early-derived
angiosperm trees to phosphorus-limited soils by maximizing the
cortex area for AM colonization, which would lead to low RTD
and high RN. Later, during the evolution of novel angiosperm
groups, natural selection promoted ﬁner roots, either to constrain
mycorrhizal colonization12,18 or to optimize water conductivity
and plant photosynthetic efﬁciency23,29. However, more research
is needed to better understanding the different evolutionary
mechanisms driving the transformation in root systems.
Different from woody species, we ﬁnd no or rather weak
nonlinear relationships between RTD, RN and root diameter in
non-woody species, although both groups follow the same allo-
metric relationships between stele and cortical tissue in absorptive
roots. The allometric relationship has been proposed to optimize
the balance between nutrient absorption via the cortex and
transportation via conduits of the steles23. Compared with
absorptive roots of woody species at a given diameter, non-woody
species are reported to have about 30% less mycorrhizal coloni-
zation12 while having a higher proportion of root cortex (t-test,
p < 0.01) and thus lower RTD. This higher proportion of cortex in
non-woody species might be associated with foraging strategies
other than mycorrhizal colonization (e.g., metabolic activity).
Therefore, in fertile soils, absorptive roots of non-woody species
may be less dense and more active than absorptive roots of woody
species53 (Supplementary Fig. 6), and have more root hairs54 and/
or root branching55. Together, this might offset the lower nutrient
acquisition through mycorrhizal associations in non-woody spe-
cies. In contrast, in infertile soils, roots of woody species may not
be much denser than non-woody species because higher RTD
would reduce mycorrhizal colonization15,16,18,27,56. However, in
infertile soils, roots of non-woody species could be denser53
relative to woody species because of lower dependence on
mycorrhizal colonization for non-woody than for woody spe-
cies12. These speculations could partially explain why roots of
non-woody species show greater variation of RTD and RN (and
hence weak nonlinear root trait relationships) compared to
woody species. Another reason for lack of nonlinear trait rela-
tionships in non-woody species may be that roots <2 mm in
diameter include some non-absorptive roots57 which typically
have larger proportion of stele than absorptive roots2, and as
such, confound root trait relationships. In contrast, absorptive
roots of woody species in previous studies (Supplementary
Data 1) are sampled based on root branching order which can
track the absorptive roots more precisely than the diameter-based
method1. We therefore recommend for future studies, when

possible, to select absorptive roots based on branching order1
rather than on root diameter.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates global nonlinear rela-
tionships of RTD and RN with root diameter among different
mycorrhizal types of woody species but not for non-woody spe-
cies. The differences between woody and non-woody species
reveal insights into the ecological and evolutionary drivers of root
structure in different plant life forms58. The nonlinear root trait
relationships, a likely outcome of evolutionary constraints, could
explain conﬂicting results among recent studies on the relation-
ships of root diameter with RTD and RN. Interestingly, EM
species show a different RN-root diameter relationship from that
found in AM and ERM species, probably because EM species
have a thinner fungal mantle and less hyphal foraging precision in
thicker absorptive roots. Furthermore, our analyses show that the
hypothesized RES11 is not supported for absorptive roots of
woody species, except for EM trees showing partial support of the
RES. We advocate that the paradigm of nonlinearity for rela-
tionships between root diameter, RTD and RN provides a more
rhizocentric way of viewing absorptive root ecological and phy-
siological strategies.
Methods
Data collection. We collected a global dataset of absorptive root traits (root dia-
meter, RTD and RN) for 505 woody (455 angiosperms, 46 gymnosperms and four
ferns) and 361 non-woody species from the Fine-Root Ecology Database (FRED)3
as well as some other literature (see Supplementary Data 1 for details). In cases
where root traits were presented only in ﬁgures, we extracted the trait values using
SigmaScan Pro software (V5.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). For woody species, root
traits were obtained from studies using either the ﬁrst order (i.e., the most terminal
root order) or up to the third orders of a root branch; in both cases, these are
considered absorptive roots1. For non-woody species, we selected studies with ﬁne
roots less than 2 mm in diameter as most of these roots are absorptive2,33. When a
trait of one species was reported in more than one study, we used the mean trait
value across these studies as most of the multiple measurements for a species came
from the same climatic zones (Supplementary Data 1). To establish relationships
between root anatomy and root diameter, RTD and RN, we collected three root
anatomical traits from the above species pools: stele radius (SR), tToS (thickness of
root tissues outside the stele), and PRS (proportion of root cross-sectional area
occupied by the stele). In total, there were 158 woody species with both the ana-
tomical traits and RTD and RN for the ﬁrstorder roots, while these data were only
available for 13 non-woody species (Supplementary Data 1).
In the dataset, we also recorded mycorrhizal status of the species which was
obtained from published studies (Supplementary Data 1) as well as from databases
of mycorrhizal classiﬁcation35,59. For woody species, plants were classiﬁed into the
following mycorrhizal types: AM (376 species), EM (89 species), ericoid
mycorrhiza (ERM, 13 species), non-mycorrhiza (NM, three species), and dual
mycorrhizas of AM and EM (AM + EM, 17 species). There were seven other
woody species with unknown mycorrhizal status. For woody species, AM + EM
were designated as EM based on their ability to diverge from its ancestral stage of
AM52. Most of the non-woody species in our dataset were AM (347/361); the
remaining species were NM (six species), unknown (three species) or dual
mycorrhizas of AM and NM (AM + NM, ﬁve species). For non-woody species,
AM + NM were considered as AM, because AM is more favored by natural
selection than NM in these dual mycorrhizal associations35.
Data analyses. Relationships between root diameter and stele radius (SR) and
tToS were tested using linear regressions, separately for woody and non-woody
species. We then tested the allometric relationship between the steles and the ToS
by exploring whether the slopes are the same for the regression of SR with root
diameter and the regression of tToS and root diameter. Differences in the allo-
metric relationships between woody and non-woody species were analyzed by
comparing slopes of the same regression between the two species groups. All slope
differences were tested using standardized major axis (SMA) in SMATR version
2.060.
We used the following steps to test the nonlinear relationships of RTD and RN
with root diameter as predicted from allometric root anatomical structures. First,
we examined whether the PRS scaled with root diameter in the predicted nonlinear
way (see Introduction for details). Then, we explored whether RTD and RN were
linearly correlated with the PRS. For the woody species, two outlier data points
were excluded, one with an exceptionally high RN (Gironniera subaequalis) and the
other with an exceptionally high PRS (Elaeocarpus hainanensis). For the non-
woody species, we did not test the relationship between the PRS and RN because
the sample size for this relationship was too small (13 species, Supplementary
Data 1). Finally, we tested whether RTD and RN each scale with root diameter in a
way similar to the relationship between the PRS and root diameter. The linear and
nonlinear regressions were performed with the lm and nls function, respectively, in
R software (v.3.30, R Core Team, 2016). This test was performed separately for
woody and non-woody species, and for different mycorrhizal types. Additionally,
for the woody species, these analyses were performed separately on the 1st order
roots and roots up to the 3rd order as differences in the root diameter of these two
categories of absorptive roots57 may change the above trait relationships.
Given the phylogenetic conservatism of many root traits18,52, we also explored
the relationships between RTD and RN, and root diameter using phylogenetic
independent contrasts (PICs)61, which account for the inﬂuence of common
ancestors on the trait relationships. PICs-based trait relationships were analyzed for
the full dataset, as well as separately for woody species and non-woody species,
respectively, using the package picante in R62. The plant phylogenetic tree was
constructed according to an updated mega-phylogeny of vascular plants63 and the
Angiosperm Phylogeny website (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/).
Species names in the phylogenetic tree were revised according to The Plant List
(http://www.theplantlist.org/). The polytomies were resolved by the multi2di
function in the ape package in R software. We estimated phylogenetic signals for
root diameter, RTD and RN by employing Blomberg’s K and Pagel’s λ tests
assuming a Brownian motion model of evolution52. We used phylogenetic
generalized least squares and ordinary least squares52,64 to test the effects of growth
form (woody vs. non-woody) and mycorrhizal types (AM, EM, and ERM) on the
relationships between root diameter and RTD and RN. We ﬁrst conducted this
analysis across all species and then separately for woody and non-woody species.
In woody species, we also tested whether the data source (i.e., studies reporting
correlated trait relationships not supporting the RES: negative RTD-root diameter
and positive RN-root diameter correlations vs. studies reporting uncorrelated traits)
inﬂuenced the relationship between root diameter and RTD using a linear mixed
model using the lmerTest package65 in R. There were a few studies on woody
species with low RTD reporting trait relationships only partially supporting the RES
(e.g., both positive RTD-root diameter and RN-root diameter relationships, see
Supplementary Data 1 for details). To test whether these few studies could inﬂuence
the nonlinear root trait relationships for studies reporting correlated trait
relationships, we tested the trait relationships both with and without these studies
using the anova method in R. The inﬂuence of these studies was not signiﬁcant
(F = 0.93, p = 0.54 for the RTD-root diameter relationships; F = 0.54, p = 0.93 for
the RN-root diameter relationships). Therefore, we added these studies to the
studies reporting correlated trait relationships not supporting the RES. Then, using a
linear mixed model, we tested the effects of the ﬁxed factors (i.e., root diameter, data
source, root sampling, climatic zone, and the study nested within the data source)
and the interactions of root diameter with the data source and with root sampling,
respectively. Climatic zones were classiﬁed as tropical, subtropical, temperate,
boreal, and Mediterranean. Study (see Supplementary Data 1) was not considered as
a random factor because they were not classiﬁed randomly but assigned to one of
the data sources according to their trait relationships. Root sampling referred to
studies collecting the ﬁrst order roots and studies collecting roots up to the third
order, respectively. Furthermore, for woody species, we explored whether the
contradicting relationships between root diameter and RTD (see Introduction and
Supplementary Data 1) as observed in previous studies were due to different species
pools. To do so, we ﬁrst compared the frequency of species with high RTD between
studies reporting correlated trait relationships and studies reporting uncorrelated
traits. The mean RTD (0.236 g cm−3) across these studies was used to separate low-
and high-RTD roots. We then ran nonlinear regressions for the relationships
between RTD and root diameter and between RN and root diameter.

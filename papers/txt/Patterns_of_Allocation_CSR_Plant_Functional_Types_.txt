Morphological and physiological parameters of 76 vascular plant species typical for Northern Europe were analyzed using Grime’s
classification. 𝐶species (competitors) have high levels of canopy height, leaf dry weight, and maximal lateral spread. 𝑅species
(ruderal) have low leaf dry weight, longer flowering period, high rate of photosynthetic capacity and respiration, and high nitrogen
content in the leaves. Stress-tolerant (𝑆) species prevailing in habitats with limited resources are small and have low rate of
photosynthetic activity and respiration. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination showed a clear separation of species of
different plant functional types according to their morphological and physiological parameters. The first PCA axis showed close
relationship with the rate of respiration and photosynthetic activity and allowed us to differentiate 𝑆from 𝑅species. The second
PCA axis correlated with morphological parameters associated with the size of plants and allowed us to differentiate 𝐶species from
𝑆and 𝑅species. Using PCA ordination, we developed a model that determines plant functional types in Northern Europe and
analyzed plant functional types of several species that are not presented in Grime’s classification. The proposed model has higher
accuracy (84%) compared to similar models designed for other climatic zones.
1. Introduction
Prediction of response of individual species, communities,
and ecosystems to the global climate changes and anthro-
pogenic impact is one of the main problems of modern
ecology [1, 2]. In such studies, it is expedient to consider
the plant functional groups of assemblages of species with
similar responses to changes in environmental conditions.
Conception of life strategies developed by Ramenskii and
Grime (the 𝐶𝑆𝑅theory) is an example of such generalization
[3, 4]. According to the 𝐶𝑆𝑅theory, there are three main types
of life strategies: competitors, ruderals, and stress-tolerators.
Species of different plant functional types have different
biomass structure, intensity, and duration of growth pro-
cesses, photosynthetic capacity and respiration rate, use of
assimilates, and features of protective, and adaptive mecha-
nisms and reactions [5–10].
Grime’s system of plant functional types includes many
species of vascular plants (more than 1000 species) that
are typical for the herbaceous flora of Great Britain [2, 11].
The flora of the higher latitudes includes many arctic and
alpine species that are not presented in Grime’s system.
Thus, the 𝐶𝑆𝑅classification cannot be used effectively to
analyze ecosystems of the northern territories. Moreover,
many species have high plasticity and demonstrate different
strategic features depending on the environmental conditions
(climatic, edaphic, and eco-coenotic), especially on the bor-
ders of their distribution areas [12].
Currently, there are several models that identify practical
ordination of wild plants within the 𝐶𝑆𝑅space. Such models
were developed for meadow vegetation of England, Ireland,
and France [13]; alpine and subalpine vegetation of Italy [14,
15]; and flora of the Great Britain [11, 16].
Hodgson et al.’s [11] and Pierce et al.’s [15] models are
the most known. These models were used to determine life
strategies in different climate zones from alpine meadows in
Italy [17] to desert vegetation in Turkey [18]. However, there
are no data of these models being used in northern latitudes.
In these models, morphological predictors are used. In
our view, morphological parameters are easier to measure

than other parameters. However, in some cases, these cannot
be used for allocating plant functional types. For example,
specific leaf area (SLA) is a key element of the “world-
wide leaf economics spectrum” [19]. SLA corresponds to
soil fertility and marks stress-tolerant species. However, in
Northern Europe where many of the habitats are shaded,
the leaf economics spectrum breaks down [20]. We attempt
to provide a methodology that gets around this problem
using functional (physiological) along with morphological
predictors. Functional traits such as photosynthetic capacity,
respiration rate, and concentration of carbon and nitrogen
in leaves reflect processes of energy transformation and are
closely related to plant activity, growth, and productivity
[7, 9]. Thus, these are closely linked to the plant functional
types.
The aim of the present study was to develop mathematical
model allocating 𝐶𝑆𝑅functional type of vascular plants in
Northern Europe based on morphological and functional
parameters.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Plant Material. In our investigations, 76 species of herbs
were used (57 have 𝐶𝑆𝑅status in Grime’s system; see
Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material available online at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1323614) from 69 genera, 30
families. Nomenclature is given according to Cherepanov
[21].
2.2. Study Sites and Data Source. Investigations were carried
out during 2013–2015 in the middle taiga subzone (near
Syktyvkar city, 61∘34󸀠N, 50∘33󸀠E), in the northern taiga (Ilych
River basin, 63∘13󸀠N, 58∘34󸀠E), and far northern taiga (near
Seida village, 67∘3󸀠N, 62∘36󸀠E). Studies of morphological
and physiological parameters were performed during the
flowering period (July) in typical communities. Most of the
data on physiological parameters (photosynthetic capacity
and respiration rate) were obtained previously [10].
In addition, we used the data from the TRY DB database
(https://www.try-db.org/) [22] in order to eliminate differ-
ences in species morphology related to specific habitats.
Among all the received data, records from the territory
of Central and Northern Europe and Great Britain (more
than 17,000 primary records) were selected. The average
parameters from all sources (arithmetic mean) were used in
the succeeding analysis.
2.3. Trait Measurement
2.3.1. Canopy Height. Canopy height was measured from the
ground to the top of the generative parts of plants [2].
Measures were conducted with a 30-time replication.
2.3.2. Leaf Dry Weight and Dry Matter Content. Leaf area
and dry weight were measured in mature leaves from the
middle of stems. Leaf area was measured using photo images
by using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Measures of leaf
wet weight were made in the field during 1-2 h after sampling.
Sampled leaves were placed in hermetically sealed plastic
bags to reduce the evaporation of water. Leaf dry weight
was measured in the laboratory after the leaves were dried
for 24 h at a temperature of 80∘C. Dry matter content was
calculated as percent ratio of leaf dry weight to leaf wet
weight. Measurements of 30–120 samples were replicated
according to size and weight of leaves.
2.3.3. Lateral Spread and Phenological Data. Lateral spread
of the species is determined by root system, life form, and
distance between the ramets (vegetative individuals) of the
plant [11]. We used Raunkiær’s life-form systems to determine
the type of lateral spread of each species. Phenology of the
model species was studied using http://www.plantarium.ru/
(open atlas of vegetation of Russia and bordering countries).
2.3.4. Functional Parameters. CO2 exchange of the leaves
was measured using LI-7000 (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE,
USA) and LCPro+ (ADC BioScientific Ltd., Hoddesdon,
UK) systems based on the IR analyzer. Small leaves (smaller
than the chamber area) were measured in groups. Large
leaves (length or width does not fit in the chamber) were
cut from the middle without large veins. Gas exchange of
excised leaves was measured. Photosynthetic capacity was
measured at saturating photosynthetically active radiation
(800–1200 𝜇mol/m2c); respiration rate of the leaves was
measured in the dark at a temperature of 18–20∘C. Leaves
were sampled from 10 to 15 individual plants. The results for
photosynthesis and respiration are presented based on the
leaf dry weight.
The content of total nitrogen and carbon was measured
in dry ground biomass using elemental CHNS analyzer EA-
1110 (Italy) in the ecoanalytical laboratory of the Institute
of Biology of Komi SC UB, RAS. Samples were collected in
double replication, and each sample was analyzed in double
or triple replication.
2.4. CSR Classification. The basis of the 𝐶𝑆𝑅classification is
three axes that are related to competition, stress tolerance, and
ruderality of species (Figure 1(a)). Grime allocated 19 types of
primary, secondary, and tertiary plant functional types [2].
It is common to use letter designations for plant functional
types (Figure 1(b)). However, in modeling, it is easier to use
digital coordinates of species in the three axes (Figure 1(c)).
2.5. Model Building Scheme. In the first step, the 𝐶𝑆𝑅status
of species (which are presented in the classification) was
determined according to Grime’s classification [11].
Then species were divided into four groups: species with
domination of competitor strategy (𝐶, 𝐶/𝐶𝑅, 𝐶/𝐶𝑆, and
𝐶/𝐶𝑆𝑅), ruderal strategy (𝑅, 𝑅/𝐶𝑅, 𝑅/𝑆𝑅, and 𝑅/𝐶𝑆𝑅), and
stress-tolerators (𝑆, 𝑆/𝑆𝐶, 𝑆/𝑆𝑅, and 𝑆/𝐶𝑆𝑅). In addition,
we defined a group of species as intermediate types (𝐶𝑆𝑅,
𝐶𝑅/𝐶𝑆𝑅, 𝑆𝐶/𝐶𝑆𝑅, 𝑆𝑅/𝐶𝑆𝑅, 𝐶𝑅, 𝑆𝐶, and 𝑆𝑅) (Figure 1(b)).
Furthermore, we used the analysis of variance to select
traits with significant difference (𝑝< 0.05) between these
four groups. These parameters were included in the model.

Figure 1: The basic classification of 𝐶𝑆𝑅plant functional types [11]. (a) Main axes: 𝐶axis of competition (ability of plants to displace the
other species under favorable environmental conditions); 𝑆axis of stress tolerance (ability to withstand long-term adverse environmental
conditions); and 𝑅axis of ruderality (ability to grow faster in disturbed sites). (b) Primary, secondary, and tertiary functional types (a total of
19 types). (c) Triple coordinates of the types.
The model was based on multivariate analysis by principal
component analysis (PCA) according to their morphological
and physiological traits selected in the previous step. The
obtained two-dimensional PCA coordinates for all species
were then allocated to three axes of 𝐶𝑆𝑅space. The axes of
𝐶𝑆𝑅space were presented using lines connecting the center of
PCA ordination with centroids (mean values of coordinates
of species allocated to one group) for 𝐶, 𝑆, and 𝑅groups,
respectively.
The projection of PCA coordinates of all species to these
three axes was considered as new (adjusted) coordinates in
𝐶𝑆𝑅space.
In the last step, we identified the 𝐶𝑆𝑅strategy for each
species as a one of 19 plant functional types that have a
minimum distance to the 𝐶𝑆𝑅coordinates of species. The
distance is calculated by the formula 𝑆𝑆= (𝐶𝑢−𝐶𝑚)2 + (𝑆𝑢−
𝑆𝑚)2 + (𝑅𝑢−𝑅𝑚)2, where 𝐶𝑢, 𝑆𝑢, and 𝑅𝑢are the coordinates
of species and 𝐶𝑚, 𝑆𝑚, and 𝑅𝑚are the possible strategies [11].
All analyses were performed for transformed data
(Table 1).
The relationship between parameters was assessed using
Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation. Variance analy-
sis, PCA ordination, and correlation analysis were performed
using IBM SPSS Statistics 19. Model allocation for plant
functional types was realized in Microsoft Excel.

epigejos, and Dactylis glomerata) and nitrophilous plants of
rich habitats (Artemisia vulgaris, Urtica dioica, Arctium lappa,
and Angelica sylvestris). These species were characterized by
a height more than 1 m.
SLA did not demonstrate significant differences among
plant functional types (Table 2). The maximal SLA values
at 50–60 mm2/mg were revealed for 𝑆species preferring
spruce forests (Oxalis acetosella and Trientalis europaea) and
ruderal species Stellaria media and Myosotis arvensis (40–
50 mm2/mg). Minimal SLA values were found for species
from the competitor group (15–30 mm2/mg). 𝑆species pre-
ferring mire and mountain tundra communities (Rubus
chamaemorus, Saussurea alpina, and Hedysarum arcticum)
demonstrated low SLA levels.
LDMC increased in the 𝑅-𝑆-𝐶species order. The highest
LDMC (32–38%) was found for grasses from the competitor
group (Bromopsis inermis, Calamagrostis epigejos, and Elyt-
rigia repens). Ruderal species demonstrated minimal LDMC
values at 9–13% (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stellaria media, and
Taraxacum officinale). Stress-tolerators included species with
both low (Oxalis acetosella and Trientalis europaea) and high
(Melica nutans and Pyrola rotundifolia) levels of LDMC.
The functional traits (PN, RD, and LNC) also show a
significant difference between functional types. PN and RD
of leaves increased in the 𝑆-𝐶-𝑅species order (Table 2). The
highest level of LNC was revealed in the leaves of species from
𝑅and 𝐶plant functional types (3% in dry weight), and this
was higher than in leaves of 𝑆species (Table 2).
The group of 𝐶𝑆𝑅species according to most of the traits
(except for FP, FS, and LCC) is in the intermediate position
in the 𝐶𝑆𝑅system (Table 2). This fact allows us to use 𝐶𝑆𝑅
group as the “starting point.” Differences in morphological
and functional parameters from this “starting point” were
interpreted as a “shift” of the species location in Grime’s
triangle relative to the central 𝐶𝑆𝑅point.

axis 2 accounted for 44.2% of total variation. PCA 1 was
closely correlated with RD and PN that reflected the rate of
metabolism (Table 3, Figure 3) and showed distinct grouping
of 𝑆and 𝑅species. Typical 𝑆species are located in the left
part of the PCA 1 and demonstrated low levels of PN and RD.
Opposite positions of the PCA 1 axis are occupied by 𝑅species
(Capsellabursa-pastoris, Lepidotheca suaveolens, and Stellaria
media) with maximal values of PN and RD. 𝐶species are in
intermediate position.
PCA 2 axis was positively correlated with the following
morphological traits: CH, LDW, LS, and LDMC (Table 3,
Figure 2). 𝐶species of large physical size are located in
the upper part of the PCA ordination: Angelica sylvestris,
Elytrigia repens, Filipendula ulmaria, Urtica dioica, and Vicia
sylvatica. Small-size 𝑅species (Myosotis arvensis, Poa annua)
and 𝑆species are moved to the bottom part of the ordination
diagram (Campanula rotundifolia, Oxalis acetosella).
The next step was to convert the two-dimensional PCA
ordination to the relevant 𝐶, 𝑆, and 𝑅axes in Grime’s triangle.
For this purpose, we projected points to the lines connecting
the center of PCA ordination with centroids of 𝐶, 𝑆, and
𝑅groups. The projections of species on these lines were
considered as new coordinates in 𝐶𝑆𝑅space. For example,
the species Dactylis glomerata, with PCA coordinates (0.734
and 1.257), after such projection will receive new coordinates
(1.277, −1.360, and −0.022)in the 𝐶, 𝑆, and 𝑅axes, respectively
(Figure 3). These values have a minimum distance to the point
(1, −1, and −1), which corresponds to 𝐶/𝐶𝑆𝑅plant functional
type.
The developed model is provided in Excel spreadsheet in
Supplementary Material Appendix 1.
The coordinates of species in 𝐶𝑆𝑅space of our model
were closely correlated with their coordinates in Grime’s
classification. The 𝐶axis showed a correlation of 0.78 and 𝑆
and 𝑅axes 0.64 (𝑝< 0.01) (Table 3).

their relative growth rate are considered as key traits in
the classification of plant functional types [2]. Competitor
species more often establish intact habitats with favorable
environmental conditions [2, 11]. These plants capture most of
the resources and invest them into its own biomass. Leaves of
competitor plants are high and/or have large area and weight
(Table 2). Markers of 𝐶type could be such traits (Table 3)
as CH (correlation coefficient with the 𝐶axis in our model –
0.71), LDW (correlation coefficient – 0.56), and high LS values
of 0.61
In Grime’s model, competitors are considered as fast-
growing species with low LDMC values. On the contrary,
according to our data, 𝐶species demonstrate the highest
LDMC values. This observation is likely connected with the
fact that most of the Northern 𝐶species cease active growth in
July (the month when we take samples) and begin flowering.
As growth ceases, cell wall thickening occurs, leading to an
increase in the LDMC values.
Stress-tolerators, prevailing in conditions with lim-
ited resources, are slow-growing plants with low rate of
metabolism [2, 5, 10, 11, 23]. Stress-tolerators are small
plants with the lowest values of photosynthetic activity and
respiration rate that reveal minimal content of nitrogen and
maximal content of carbon in the leaves. The highest negative
correlations with 𝑆axis were found for CH, PN, RD, and LNC
(Table 3).
It is considered that low SLA values indicate stress-
tolerant species with relatively low growth rate [24, 25]. SLA
indicates acquisitive economics of the leaf area development.
Low SLA values are typical for plants of 𝑆type with low
metabolism and growth rate [19, 26, 27]. However, the use
of this parameter leads to several issues, called the “Oxalis”
effect [16]. The key aspect of this effect is that a group
of 𝑆species includes plants growing under different kinds
of stress; therefore, they have different adaptive reactions
[28]. In our study, species of tundra and mire communities
(Epilobium palustre, Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex dioica,
and Potentilla crantzii) growing in an environment with
waterlogging and limited nutritional elements were often
characterized by thick leathery leaves and demonstrated low

SLA values (10–30 mm2/mg). However, species preferring
spruce forests with limited light (Fragaria vesca, Oxalis
acetosella, and Trientalis europaea) had high SLA values (up
to 50–60 mm2/mg). Therefore, following Gross et al. [29], we
considered that SLA should ideally not be used as a marker
of 𝑆plant functional type.
Ruderals prefer rich habitats with weak competition
caused by certain disturbance of the vegetation cover. These
species demonstrate high growth rate provided by increased
metabolic activity: intensive respiration and high nitrogen
content in leaves [8, 10, 23, 26, 30]. Usually, ruderals are
annual and biennial species with seed reproduction, investing
most of their resources to reproduction. They occupy dis-
turbed habitats owing to their accelerated ontogenetic devel-
opment (ephemeroids) and/or extended period of flowering
and fruiting [4]. According to our data, low values of lateral
spread (LS) and long flowering period (FP) could be markers
of 𝑅plant functional type. Ruderals also demonstrated low
LDMC values, high SLA values, and maximal level of PN and
RD (Tables 2 and 3).
4.2. Validation of the Developed Model Allocating Plant Func-
tional Types in Northern Europe. Table 4 shows a comparison
of Grime’s functional types [2] with plant functional types
allocated using Hodgson et al.’s model [11], Pierce et al.’s model
[15], and our model. The number of steps (points of tertiary
𝐶𝑆𝑅classification, Figure 1(b)) was determined between the
species location in our model and that in Grime’s system. If
functional types matched, there were no steps. Maximal four
steps were noted when the coordinates of functional types
were in the opposite sides of Grime’s triangle.
In Hodgson et al.’s model, only 40% of species (23
from 57) showed high matching (distance 0 or 1) (Table 4,
Figure 4(a)). Of the species, 35% demonstrated low matching
(distance 2) and 21% strong deviation (distance 3). Two
species (Melica nutans and Oxalis acetosella) demonstrated
extremely distant locations (distance 4).
In general, in Hodgson et al.’s model, the highest deviation
(distances 3 and 4) was found for 𝑆species typical for spruce
forests (Oxalis acetosella, Trientalis europaea, Fragaria vesca,
and Geum rivale). All these species demonstrated high SLA
and low LDMC values and, according to the modeling, were
allocated as 𝐶𝑅, 𝑅/𝐶𝑅, or 𝐶/𝐶𝑅type (Table 4). Obtained dif-
ference may be explained by the “Oxalis” effect. Only species
with low SLA values (20–30 mm2/mg and lower) and high
LDMC values (over 30%) may be potentially considered as
stress-tolerators based on the analysis of regression equations
of Hodgson et al.’s model. In the northern environment, there
are species typical for tundra and mire communities, for
example, Rubus chamaemorus. It should also be noted that
functional types of almost all species allocated using Hodgson
et al.’s model were moved to increasing 𝐶and 𝑅points and
decreasing 𝑆points (Table 4).
Comparing the model of Pierce et al. [15] with the
reference position showed high matching (distances 0 and 1)
for 46% of the species (Table 4, Figure 4(b)). Low similarity
(distance 2) was revealed for 40% of the species. High
deviation (distances 3 and 4) was noted for 14% of the species,
including stress-tolerators (Oxalis acetosella and Trientalis
europaea) and grass competitors (Bromopsis inermis and
Elytrigia repens).
The analysis of the model developed in our research
showed the highest matching with the reference species
positions given in Grime’s classification. Distance between
relevant and reference position of species was 0 or 1 for 84%
of species. Nine species (16%) demonstrated low matching

∗Distance: number of tertiary types between reference strategy and determined by models.
(distance 2). Distances 3 and 4 were not revealed at all
(Table 4, Figure 4(c)).
Some species demonstrated high deviation between the
reference strategy and our model (distance 2 in Table 4).
Epilobium palustre has 𝑆/𝐶𝑆𝑅type in Grime’s classification.
However, in our case study, it was allocated in 𝑅/𝐶𝑆𝑅type.
Shifting the species position to the ruderal type was caused
by relatively high values of PN (17 mg CO2/g dry weight per
hour) and RD (3.1 mg CO2/g dry weight per hour), which is
typical for 𝐶and 𝑅species (Table 2). Change of functional
type of Hypericum maculatum from 𝐶𝑅/𝐶𝑆𝑅to 𝑆𝐶/𝐶𝑆𝑅was
caused by low values of PN (6.5 mg CO2/g dry weight per
hour) and RD (1 mg CO2/g dry weight per hour), which is
typical for plants of 𝑆functional type.
Some species demonstrating changes in their functional
types (Poa annua, Polygonum aviculare, Pimpinella saxifraga,
and Vicia sepium) have known not only the position in
Grime’s classification but also the “area of variability” [2].
For example, P. annua has 𝑅type in Grime’s 𝐶𝑆𝑅system.
However, its potential “area of variability” (noted by a dotted
line in Figure 5(a)) covers the area of 𝐶𝑅-𝐶𝑆𝑅-𝑆𝑅types. In
our model, P. annua was allocated in 𝑆𝑅functional type,
which is in the area of possible types. Similar results were
found for Polygonum aviculare, P. saxifraga, and V. sepium
(Figure 5).
Therefore, our model allows to us consider a wide variety
of species establishing different habitats with different ecolog-
ical backgrounds. Averaging of morphological and functional
traits for large variety of plants from Russia and Central
and Northern Europe allowed us to clarify the impact of
specific environment and to analyze the traits determined
by genotypic specificity. It should be noted that, by using
functional traits closely related to the rate of metabolism, we
improved the determination accuracy for stress-tolerators.
Comparison of the developed model against other models
showed its higher accuracy for the species of Northern
Europe. It was revealed that the differences between our
model and the reference position were within the limits of
potentially possible plant functional types in Grime’s triangle.
Obtained data on morphological and functional parameters
can be used as markers for allocating plant functional types
of northern species not presented in Grime’s classification.

Abstract.
We explain how to obtain a generalized maximum-likelihood chi-square statis-
tic,X 2
ML, and a full-model Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) statistic for piecewise structural
equation modeling (SEM); that is, structural equations without latent variables whose causal
topology can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The full piecewise SEM is
decomposed into submodels as a Markov network, each of which can have different distribu-
tional assumptions or functional links and that can be modeled by any method that produces
maximum-likelihood parameter estimates. The generalized X 2
ML is a function of the difference
in the maximum likelihoods of the model and its saturated equivalent and the full-model AIC
is calculated by summing the AIC statistics of each of the submodels.
Key words:
Akaike Information Criterion; directed acyclic graph; d-separation; maximum likelihood;
model selection; path analysis; piecewise SEM.
INTRODUCTION
Structural equations modeling (SEM) is a multivariate
statistical method that allows one to test hypotheses con-
cerning the causal structure believed to generate the
observed data. Modern SEM was developed in disci-
plines in which the variables of theoretical interest are
primarily latent (i.e., not directly measured). By making
certain assumptions concerning the data (multivariate
normality, mutually independent observations, linear
relationships between the variables), and by maximizing
the likelihood of the data given these assumptions, one
obtains an inferential test of the fit between the data and
the hypothesized SEM via the maximum-likelihood chi-
square statistic (Bollen 1989) and an Akaike Informa-
tion statistic (AIC). Much effort has gone into relaxing
the assumption of multivariate normality but available
statistical SEM programs still largely require linearity of
relationships, although nonlinearity due to binary or
ordered categorical variables can be modeled via a link
function. Furthermore, although some forms of nesting
can be accommodated (e.g., Shipley 2016:Chapter 7), it
is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to accommodate
more complicated forms of nonindependence of obser-
vations because of nesting, temporal, spatial or phyloge-
netic correlations, or cross-classification.
Some theoretical variables in ecology cannot be
directly measured, or else contain substantial measure-
ment error; in such cases, one should model such vari-
ables as latent. Examples of latent variables are soil
“fertility” (Daou and Shipley 2019) or components of
metal bioavailability in toxicology (Beaumelle et al.
2016). However, variables of theoretical interest in ecol-
ogy can often be directly measured without substantial
error. In such cases, the causal hypothesis can be repre-
sented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) without
latents, that is, a path model. Unfortunately, variables in
ecological models are often linked to other variables
through nonlinear functions that cannot be linearized
through transformation and that follow nonnormal dis-
tributions. Furthermore, nonindependence of observa-
tions because of nesting, temporal, phylogenetic or
spatial correlations, or cross-classification, are common.
Shipley (Shipley 2000, Kang and Shipley 2009, Shipley
2009) developed a general inferential test (a “dsep test”)
for DAGs without latent variables that is based on
Pearl’s (Verma and Pearl 1988, Pearl 2009) d-separation
claims of a DAG; a dsep test can easily include different
distributional
assumptions,

observations, and nonlinear functional links. This allows
one to test the causal implications of such path models
(i.e., the topology of the DAG) more generally than with
classical maximum-likelihood SEM. In classical maxi-
mum-likelihood SEM, parameter estimation and model
testing are done simultaneously. Model testing via the
dsep test does not estimate the free parameters of the
path model; instead, parameter estimation is only done
after the topology of the causal model (the DAG) has
been judged consistent with the data by decomposing
the full path model into a set of submodels (thus, “piece-
wise”) consisting of each endogenous variable and its
causal parents. The parameter estimates can be based on
different probability distributions and the direct links
between variables can have different functional forms. A
version of the dsep test whose conditional independence
claims can be tested via linear, generalized linear, or lin-
ear mixed models has been implemented in the piece-
wiseSEM R package (Lefcheck 2016).
Although the dsep test, in combination with a signifi-
cance level, allows one to decide if the causal structure
of a path model should be rejected given the observed
data, it does not detect errors other than in the causal
topology. It is possible for models having different causal
topologies to be consistent with the data based on the
dsep test. When this occurs, we require a method of
comparing these different models. Such a method, based
on Akaike’s (1973) Information Criterion (AIC), was
developed by Shipley (2013); we will call this a “dsep
AIC” to distinguish it from the new AIC statistic devel-
oped in this paper. The dsep AIC statistic is based solely
on the causal topology of a DAG, as captured by its d-
separation claims and the resulting C-statistic, and is
appropriate when comparing path models that differ in
their causal topology. When path models differ in
aspects besides their causal topology, Shipley’s (2013)
dsep AIC statistic does not reflect such differences. Here,
we generalize the maximum-likelihood chi-square statis-
tic to allow for the complications described above and
then develop a new AIC statistic for piecewise SEM.
These two statistics take into account the topology of
the DAG, the parameter estimates of the path model,
and the distributional assumptions of the submodels of
the path model. We will call this new AIC statistic a
“full-model AIC.”
DAGS AND LOCAL MARKOV DECOMPOSITION
A DAG (Pearl 2009) represents a multivariate causal
hypothesis without feedback or free covariances and
links variables with their direct causes by a directed rela-
tionship (an arrow). An arrow from a cause (X) to its
direct effect (Y, i.e., X ? Y) means that a change in X
will induce a change in Y even when all other variables
in the model are held constant. A piecewise SEM con-
sists of (1) a set of variables, (2) a DAG representing the
topology of the multivariate causal hypothesis specifying
the links between these variables, and (3) a statistical
model specifying the function (including its parameters)
linking each effect to its direct causes. This is also called
a Bayesian network (or belief network) in the field of
artificial intelligence (Pearl 1988). For instance, the
DAG in Fig. 1a is translated into a piecewise model M
involving five submodels (Eq. 1) as follows:
x1 ¼ p1 x1jh1
ð
Þ
x2 ¼ f2ðx1; H2Þ þ p2ðx2jh2Þ
x3 ¼ f3ðx2; H3Þ þ p3ðx3jh3Þ
x4 ¼ f4ðx2; H4Þ þ p4ðx4jh4Þ
x5 ¼ f5ðx3; x4; H5Þ þ p5ðx5jh5Þ
(1)
here, pi xijhi
ð
Þ is a probability distribution function for
variable xi given a vector of parameters hi (for instance,
theoretical means or variances) and fiðpai; HiÞ is a func-
tion describing the expected value of xi given its direct
causes (“parents” pai) having a vector of parameters Hi
(for example, slopes or intercepts); pai is an empty set if
xi has no explicit causes (an exogenous variable) like x1
in Fig. 1. For notational simplicity, we will simply write
hi to include both the parameters of the functional link
(Hi) if the variable is endogenous and of its probability
density function (hi). The full set of parameters are
either “fixed” (their values are specified by hypothesis)
or “free” (their values are chosen based on the data by
maximizing the likelihood of the model). A model M
given a DAG with v variables will have v such submodels.
A key property of such models is that the joint probabil-
ity distribution over the variables can be decomposed
through local Markov decomposition into the product
of v local univariate probability distributions (Pearl
2000):

of SEM (Bollen 1989) compares the
observed and model-fitted covariance matrices and tests
the null hypothesis that these two matrices are equal
except for random sampling variation. This statistic
assumes a multivariate normal distribution. However,
this statistic is a special case of a more general formula-
tion (Bollen 1989, Haughton et al. 1997) which is the
well-known likelihood ratio statistic between two nested
models (Eq. 4). One model (M1) is nested within
another (M2) if the free parameters of the nested (more
constrained) model M1 are a subset of the free parame-
ters of the less constrained model M2 into which it is
nested. When testing the hypothesized causal topology
of a model, the “missing” arrows in M1 are translated
into path coefficients fixed to zero, and the less con-
strained (“saturated”) model M2 will have these path
coefficients as free parameters. Appendix S1 explains in
more detail how to construct saturated models. If the
additional free parameters of M2 really are equal to zero
in the statistical population (i.e., their fixed values in
M1) then X 2
ML will asymptotically follow a chi-squared
distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the differ-
ence (f2  f1) in the number of free parameters between
the less constrained M2 and the more constrained nested
model M1 (Wilks 1938). Note that the minimal sample
size required for obtaining a good approximation to a
chi-squared distribution depends on the actual distribu-
tional forms used in the models and does not apply if
some of the free parameters are estimated at their theo-
retical boundaries. If M2 is a fully saturated model (i.e.,
there are no “missing” arrows), the endogenous vari-
ables of which follow a multivariate normal distribution,
then Eq. 4 reduces to the maximum-likelihood chi-
square statistic of SEM (Haughton et al. 1997). Given
Eq. 3, we can obtain the maximum likelihoods of both
models M1 and M2 in Eq. 4 without assuming linearity
or normality, as long as we can obtain the univariate
maximum likelihoods of each of the submodels. Stan-
dard solutions already exist to calculate univariate maxi-
mum likelihoods of linear or nonlinear regressions,
generalized linear models, mixed models, or generalized
additive models:

OBTAINING A GENERALIZED AIC STATISTIC
Akaike’s Information Criterion is given in Equation 5
by Akaike (1973), where LM is the likelihood function
of the model, ^h is a vector of free parameters (slopes,
intercepts, variances, etc.) estimated at their maximum
likelihoods given the data (X), and K is the number of
free parameters in ^h. The AIC statistic, as applied to
classic maximum likelihood SEM, is given in Bollen
(1989) and Haughton et al. (1997) and is routinely given
in common SEM programs including the popular lavaan
package in R (Rosseel 2012). This classic maximum-like-
lihood AIC statistic takes into account both the causal
topology of the model and the parameter estimates, but
assumes multivariate normality, linearity of relation-
ships, and complete independence of observations. The
classic maximum-likelihood AIC statistic cannot be used
when these assumptions are violated, which renders it
useless for the path models when nonnormal distribu-
tions, nonlinear relationships, or partial nonindepen-
dence because of nesting or other complications exist.

However, given Eq. 3, the AIC statistic for a piecewise
model M is simply the sum of the AIC statistics obtained
from each of the i submodels (Eq. 6). Note that the AIC
takes the sum of the likelihood of each of submodel and
not the difference in likelihood between the hypothesized
and saturated model. The second-order bias correction
for small samples (AIC
M, Eq. 7) can be used as well

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
All analyses and simulations were done in the R statis-
tical language (R_Development Core_Team 2016). The
associated R code is given in DataS1: R code. We gener-
ate 100 mutually independent observations following the
DAG in Fig. 1a, using different distributional assump-
tions. For comparison with classical SEM, we first gener-
ate these observations using linear relationships and
normal distributions (Table 1). We fit the classical maxi-
mum-likelihood SEM with intercepts using the sem()
function of the lavaan library of R (Rosseel 2012) to be
comparable with the piecewise SEM. The four submodels
were fit using the glm() function of R, specifying a nor-
mal error distribution. The maximum-likelihood and
AIC statistics were obtained via the logLik() and AIC()
functions. Table 1 gives the results. All of the resulting
values are identical to the values as output using the sem
() function of lavaan. If we instead fit the incorrect model
that follows the DAG in Fig. 1b, the results are again
identical to values as output using the sem() function.
Now, consider a more complicated model, whose
topology is given in Fig. 1a, but having a mixture of chi-
squared, Poisson, normal, and binomial distributed vari-
ables (Table 2). Furthermore, the relationship between
x2 and x1 is nonlinear and cannot be linearized by trans-
formation. It is impossible to fit such a model in classical
SEM, but it is quite easy to do this using piecewise
SEM. We model this nonlinear relationship with a gener-
alized additive model via the gam() function with the
error structure modeled as a normal distribution, but
one could replace this with a nonlinear regression if
desired. The remaining submodels are fit via the glm()
function in R with appropriate distributional families
and link functions. Table 2 summarizes the results. In
particular, the resulting X 2
ML is 3.35 (5 df) giving a null
probability of 0.65. Using the dsep test, we get a C-statis-
tic of 7.68 (10 df), giving a null probability of 0.66. Note
that this dsep test cannot be done via the piecewise SEM
library of R because its current version does not accept
generalized additive model objects.
We can now compare alternative path models via the
full-model AIC statistic. Our comparison involves four
competing models that differ in either the causal topol-
ogy (Fig. 1a,b) and in whether the link between x2 and
x1 is linear or nonlinear. The values of this full-model
AIC statistic, and its behavior relative to Shipley’s
(2013) dsep AIC statistic, are given in Table 3. The rank-
ing of the four models using the full-model AIC (DAIC
relative to the best model) is: correct topology and non-
linear link > correct topology and linear link (+10.33) >
incorrect topology and nonlinear link (+19.39) > incor-
rect topology and linear link (+29.73). The increase in
the full-model AIC statistic identifies the three poorer
models as clearly inferior given common criteria (Ander-
son 2008). Using the dsep AIC the ranking is correct
topology and linear link > correct topology and nonlin-
ear link (+3.126) > incorrect topology and linear link
(+17.24)
>
incorrect
topology
and
nonlinear
link
(+20.37). The increase in the dsep AIC statistic again
identifies the two models with the incorrect topology as
clearly inferior, but the model with both the correct
topology and nonlinear link is incorrectly identified as
inferior.
To explore the degree to which the X 2
ML statistic
approximates its theoretical asymptotic chi-squared dis-
tribution, we simulated 5,000 independent data sets for
sample sizes of 50, 100, 200, and 500 independent obser-
vations, and following the multivariate normal and non-
linear, nonnormal models given in Table 2. Appendix S2:
Table S1 summarizes the results. The model with linear
relationships and multivariate normal distributions pro-
duced correct 5% null probabilities when sample sizes
were at least 100 and the full tail distribution agreed with
the asymptotic chi-square distribution at a sample size
of 500. The model with nonnormal distributions and a
nonlinear path had conservative null probability esti-
mates even at a sample size of 500, although the degree
of bias was small with an asymptotic probability esti-
mate of 0.05 corresponding to an empirical probability
of between 0.05 and 0.08 depending on the sample size.

submodels of which are fit using maximum likelihood
estimation including linear, nonlinear, generalized linear,
mixed, and generalized additive models. They are based
on the local Markov decomposition, which implies that
they cannot be applied to models involving latent vari-
ables or having free covariances (correlated errors). The
values of these generalized versions are identical to those
obtained in classical SEM when using the assumptions
of classical SEM. Although Eqs. 3 and 5 have already
been used in the artificial intelligence literature on Baye-
sian networks, assigning proper credit for these equa-
tions is difficult. Koller and Friedman (2009) developed
Eq. 3 from Eq. 2 but did not link it to an AIC statistic.
Liu et al. (2012) used the AIC statistic given in Eq. 5 but
did not develop it. Both Silander and Myllym€aki (2006)
and Sullivant (2010) have independently proposed this
method to find optimal topologies in Bayesian networks.
To our knowledge, this paper is the first time that Eqs.
2–4 have been combined to produce this generalized
X 2
ML test.
The dsep test and the generalized X 2
ML test are related
but not identical. The dsep test concerns only the causal
topology, as fixed by the d-separation claims. Depend-
ing on how the saturated model is constructed, the gen-
eralized X 2
ML
test can either test only the causal
topology or also the distributional assumptions and
functional links. For example, when fitting the correct
model to the data (Table 3) the dsep test and the X 2
ML
test give essentially the same null probability (P = 0.66
vs. 0.65). However, the X 2
ML test rejects the model
(X 2
ML=16.81, 6.6 df, P = 0.01) with a linear path
between x2 and x1, even though the causal topology is
correct, when comparing it to the correct saturated
model that includes this nonlinear path. This occurs
because the only difference between the fitted model
and its saturated version is the form (linear or nonlin-
ear) of this path. When the model with an incorrect lin-
ear path is compared to a saturated version that also
contains this linear path, the X 2
ML test does not reject
the model, because, in this comparison, the only

Notes: C (df, null p) is the dsep C-statistic, its degrees of freedom, and its null probability. X 2
ML (df, null p) is the maximum-likeli-
hood test statistic, its degrees of freedom, and its null probability. Also listed are the AIC statistics (DAIC relative to the best model)
of the dsep method and of this paper, maximum log-likelihoods, the number of free parameters in the model.

difference is in the causal topology, which is correct
(X 2
ML=3.35, 5 df, P = 0.65). The X 2
ML therefore has
some advantages over the C-statistic whenever the
structural equations of the DAG can be expressed in a
maximum-likelihood context: (1) model testing and
parameter
estimation
are
done
simultaneously;
in
the case of mixed-effect models the calculation of P-
values in the dsep test can be problematic; (2) it allows
one to calculate modification indices similar to what is
done in classical sem (Shipley 2016). However, the dsep
test is still the only test available when the conditions
required for maximum likelihood are not met; for
example, when using distance matrices (Frenette-Dus-
sault et al. 2013). Additionally, the dsep test is preferred
with small sample sizes and exact tests of conditional
independence. Furthermore, the individual d-separation
claims in the basis set of the dsep test provide guidance
for model modification when the overall model is
rejected. The different conclusions of the full-model
and dsep AIC statistics also require proper interpreta-
tion. One interpretation of the AIC statistic is that it
compares model fit (quantified by the maximum log-
likelihood) to model simplicity (quantified by the num-
ber of free parameters required to produce this fit)
(Burnham and Anderson 2002, Anderson 2008). The
dsep AIC concerns only differences in the causal topol-
ogy of the model; it is meant only for comparing alter-
native models that differ in their causal topologies (i.e.,
their d-separation claims). It is for this reason that the
dsep AIC clearly identifies the two models having the
incorrect causal topology as inferior but, within each
group having the same causal topology, incorrectly pre-
fers the model with fewer free parameters, that is, the
linear link between x2 and x1. However, the full-model
AIC statistic incorporates both the causal topology (the
d-separation claims) and any other assumptions con-
cerning the fitted parameter values of the full model.
These assumptions include different probability distri-
butions of the endogenous variables, different func-
tional forms of the links between a parent and its
causal children, equality constraints on subsets of
parameters, and any complications arising from nesting,
cross-classification, or correlations arising from spatial,
temporal, or phylogenetic correlations if these can be
modeled in a way that provides a likelihood function.
Because these other aspects of the model are included
with our new full-model AIC statistic, the model in
Table 3 having the correct causal topology but an incor-
rect (i.e., linear) function linking x2 to x1 was identified
as being clearly inferior. When one wishes to compare
all aspects of a piecewise SEM model based on maxi-
mum-likelihood submodels and not just the causal
topology, we therefore recommend that the generalized
X 2
ML and this new full-model AIC statistic be used
instead of the dsep test AIC statistic. However, when
doing so, it is important to remember that these two
generalized statistics reflect all errors in model fit, not
just errors in the causal topology. Depending on the
purpose of the test, this could be an advantage or a dis-
advantage.

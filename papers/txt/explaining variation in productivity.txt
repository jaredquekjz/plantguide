Abstract
While recent studies have shown the importance of intraspecific trait variation in the processes of community 
assembly, we still know little about the contributions of intraspecific trait variability to ecosystem functions. Here, 
we conducted a functional group removal experiment in an alpine meadow in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over 
4 years to investigate the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific variability in plant height for productivity. 
We split total variability in plant height within each of 75 manipulated communities into interspecific variability 
(TVinter) and intraspecific variability within a community (ITVwithin). Community-weighted mean height among 
communities was decomposed into fixed community-weighted mean (CWMfixed) and intraspecific variability 
among communities (ITVamong). We constructed a series of generalized additive mixed models and piecewise 
structural equation modeling to determine how trait variability (i.e. TVinter, ITVwithin, CWMfixed and ITVamong) 
indirectly mediated the changes in productivity in response to functional group removal. Community productivity 
was not only affected directly by treatment manipulations, but also increased with both inter- and intraspecific 
variability (i.e. CWMfixed and ITVamong) in plant height indirectly. This suggests that both the ‘selection effect’ 
and a ‘shade-avoidance syndrome’ can incur higher CWMfixed and ITVamong, and may simultaneously operate to 
regulate productivity. Our findings provide new evidence that, besides interspecific variability, intraspecific trait 
variability in plant height also plays a role in maintaining net primary productivity.

INTRODUCTION
Variation in net primary production (NPP) at the 
global scale is primarily controlled by climatic 
variables like temperature, precipitation and growing 
season length (Del Grosso et al. 2008; Nemani et al. 
2003). At small spatial scales, in which variation in 
both climatic and soil properties is severely reduced, 
variation in NPP is mainly determined by variation 
in the functional trait composition of the plant 
community and yet the capacity to predict ecosystem 
properties from plant traits has not been fully 
realized (Lavorel and Garnier 2002). At the level of 
local plant communities that differ in NPP, variation 
in functional traits arises from both intraspecific 
and interspecific variation (de Bello et al. 2011; Lepš 
et al. 2011; Violle et al. 2012). Although functional 
plant ecologists have made progress in determining 
the relative extent of intraspecific and interspecific 
variation for several traits (e.g. Carlucci et al. 2015; 
Siefert et al. 2015), we do not yet know the relative 
importance of intraspecific and interspecific trait 
variations in determining ecosystem properties 
like NPP.
An increasing body of evidence has accumulated 
in recent decades suggesting that plant functional 
traits (particularly of dominant species) can predict 
community assembly (Shipley 2010; Spasojevic 
and Suding 2012) and ecosystem functions (Des 
Roches et  al. 2018; Lavorel et  al. 2011; Maynard 
et al. 2019; Suding et al. 2008). Currently, most such 
studies employ community-weighted trait means 
to explain biodiversity and ecosystem functions 
that are maintained by a community (e.g. Liu et al. 
2015). Such community-weighted means neglect the 
ubiquitous intraspecific trait variability, arising from 
intraspecific genetic variation and/or phenotypic 
plasticity. Therefore, this mean field approach may 
underestimate the degree of trait or niche dispersion 
among species and the resources they exploit and 
result in misinterpreting the mechanisms of species 
coexistence and various ecosystem processes (Albert 
et al. 2011; Bolnick et al. 2011; Turcotte and Levine 
2016; Violle et al. 2012).
While interspecific trait variation is often the most 
important source of trait variation when comparing 
between communities along strong environmental 
gradients (Jung et al. 2010; Siefert et al. 2015), its 
contribution to the overall trait variation depends 
strongly on the spatial scale at which the study is 
done and on the traits (Albert et  al. 2011; Auger 
and Shipley 2013; Jung et  al. 2010). In some 
cases, intraspecific trait variation contributes more 
to the total trait variation in a community than 
interspecific trait variation (de Bello et  al. 2011; 
Messier et al. 2010; Siefert et al. 2015). Furthermore, 
inter- and intraspecific trait variation can occur 
both within a single local community and between 
local communities (Supplementary Table S1). As 
a result, intraspecific trait variation can be further 
decomposed into variability within communities 
(ITVwithin) and among communities (ITVamong) as 
formalized in Lepš et al. (2011) and de Bello et al. 
(2011). ITVwithin measures trait variation between 
individuals of the same species growing in the same 
community (Albert 2015; de Bello et al. 2011; Siefert 
et  al. 2015), while ITVamong measures the spread 
of trait values between individuals of the same 
species growing in different communities. Several 
studies have now quantified these components of 
intraspecific variation under different conditions, 
including nitrogen and water addition (Lü et  al. 
2018), short- or long-term management (Volf 
et  al. 2016), elevation gradients (Kichenin et  al. 
2013) and sandy grassland restoration (Zuo et  al. 
2017). As a meta-analysis, Siefert et  al. (2015) 
reported that ITVwithin accounted for 25% of the 
total trait variation within communities and 32% 
of the total trait variation among communities on 
average worldwide. However, the fact that a trait 
displays substantial intraspecific variation does 
not necessarily mean that such intraspecific trait 
variation is an important determinant of ecosystem 
processes. It remains unclear about how interspecific 
and intraspecific sources of variability, both within 
and among local communities drives ecosystem 
functions (e.g. NPP).

Plant height is generally considered important for 
light acquisition and competition (Bjorkman et al. 
2018; Westoby 1998), and thus has an important 
impact on aboveground net primary production 
(ANPP). On the one hand, in light-limited habitats, 
all individuals, especially shaded individuals under 
reduced light would invest a large amount of energy 
into supporting tissue (e.g. via stem elongation) 
to reach as much light as possible, resulting in 
increasing height of different species (i.e. ‘shade-
avoidance syndrome’; Roscher et  al. 2015). Thus, 
intraspecific trait variation in plant height within a 
community (ITVwithin) may increase the utilization 
efficiency of light resources, ultimately increasing 
productivity by increasing niche partitioning and 
decreasing niche overlap (i.e. complementary 
effect) (Fahey et  al. 2015; Gough et  al. 2019). On 
the other hand, intraspecific variation in height 
among communities (ITVamong) and average fixed 
height (CWMfixed) may also benefit productivity 
because communities consisting of taller individuals 
can access light more easily and synthesize more 
photosynthetic compounds (i.e. intraspecific and 
interspecific ‘selection effect’, respectively; Liu 
et  al. 2017). These points suggest that both the 
community-weighted mean values of height and 
its levels of intraspecific trait variation could affect 
variation in aboveground net primary productivity 
but what is the relative importance of each? No 
study to date has considered both together and, 
since previous research has focused mostly on 
community-weighted means, it is possible that 
ecologists are missing an important intraspecific 
trait effect.
Experimental removal is a useful approach not 
only to investigate the influences of nonrandom 
loss of species or functional groups on ecosystem 
functions (Díaz et al. 2003; Kardol et al. 2018; Liu 
et al. 2015), but also to explore how plant functional 
trait variation mediate the change of ANPP in 
response to biodiversity loss. Compared with 
sampling on natural communities, removal leads to 
greater variation in not only productivity, but also 
functional diversity (Díaz et al. 2003; e.g. changes 
in community composition and species traits, 
including inter- and intraspecific variation). Thus, 
removal created a functional diversity–productivity 
pattern along a functional group richness gradient. 
Controlled experiments could also create that 
pattern, however, removal can more realistically 
mimic natural community composition with less 
changes of external variables (Díaz et  al. 2003). 
For example, nitrogen addition would result in 
significant changes in various abiotic factors, e.g. soil 
N enrichment and acidification (Zhang et al. 2020). 
In a previous study, we found that average fixed 
plant height caused by functional group identity is a 
powerful functional trait predictor for productivity 
in an alpine meadow (Liu et  al. 2015). However, 
we did not assess the role of intraspecific variability 
of plant height in biomass production. Here, using 
data from this 4-year removal experiment, in 
which we manipulated the number and identity of 
different functional groups, we quantify the relative 
contributions of interspecific (TVinter and CWMfixed, 
Supplementary Table S1) and intraspecific trait 
variation (ITVwithin and ITVamong) in plant height in 
determining primary productivity. Specifically, 
we test the following hypotheses: (i) productivity 
increases with increasing levels of intraspecific trait 
variation (including ITVwithin and ITVamong), when 
the community has the same types of species and 
has species with the same average fixed height (i.e. 
besides interspecific variation); (ii) the combination 
of intraspecific variability and interspecific variability 
explains more variation in productivity than either 
of these effects alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study site
Our study site was located in the eastern part 
of the Tibetan Plateau (35°58′ N, 101°53″ E) 
at approximately 3500 m a.s.l. The average 
annual precipitation is 620  mm, which is mainly 
concentrated 
in 
the 
summer. 
Mean 
annual 
temperature is 1.2  °C, and monthly temperature 
ranges from −10.7 to 11.7 °C. The alpine meadow 
is rich in species diversity, having more than 30 
species within a 50 cm × 50 cm subplot (Liu et al. 
2017), and is dominated by perennial herbaceous 
species of the families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, 
Asteraceae and Fabaceae, such as Elymus nutans, 
Kobresia myosuroides, Stipa aliena, Ligularia virgaurea, 
Saussurea pulchra and Thermopsis lanceolala. The 
soil is typical alpine meadow soil (Genetic Soil 
Classification of China) with a depth of 80  cm 
(Liu et  al. 2015), and is classified as Cambosols 
(Chinese Soil Taxonomy) (Shi et al. 2006).
Experimental design and data sampling
In June 2011, we established a functional group 
removal experiment in a 50 m × 50 m fenced area,

with yak grazing permitted from September to 
May. Seventy-five 1 m diameter circular plots were 
arranged regularly, separated by three meters from 
adjacent edges. All 54 species found in the study 
site were classified into four groups (hereafter 
functional groups because they differ functionally) 
based on their physical, reproductive and dispersal 
attributes: Poaceae and Cyperaceae (abbreviated 
as ‘A’), Asteraceae (B), Fabaceae (C) and Others 
(D), which have been described in Table A1 in 
Liu et al. (2015). All possible combinations of the 
four taxonomic groups consisted of 24 − 1  =  15 
treatments (Treatment: ABCD, ABC, ABD, BCD, 
ACD, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A, B, C, D), 
which were assigned randomly to plots, with five 
replicates for each treatment. These plots were 
maintained by removing the aboveground biomass 
of the nonfocal functional groups of species twice a 
year (in June and July, respectively). For example, 
the ‘A’ treatment (only species of Poaceae and 
Cyperaceae) was maintained by removing species 
belonging to the Asteraceae (B), Fabaceae (C) and 
Others (D).
We recorded species richness and each species’ 
abundance (i.e. number of ramets) in a circular 
subplot of 50 cm diameter in the center of each plot 
in August (the peaking growing season) from 2012 
to 2014 annually. All the aboveground parts present 
in each subplot were harvested using scissors at the 
soil surface, dried at 65 °C for 48 h and then weighed 
to 0.1  mg to estimate productivity (measured as 
annual aboveground biomass production). We also 
randomly selected and recorded the maximum 
height (including reproductive structures) of up to 
five individuals per species within each subplot in 
2012, and up to 10 individuals per species in 2013 
and 2014 for a total of 15 536 individuals’ heights 
across 75 plots.
Calculating ITV
By using the variance partitioning method proposed 
by de Bello et  al. (2011), we partitioned the total 
variability in height within a specific community 
into abundance-weighted interspecific (TVinter) and 
intraspecific variability (ITVwithin):
TVinter =
S
i=1 ai(xi −community-weighted mean)2
S
i=1 ai

(1)
Community-weighted mean =
S
i=1 aixi
S
i=1 ai

(2)
ITVwithin =

Nind
Nind
j=1 (xji −xi)2
S
i=1 ai

(3)
Total variability = TVinter + ITVwithin

(4)
where S is the number of sampled species in a subplot 
(community), ai is the abundance of the ith species 
in the subplot and xi is the average height of the ith 
species in the given community. The community-
weighted mean of height is the mean of species height 
weighted by their relative abundance in a subplot. xji 
is the height value of the ith species at the individual 
level, and Nind is the number of sampling individuals 
of the ith species. TVinter, also called the community-
weighted variance (Shipley 2010), represents the 
difference between the height of a given species in a 
community and the average height of all individuals 
in that community.
We also calculated the community-weighted mean 
caused by species turnover alone (CWMfixed) and by 
ITVamong alone following Lepš et al. (2011). CWMfixed 
indicates the community expected average height 
based on its constituent individuals. It is affected only 
by species turnover, which can be calculated as:
CWMf ixed =
S
i=1 aixf ixed
S
i=1 ai

(5)
where xfixed is the fixed height average of the ith 
species over all sampling communities. ITVamong in 
each plot is the difference between community-
weighted mean and CWMfixed:
ITVamong = community-weighted mean −CWMf ixed

(6)
A positive ITVamong indicates that the community 
average height in a subplot is taller than expected 
(CWMfixed), while a negative ITVamong means lower.
Statistical analysis
Our 
hypotheses 
concerned 
the 
relationship 
between 
community 
productivity 
and 
four 
predictor variables: TVinter, ITVwithin, ITVamong and 
CWMfixed. However, community productivity could 
potentially be affected directly by the treatment 
manipulations and/or by biodiversity changes 
induced by these treatments (the number of 
functional groups, species richness, Shannon’s 
evenness index, Simpson’s diversity index and 
phylogenetic diversity), as shown in Liu et  al. 
(2015). If so, then correlations between community 
productivity and our four predictor variables could

be spurious and reflect the common effects of 
the treatment manipulations or the biodiversity 
changes. We therefore tested our hypotheses in 
two steps.
First, we regressed community productivity in 
each of the subplots on the categorical treatment 
manipulation or on each of the measured biodiversity 
changes, in order to determine how best to control 
for such possible spurious patterns. Since we had no 
a priori reason to assume linearity, these regressions 
were done using generalized additive mixed models 
via the gam function of the mgcv library of R (Wood 
2017), in which the predictor variables were added 
as fixed smoothed terms via penalized thin plate 
regression splines with both random intercepts and 
slopes over years. We used AIC (Akaike information 
criterion) statistics (see below) to choose the best of 
these variables as a covariate to serve as our ‘null’ 
model for comparison. We found that the categorical 
treatment variable itself, rather than the number of 
functional groups, species richness, Shannon’s index, 
Simpson’s index or phylogenetic diversity, was the 
best single explanatory variable for community 
productivity. Since the ΔAICc (AIC corrected for 
small sample sizes) for all of these biodiversity indices 
were >54.658 relative to the treatment variable, 
‘Treatment’ defined the ‘null’ model (Supplementary 
Table S2).
Second, we also conducted model selection by 
regressing community productivity on the treatment 
factor (which we use as the ‘null’ model) plus each 
possible combination of the four predictor variables 
(TVinter, ITVwithin, ITVamong and CWMfixed). A  series 
of generalized additive mixed models with year 
as random intercepts and slopes were performed. 
Spearman’s correlation tests were performed using 
the cor.test function in the stats package to avoid 
including strong correlation indices in any model if 
Spearman’s ρ > 0.5 (Supplementary Table S3). We 
also tested the influences of the trait variabilities (total 
variability, TVinter, ITVwithin, community-weighted 
mean, CWMfixed and ITVamong) on productivity after 
controlling for Treatment in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 
respectively, using the same approach used for 
data across all the years combined. We calculated 
information-theoretic Akaike’s information criterion 
corrected for small samples sizes (AICc), the change 
in AICc relative to the model with lowest AIC (i.e. 
ΔAICc). Following Burnham and Anderson (2010), 
the model with the lowest AICc has the most support, 
models with ΔAICc >3 having considerably less 
support and models with ΔAICc >7 having essentially 
no support.
Furthermore, we used piecewise structural 
equation modeling (SEM) to test how the presence 
of four functional groups affected plant inter- and 
intraspecific variability indices (i.e. TVinter, ITVwithin, 
ITVamong and CWMfixed), and then influenced 
community productivity (see an initial causal model 
in Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, ‘presence of 
A’ consisted of all the treatments that included A (i.e. 
A, AB, AC, AD, ABC, ABD, ACD and ABCD). Standard 
path coefficients (β), corresponding significance (P 
values) for each path and global goodness of fits of 
the final model were evaluated using psem function 
in piecewiseSEM package (Lefcheck 2016), which 
based on a d-sep approach (Shipley 2016). All 
statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.6.1 (R Core 
Team 2019).
RESULTS
Across 3  years, intraspecific trait variation among 
communities (ITVamong) was a significantly positive 
predictor of productivity (Estimate ± SE  =  1.346  ± 
0.322, P  <  0.05) after controlling for the effects of 
Treatment and CWMfixed, while ITVwithin did not 
account for a significant proportion of the remaining 
variance (Estimate ± SE = −0.030 ± 0.037, P = 0.408) 
after controlling for the effects of Treatment, 
CWMfixed and ITVamong (Fig. 1). During the study 
period, and after controlling for the Treatment effect, 
productivity was significantly and positively related 
to ITVamong except in 2014 (Supplementary Fig. S2). 
In contrast, the effect of ITVwithin on productivity 
ranged from no significant effect to a positive effect 
after controlling for the Treatment effect from 2012 
to 2014 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Productivity 
was significantly and positively related to both 
community-weighted mean and CWMfixed in each 
year (Supplementary Fig. S2), while the effect of 
total variation and TVinter on productivity weakened 
from 2012 to 2014 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The best model, accounting for 82.6% of the 
variance in productivity, involved the treatment 
and linear functions of CWMfixed  +  ITVamong 
(Table 1; Supplementary Table S2). Experimentally 
changing the types of species in the community 
(the treatment) affected subsequent productivity 
(Supplementary Table S2). While the treatment 
accounted 
for 
71.6% 
of 
the 
variance 
in 
productivity, the addition of CWMfixed to the

treatment accounted for an additional 3.5% of 
variance while adding ITVamong to the treatment 
accounted for an additional 9.1%. Adding both 
to the treatment resulted in an additional 11% of 
explained variance in productivity rather than an 
additional 3.5% + 9.1% since CWMfixed and ITVamong 
shared some common variance (Spearman’s 
ρ = 0.234, Supplementary Table S3). Each of these 
variables was significant predictors of productivity 
(P < 0.05). The second-best model (ΔAICc = 1.819) 
contained these same variables plus a linear 
function of ITVwithin, accounting for almost the 
same proportion of the variance in productivity. 
All other models had ΔAICc values of >20.610 and 
could be essentially excluded from consideration. 
CWMfixed was a significantly positive predictor 
of productivity (Estimate ± SE  =  0.799  ± 0.158, 
P  <  0.05, Fig. 1) after controlling for Treatment 
and ITVamong (P  <  0.05). TVinter did not have a 
significant effect on productivity after controlling 
for Treatment (Table 1).
The final piecewise SEM explained 79% of the 
variation in community productivity, which fitted the 
data adequately (Fisher’s C = 4.49, df = 2, P = 0.106, 
Fig. 2). The presence of the functional group Poaceae 
and Cyperaceae (A, β = 0.632, P < 0.001), Asteraceae 
(B, β = −0.160, P < 0.001) and Others (D, β = −0.225, 
P  <  0.001) significantly affect CWMfixed, while the 
presence of functional group Poaceae and Cyperaceae 
(A, β = −0.272, P = 0.004) and Others (D, β = 0.179, 
P  =  0.005) significantly affect ITVamong. From this 
final piecewise SEM, while our treatment (i.e. the 
presence of four functional group) had direct effect on 
productivity, it also had indirect effect on productivity 
via plant traits variability (including intraspecific 
variability). The results of the final piecewise SEM 
(Fig. 2) and generalized additive mixed model (Fig. 1) 
were similar, further confirming CWMfixed (β = 0.309, 
P < 0.001) and ITVamong (β = 0.303, P < 0.001) were 
significantly positive predictors of productivity after 
controlling for treatment.
DISCUSSION
In recent years, ecologists have endeavored to 
incorporate functional traits in studies of community 
ecology. 
Intraspecific 
trait 
variability, 
which 
until recently has been largely overshadowed by 
interspecific trait variability, is receiving increasing 
interest (Albert et al. 2011; Bolnick et al. 2011; Siefert 
et  al. 2015; Turcotte and Levine 2016; Violle et  al. 
2012). However, until now, most studies have focused 
on assessing the relative extent of intraspecific trait 
variability in functional traits (e.g. leaf nitrogen 
and phosphorus content, height, shoot biomass) 
compared with interspecific variation under different 
environmental conditions (Kichenin et al. 2013; Lepš 
et al. 2011; Lü et al. 2018; Siefert et al. 2015; Volf et al. 
2016), leaving their effects on ecosystem functions 
largely unknown. In this paper, we partitioned 
total variability in plant height within each of 75 
manipulated communities into two additive parts to 
assess their relative importance for explaining the

variation of productivity in response to functional 
group removal. This allows us to answer the two 
questions posed in this paper. First, community 
productivity does increase with increasing levels of 
intraspecific trait variation between communities 
(ITVamong) but there is must less evidence for an effect 
of intraspecific trait variation within a community 
(ITVwithin). Second, the combination of intraspecific 
variability and interspecific variability explains 
more variation in productivity than either of these 
effects alone.
Fixed community-weighted means (CWMfixed) 
have been widely adopted to examine the functional 
diversity–community 
productivity 
relationship, 
with traits averaged over a range of environmental 
conditions (e.g. Liu et  al. 2015), or extracted from 
a broad trait database (Cornelissen et  al. 2003; 
Geng et  al. 2017; Kleyer et  al. 2008; Lepš et  al. 
2011). The fixed community-weighted mean only

This table comes from the full table shown in Supplementary Table S2, by performing 12 generalized additive mixed models 
(setting ‘Treatment’ as the ‘null’ model) for productivity as a function of nonlinear terms, i.e. interspecific variability 
(TVinter), intraspecific variability with community (ITVwithin), species turnover (CWMfixed) and intraspecific variability 
among community (ITVamong). The horizontal axis is degree of freedom (df), corrected information-theoretic Akaike’s 
information criterion for small samples sizes (AICc), changes in AICc relative to the top-ranked model (ΔAICc), AICc weight 
(wAICc = model probability) and the variance explained by generalized additive mixed models (R2
adj, using gam function). 
For performing generalized additive mixed models, we set ‘year’ as random intercepts and slopes. Variable highlighted in 
bold shows a significant effect (P < 0.05). The model with the lowest AICc has the most support, models with ΔAICc >3 have 
relatively little support and models with ΔAICc >7 have essentially no support.

reflects species’ average trait values irrespective 
of the environment (Lepš et  al. 2011; Siefert et  al. 
2015). In our study site, species from different 
functional groups possess different typical heights 
(Fig. 2; Liu et  al. 2015). Hence, we expected that 
differences between the experimental functional 
group removal treatments would lead to different 
impacts on light acquisition and competition of the 
remaining plants, and thus community productivity 
(Bjorkman et al. 2018; Westoby 1998). As found in 
other studies (Chanteloup and Bonis 2013; Fu et al. 
2014), our results showed that after controlling for 
these experimental differences, increasing fixed 
community-weighted mean height (CWMfixed) was 
associated with increasing productivity, with an 
increase of 1  cm in CWMfixed of height increased 
productivity by 0.799 ± 0.158 g/subplot (i.e. 0.196 
m2). The positive relationship between productivity 
and 
fixed 
community-weighted 
mean 
height 
can be explained by the ‘selection effect’. That 
is, communities dominated by taller species will 
tend to have higher biomass productivities. This is 
expected both because greater height usually results 
in greater aboveground biomass in these herbaceous 
communities and because taller individuals can more 
easily access light in competition, allowing them 
to synthesize photosynthetic compounds and then 
convert them to even more biomass (Anten and 
Hirose 2001; Falster and Westoby 2003).
More interestingly, the best model and SEM 
showed that intraspecific variation in height among 
communities having the same types of species 
(treatment) and having species with the same 
average fixed height (i.e. CWMfixed), also resulted 
in higher productivity, since ITVamong was just as 
important a predictor as the CWMfixed heights. 
However, the presence of different functional groups 
affected ANPP through different indirect pathways, 
i.e. via CWMfixed and/or ITVamong (Fig. 2), suggesting 
ANPP variation mainly caused by selecting higher 
species and/or species who could grow higher. An 
increase in the difference between the intraspecific 
height of a species among subplots relative to its 
average height (ITVamong) of 1  cm increased the 
productivity by 1.346 ± 0.322 g/subplot (i.e. 0.196 
m2). The occurrence of a positive effect of intraspecific 
variability in plant height on productivity may reflect 
a ‘shade-avoidance syndrome’. That is, all individuals, 
especially shaded individuals would invest a large 
amount of energy into stem elongation, resulting in 
increasing height of different species (Roscher et al. 
2015). This intraspecific selection is presumably 
some 
combination 
of 
genetic 
selection 
and 
phenotypic plasticity although we cannot separate 
the two sources in our study. The effect of ITVamong 
on productivity ranged from significantly positive to 
nonexistent after controlling for the Treatment effect 
from 2012 to 2014, which might suggest that the 
possibility of higher productivity caused by selecting 
taller individuals of the same species had been used 
up over the first 3 years.
We found that TVinter (i.e. height variation among 
species within a community) was not included in the 
two best models, and ITVwithin (i.e. height variation 
within species within a community) showed no 
significant effects on productivity although it was 
included in the second-best model. Increased 
productivity with ITVwithin and TVinter may result 
from structural complexity (e.g. canopy rugosity, 
Gough et  al. 2019), which led to increased light 
acquirement and light use efficiency via greater 
space filling and higher occupy of light environment. 
However, from 2012 to 2014, the effect of ITVwithin 
on productivity ranged from no significant effect to 
a positive effect, and the effect of TVinter varied from 
significantly positive to nonexistent after controlling 
for the Treatment effect. This may suggest that the 
positive effect of intraspecific height difference on 
productivity became increasingly important over 
time. Thus, it would also be important to study the 
response of other traits that plastically respond to 
light intensity, and how this phenotypical plasticity 
contributing to ecosystem functioning.
Although 
both 
intraspecific 
variability 
and 
interspecific variability positively contributed to 
productivity, the combination of them explained 
more variation in productivity than either of these 
effects alone in our study. This suggests that both 
selection effect and a ‘shade-avoidance syndrome’ 
could incur higher CWMfixed or ITVamong, and even 
niche differentiation induced structural complexity 
that could cause higher ITVwithin, may simultaneously 
operate to regulate productivity in this study.
In conclusion, this study shows that the additional 
explanatory power of intra- and interspecific trait 
variability in height are comparable in magnitude. It 
provides new evidence that intraspecific trait variability 
in plant height should not be ignored when predicting 
productivity. Future studies considering more than 
one trait to quantify intraspecific trade-offs among life-
history constraints between traits may largely broaden 
our understanding of the importance of intraspecific 
trait variability in maintaining ecosystem functions.

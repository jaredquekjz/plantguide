Abstract
The role of plant community structure and plant functional traits for above- and
belowground carbon (C) ﬂuxes was studied for 2 years in a mesocosm experiment with
grassland monoliths, using continuous gas exchange measurements and soil analyses.
Here we test the response-and-effect trait hypothesis, by applying a mathematical
framework used to predict changes in C ﬂuxes after a change in disturbance through
the community response (R) and effect (E) traits. Monoliths were extracted from two
contrasted long-term ﬁeld treatments (high vs. low grazing disturbance) and exposed to
both low and high (simulated grazing) disturbance during a 2 years experiment. Carbon
dioxide exchanges were measured continuously in an open ﬂow system. Net ecosystem
productivity and ecosystem C balance were positively correlated at low disturbance with
plant species richness. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil C
sequestration were, however, unrelated to these variables. Community aggregated leaf
(speciﬁc leaf area, leaf dry-matter content) and root and rhizome (speciﬁc length, tissue
density, diameter) traits responded (R) signiﬁcantly to changes in disturbance, indicating
an increased dominance of conservative plant growth strategies at low compared with
high disturbance. Applying the mathematical framework, ANPP was predicted by
distribution of leaf traits within the community (functional divergence), while mean
root and rhizome traits had signiﬁcant effects (E) on soil C sequestration, irrespective of
the experimental disturbance and of the year. According to highly signiﬁcant linear
regression models, between 6% and 61% of the transient changes in soil C sequestration
resulted from community root and rhizome (response-and-effect) traits after a change in
disturbance.

Introduction
Predicting ecosystem responses to global change has
become a major challenge in ecology (Chapin et al.,
1998; Loreau et al., 2001), particularly as terrestrial
ecosystems contribute to the mitigation of global cli-
mate change through carbon (C) sequestration in the
soil and vegetation (IPCC, 2007). Grasslands are one of
the major biomes worldwide and temperate grasslands
contribute to ca. 10% of the global organic C content in
soils (IPCC, 2000). Changes in C ﬂuxes were suggested
to be greatest where disturbance (e.g. ﬁre, grazing) has
induced shifts in grassland communities, that alter the
use and availability of key resources (Chapin et al.,
2002). Thus, a better understanding of the coupling
between plant diversity and C cycling is essential for
predicting ecosystem services under global change.
Biodiversity experiments have shown causal relation-
ships between species number, ecosystem productivity
(e.g. Tilman et al., 1997; Hector et al., 1999; Ro¨scher et al.,
2005) and C sequestration (Tilman et al., 2006). Despite
an increasing agreement on the role of plant species
diversity for ecosystem processes and resulting ecosys-
tem services (Hooper et al., 2005), very little is known
about the role of plant traits which are mediated by
plant species (Chapin et al., 2000; Lavorel & Garnier,
2002; Diaz et al., 2007a).

In the mass ratio hypothesis, Grime (1998) suggested
that the extent to which the trait of a species affects
ecosystem properties strongly depends on the relative
contribution to the total biomass of that species. Accord-
ingly, ecosystem processes (e.g. C cycling, De Deyn
et al., 2008) would be determined by aggregated traits
of dominant species. The distribution of trait values
within the community, the functional divergence repre-
sents the degree of overlap in trait values within a
community (Mason et al., 2005). The role of commu-
nity-aggregated plant functional traits and functional
divergence (Diaz et al., 2007b; Mokany et al., 2008) has
been shown for aboveground net primary productivity
(Garnier et al., 2004; Da S. Pontes et al., 2007), shoot litter
decomposability (Aerts et al., 2003; Kazakou et al., 2006;
Diaz et al., 2007a) and C-cycling (see Wardle et al., 2004;
Bardgett et al., 2005; De Deyn & Van der Putten, 2005),
but has never been evidenced for soil C sequestration.
It has been shown that ecosystem responses to en-
vironmental changes occur as a result of (i) sorting
processes among individuals with appropriate response
traits (Weiher, 1998; Grime, 2006) and (ii) changes in
ecosystem-effect-traits (Diaz & Cabido, 2001; Lavorel &
Garnier, 2002; Diaz et al., 2007b; Violle et al., 2007).
Suding et al. (2008) proposed a framework incorporat-
ing functional traits to predict effects of environmental
change on ecosystem.
This framework differentiates between environmen-
tal response (response traits) and effects of environ-
mental change on ecosystem processes (effect traits)
(e.g. Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). The relationship between
response (R) and effect (E) traits, while a system under-
goes a change, plays an important role in predicting
ecosystem functioning. For example, traits that are
co-related are presumably both predictive of response
and effect (Gross et al., 2008). Therefore, changes in
ecosystem functioning after environmental change will
be partly mediated by community dynamics (Suding
et al., 2008). Given the paucity of empirical tests to
validate this approach, more experiments are needed
where species contribution to ecosystem processes are
related to environmental changes and effect traits of a
certain species or group (e.g. Reich et al., 2001; Craine
et al., 2002; Garnier et al., 2004).
The impact of environmental changes on C seques-
tration has been shown for a range of European grass-
land sites (Soussana et al., 2007), where net ecosystem C
storage was found to decline with disturbance by graz-
ing and cutting. A mesocosm study with a seminatural
grassland showed that net ecosystem productivity
(NEP) and belowground net C storage (BNCS) did not
vary 2 years after changes in disturbance regime, but
were signiﬁcantly higher for monoliths acclimated for
14 years to a low, compared with a high, pre-experi-
mental (ﬁeld) disturbance (Klumpp et al., 2007a). More-
over,
the
decay
of
soil
organic
matter
fraction
(40.2 mm) was slower at low compared to high pre-
experimental disturbance (Klumpp et al., 2007b). The
disturbance regime in the ﬁeld (before mesocosm ex-
periment) had carry-over effects on NEP and soil
C storage [calculated by both gas exchange balance
and soil organic carbon analyses, Klumpp et al.,
2007a], presumably due to plant community dynamics
(Paterson, 2003).
Here we analyzed the role of plant community struc-
ture and traits for C ﬂuxes in the same mesocosm
experiment.
Initially
we
test
the
effects
of
ﬁeld
(pre-experimental) and experimental disturbance on
plant community structure and community-scale traits.
We provide for the ﬁrst time a mathematical method
to test Suding’s (Suding et al., 2008) hypothesis,
that changes in C ﬂuxes after environmental change
can be predicted from the community response (R) and
effect (E) traits, and we assess the role of aggregated
traits and of functional divergence for shoot traits,
following the framework recently proposed by Diaz
et al. (2007b).
Materials and methods
Mesocosm experiment with grassland monoliths
The study was carried out at Clermont Ferrand, France,
using monoliths (each 0.5 m  0.5 m  0.4 m) from an
upland grassland site. The grassland studied (vegeta-
tion, soil) and the procedures used to select and extract
grassland monoliths have been previously described by
Klumpp et al. (2007a). In June 2002, 56 pasture mono-
liths were sampled from two permanent (14 years)
seminatural grassland plots, of contrasting sheep graz-
ing regimes, without fertilizer applications (Loiseau
et al., 2005; Louault et al., 2005). Field plot 1 was cut
once and sheep grazed 4 times yr1 and therefore re-
presented a high disturbance regime (H). Field plot 2
was sheep grazed once a year (low disturbance regime,
L). Following extraction, each monolith was placed in a
ﬁve-sided stainless-steel box with drain holes at the
bottom. Twenty-four monoliths from each ﬁeld plot
(pre-experimental H and L) were placed at random in
eight transparent (polyethylene ﬁlm, 60 mm) canopy
enclosures (1.5 m  0.5 m  0.75 m). Each canopy enclo-
sure therefore contained three monoliths from the same
disturbance treatment.
The 16 canopy enclosures were exposed to natural
light. Enclosures were part of an open-ﬂow gas-ex-
change system (see Klumpp et al., 2007a), where tem-
perature and humidity of enclosure inlet air was
adjusted to outdoors conditions by a computer con-
2922

trolled cooling system and air humidiﬁer, respectively.
The experiment commenced in April 2003, whereupon
the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the enclo-
sures was maintained, from sunrise to sunset, compar-
able to the outdoor CO2 concentration (mean difference
of 13.2  9.5 mmol mol1) by injection of CO2 (Klumpp
et al., 2007a).
Depending on season, monoliths were watered be-
tween one and three times a week to target a soil
volumetric water content of 33%, corresponding to a
soil water potential of ca. 30 kPa. All enclosures re-
ceived the same irrigation volumes.
Management and treatments
In September 2002, the canopy enclosures were closed
and supplied with ambient air to adapt vegetation
to enclosure conditions. At the start of the experiment,
half of the enclosures per treatment (4, i.e. 12 monoliths)
were switched to the opposite disturbance regime
(HL and LH, crossed treatments), while half of the
enclosures remained with the same disturbance level
(HH and LL). Therefore, we applied a high disturbance
(i.e. cut) to half the monoliths with pre-experimental
low disturbance level (HL) and a low disturbance (un-
cut) to half the monoliths previously exposed to a high
disturbance regime (LH). Hence, changes in distur-
bance level (HL and LH) can be compared with controls
(HH, LL) in a fully factorial design, with four replicate
enclosures per treatment.
On ﬁve occasions per year the monoliths of the
experimental high disturbance regime HH and LH
(24 and 4 controls) were cut simultaneously at 5 cm
stubble height. Artiﬁcial urine (in average 5 g N m2 per
event, see Klumpp et al., 2007a) was applied evenly
following each cut, in order to simulate N returns
at grazing. The remaining monoliths of the experi-
mental low disturbance regime LL and HL (24) were
neither cut nor fertilized. The harvested phytomass
was separated into live and dead plant parts, oven
dried for 48 h at 60 1C and weighed. At the start and
at the end of each growing season (in April and Sep-
tember) the standing aboveground biomass (including
stubbles) was measured on half a monolith, in each
enclosure.
C ﬂuxes
The air ﬂow and CO2 concentration in each open-ﬂow
canopy enclosure was monitored continuously during
the 2 years of the experiment. The above and soil CO2
ﬂuxes were calculated for each enclosure from these
airﬂows and from changes in CO2 concentrations (see
Klumpp et al., 2007a for full details). Gross primary
productivity (GPP) was the net photosynthesis (Pn) plus
estimated daytime canopy dark respiration (Rd, see
Casella & Soussana, 1997). The NEP, was the net photo-
synthesis (Pn) minus aboveground (night-time, Rp) and
soil (Rs) respiration. The annual total net carbon storage
(NCS) in the monoliths was Pn minus total respiration
(Rs 1 Rp) and minus annual C yield by cut (Chapin
et al., 2002). The aboveground net primary productivity
(ANPP), of enclosures exposed to high disturbance
levels (HH and LH), was the sum of the annual C yield
by cut plus the C content of stubbles in September (date
of peak biomass). For enclosures exposed to a low
disturbance level (LL and HL), the ANPP was deﬁned
as the standing dead and live aboveground phytomass
in September, plus stubbles, in order to integrate part of
the biomass turnover during growing season (e.g. Scur-
lock et al., 2002). Speciﬁc aboveground net primary
productivity (SANPP), was the difference between
log-transformed values of ﬁnal and initial aboveground
biomass divided by days of regrowth and growing
season for cut and uncut monoliths. The BNCS was
then calculated as the NEP minus the ANPP.
Soil organic C content
Soils were sampled once before the start of the experi-
ment and then after 12 and 24 months. At each soil
harvest, the 0–10 cm layer was air dried and the free
organic matter fractions (OM) 4200mm (fast decompos-
ing soil pool) were separated with water by wet sieving
(Klumpp et al., 2007a, b). Their C content was then
analysed by an elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba Instru-
ments, CNS NA 1500, ThermoFinnigan, Milan, Italy).
The top soil organic carbon (SOC) content 40.2 mm
was in average 10.7 (7.5), 6.2 (5.0), 5.0 (4.3), and
2.5 (3.3) mg C g1 soil for LL, LH, HL and HH treatment
in the ﬁrst and second (parenthesis) year of the experi-
ment. Year factor had no effect on SOC content, while
SOC was signiﬁcantly higher for monoliths of low pre-
experimental and experimental disturbance, than for
monoliths managed with a high disturbance regime
(data not shown).
Plant community structure
Point quadrat measurements of plant species composi-
tion were carried out after monolith extraction in Sep-
tember
2002
and
then
ﬁve
times
during
the
experimental period (May and October 2003, April
and July 2004, April 2005). During the experiment
(September 2002 to April 2005) the mean observation
area for plant species community was 0.5 m2. Presence/
absence of species was recorded at 16 points per mono-
lith (see Klumpp et al., 2007a) by moving a pin down-

wards, which could hit more than one species. Shan-
non’s diversity index (H0) was calculated as
H0 ¼
X
i
ðpi log piÞ;
ð1Þ
where pi is the presence of species i.
Leaf traits
Leaf traits, for plant species 45% presence, were mea-
sured on four occasions (June 2003, April and July 2004,
April 2005), 1 week after the point quadrat measure-
ments. Measured plant traits were vegetative height,
leaf mass ratio, speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry-
matter content (LDMC) (methodologies see Garnier
et al., 2001; Louault et al., 2005).
For each enclosure and each sampling date, aggre-
gated community scale trait values were calculated by
weighing the individual trait value of species i (Ti) by its
percentage presence (pi) in the plant community (Gar-
nier et al., 2004). The community aggregated trait values
(Tc) is
Tc ¼ ð1=sÞ

piTi;
ð2Þ
where s is the number of plant species in the commu-
nity. The distribution (i.e. overlap) of trait values within
the community, the functional divergence (FD), was
calculated from species relative abundance and species
leaf traits (SLA, LDMC, leaf mass ratio and mean
height) using Rao’s index, and was either used indivi-
dually or averaged (FDvg) across all traits (methodolo-
gies see Mason et al., 2005; Lepsˇ et al., 2006)

where dij is the distance between i-th and j-th species in
a community, and pi and pj are the relative abundance of
species i and j respectively, and s is the number of
species in the community.
Root and rhizome traits
Belowground traits were measured from fresh soil
samples of the September 2003 and April 2005 soil
harvest. On both occasions, a vertical soil slice was
sampled (50 cm  6 cm) from the top soil layer (10 cm)
of a monolith per enclosure. After washing on a 1 mm
sieve, two subsamples were taken. A ﬁrst subsample
was sorted by hand into coarse roots (i.e. primary
roots), ﬁne roots and rhizomes. A second subsample
was used to determine community root and rhizome
traits. The following traits were measured: speciﬁc
length
(SL,
m g1 DM),
tissue
density
(DENS,
g DM cm3), diameter (D, mm) and nitrogen content
(NC, g N g1 DM) (for methodology, see Roumet et al.,
2006).
Trait based response-and-effect framework
An ecosystem function (Y) applied to a plant commu-
nity at time (t1) can be broken down, according to the
mass ratio hypothesis (Grime, 1998), in terms of the per-
gram or per-capita effect (Ejt1) of a species j and its
current abundance (njt1), where E is an effect trait. Using
a trait-based prediction of the response to a changed
environment (t2), the abundance of species j in the new
environment (njt2) is predicted to be njt1 Rj, where R is a
response trait. According to Suding et al. (2008), follow-
ing a change in environment (from time 1 to time 2), the
contribution of a given species j, to future ecosystem
function Y2, can be assumed to be a function of the
effect of a species on Y and its predicted abundance njt2.
Hence as shown by Suding et al. (2008)
Y2 ¼
X
j¼1
fðnjt2EjÞ;
Y2 ¼
X
j¼1
fðnjt1Rj; EjÞ:
ð4Þ
In order to test this hypothesis, we now assume that f
is a linear function with a constant slope a, and with an
intercept (b1, b2) which varies with environmental con-
ditions from time 1 to time 2:
Y2 ¼
X
j¼1
aðnjt1Rj; EjÞ þ b2:
ð5Þ
Let E be, the mean of the effect trait weighted by
species abundance at times 1 and 2:
E1 ¼
X
j¼1
ðnjt1; EjÞ;
E2 ¼
X
j¼1
ðnjt1Rj; EjÞ:
Hence,
Y1 ¼ aE1 þ b1;
Y2 ¼ aE2 þ b2:
ð6Þ
According to Eqn (5), the change in ecosystem func-
tion will scale linearly with the change in mean effect
trait (E1; E2) from time 1 to time 2:
Y2  Y1 ¼ a E2  E1


þ b2  b1
ð
Þ:
ð7Þ
Whenever effect and response traits are related (see
Suding et al., 2008), E2 ¼ kE1, where k is a constant

reﬂecting the change in response trait between the two
time periods. Under these circumstances
Y2  Y1 ¼ k  1
ð
ÞaE1 þ b2  b1
ð
Þ:
ð8Þ
Using this reasoning, the change in C ﬂux with
environmental conditions can be broken down into a
direct effect of the environmental change (b2–b1) and an
indirect
effect
of
response-and-effect
trait
change

. However, effect and response traits may
completely overlap, we would then expect to see resi-
lience or dampened changes in ecosystem function
(Suding et al., 2008).
Data analysis
As the experiment started in spring 2003 and ﬁnished in
spring 2005, annual means of C ﬂuxes and plant traits
were calculated from the beginning of April to the end
of April of the next year. Repeated measure analysis of
variance (ANOVAs) and Fisher’s LSD post hoc tests were
performed to test effects of abiotic factors such as pre-
experimental (H vs. L, disturbance) and experimental
disturbance (H vs. L, disturbance level after the start of
the experiment) and date. Effects of individual and
combined factors on C ﬂuxes (i.e. abiotic variables,
functional diversity and community traits) were tested
by Spearman’s rank correlation and multiple regression
models with a step-wise ascending procedure (see Diaz
et al., 2007b). In the multiple regression model, ﬁnal
combination of traits and trait distribution (FD) were
retained according to F-value criteria. Community ag-
gregated traits and FD’s signiﬁcantly affecting C ﬂuxes,
were ﬁtted to Eqn (8) and slopes were compared using a
comparison of regression-line procedure. When neces-
sary, data were transformed by log or square root to
satisfy tests of normality. Statistical analyses were
performed with the
STATISTICA 6 package (StatSoft
Inc.,Tulsa, OK, USA).
Results
Plant community dynamics and C ﬂuxes
Effects of disturbance on plant community dynamics. Over 2
years of experiment, 41 plant species contributed to 99%
of the total vegetation cover. Grasses had the highest
(Po0.05) presence (%) in the transient HL treatment
(80%), followed by the HH, LH and LL treatments (70%,
61% and 44%, respectively, Table 1). Legumes had
signiﬁcantly
(Po0.05)
lower
contributions
in
monoliths of pre-experimental high disturbance (HL
and HH), compared with monoliths adapted to low
disturbance.
Applying frequent cuts to monoliths previously
adapted
to
low
disturbance
(LH)
resulted
in
a
replacement of dominant species including legumes
(Vicia cracca, Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Poa
pratensis,
Agrostis
capillaris)
compared
with
low
disturbance controls (LL) (data not shown). In contrast,
shifting
high
disturbance
controls
(HH)
to
low
disturbance
(HL),
changed
the
balance
between
codominant species (Festuca arundinacea and A. capillaris).
The Shannon diversity index (H0) and the plant
species
richness
(SNb)
were
higher
in
monoliths
extracted from low as opposed to high disturbance
ﬁeld plots (Po0.001, repeated measure ANOVA, data not
shown). A shift to low experimental disturbance (HL)
alleviated the decline (Po0.05, data not shown) in SNb
and H0, compared with high experimental disturbance
controls (HH). FD of SLA, LDMC and total aboveground
traits ranged from 0.23 to 0.58 (Table 1). A shift to high
disturbance markedly (Po0.05) increased FDSLA and
FDvg (i.e aboveground traits) of the HL-treatment.
Effects of disturbance and species number on C ﬂuxes. In
rank correlations, GPP correlates negatively (Po0.05)
with SNb, while a positive correlation is found for
SANPP (supporting information, Appendix S1). Step-
wise ascending regressions show a direct effect of plant
species number on top soil SOC (40.2 mm) (Table 2).
Trait based response-and-effect framework
Response to disturbance of community scale traits (R).
Community-aggregated
leaf
traits
and
root
and
rhizome traits are shown in Table 1. High compared
with low pre-experimental disturbance (HH vs. LL),
increased speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and speciﬁc length
of roots and rhizomes (SL), but reduced leaf dry-matter
content (LDMC) and the density (DENS) and dia-
meter (D) of roots and rhizomes. The N contents of
leaves (LNC) and of roots and rhizomes (NC) did not
differ signiﬁcantly between the HH and LL treatments.
Under transient disturbance regimes (HL and LH), a
reduced disturbance led to an increased dominance of
plant
species
with
high
leaf
dry-matter
content
(LDMC), low speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and low leaf N
content. Conversely, a shift from a low to a high
experimental
disturbance
(HL
vs.
HH)
reduced
LDMC and increased SLA, LNC and SL.
The experimental disturbance signiﬁcantly affected
leaf
traits
(SLA,
LDMC
and
LNC),
while
pre-
experimental disturbance signiﬁcantly affected root
and rhizome traits (SL, D and DENS). All traits
(except for LDMC) were affected by sampling date,
indicating the successive change of traits during the
experiment.

The fraction of rhizomes in the total belowground
phytomass was signiﬁcantly higher (Po0.001, ANOVA,
data not shown) at a pre-experimental low (LL, LH)
compared with high (HH, HL) disturbance level,
indicating
a
higher
presence
of
the
stoloniferous
grass Elytrigia repens in those treatments. Treatment
effects on the traits of ﬁne roots, coarse roots and
rhizomes
are
shown
in
supporting
information
(Appendix S2). The speciﬁc length of each of these
belowground plant parts was signiﬁcantly reduced at
a
low
compared
with
a
high
pre-experimental
disturbance, while the diameter of coarse roots and
rhizomes was increased.
Effects of community scale traits on C ﬂuxes (E). Rank
correlation coefﬁcients were used to analyse individual
effects on C ﬂuxes (supporting information, Appendix
S1). A step-wise ascending regression procedure was
applied to separate direct effects of disturbance (year)
from
indirect
effects
of
plant
species
diversity,
functional
divergence
and
community-aggregated
traits (Table 2).
Community scale leaf traits and C ﬂuxes. Total C
storage (NCS and SOC) and productivity (NEP, ANPP
and SANPP) were affected by three single leaf traits
(SLA, LNC and LDMC) and their distribution (FD)
(Appendix S1). However, the step-wise procedure did
not conﬁrm a direct effect of community-aggregated
leaf traits on C ﬂuxes. Apart for the signiﬁcant relation-
ship
between
ANPP
and
community-aggregated
LDMC, aboveground productivity and NCS were af-
fected by disturbance and functional divergence of SLA
and LDMC (see Table 2).
Community scale root and rhizome traits and C
ﬂuxes. Primary productivity (GPP, ANPP) and C sto-
rage (NCS, BNCS, SOC) were highly correlated to the
speciﬁc length (SL), diameter (D) and density (DENS) of
roots and rhizomes (Appendix S1). In step-wise proce-
dure, community-scale speciﬁc length, diameter and
density of roots and rhizomes had marked direct effects
on ANPP and belowground C ﬂuxes (NCS and BNCS)
(Table 2). The distribution of traits was tested by using
the functional divergence of shoot traits (FDvg). FDvg,
however, did not affect C ﬂuxes.
Mathematical test of the trait based response-and-effect
framework. In agreement with the framework proposed
by Suding et al. (2008), our experiment demonstrated
that
root and
rhizome
traits
(i.e.
SL,
D,
DENS)
responded to environmental change and signiﬁcantly
affected
C
ﬂuxes
(Table
2).
Using
Eqn
(6),
the
framework
was
tested
by
comparison
of
linear
regression between treatments. In each of the four
disturbance
treatments,
slopes
[a,
Eqn
(6)]
and
intercepts of the regressions between C ﬂuxes (Y) and
effect traits (E) were signiﬁcant (data not shown).
Because effect slopes (a) did not differ (P40.1, data
not shown) among treatments, equal slopes were
assumed and Eqn (8) was applied (Table 3).
The corresponding linear regressions show that
NCS, BNCS and SOC can be predicted (Po0.05),
according to Eqn (8), from roots and rhizome effect
traits (SL, DENS and diameter) (Table 3). Treatment
dependent intercepts for NCS and SOC indicate a
direct effect of disturbance on these C ﬂuxes (Table 3).
Interestingly, intercepts do not differ among treatments
for BNCS, showing that the change in C sequestration
was mostly mediated by root trait changes. Applying
the mathematical test to functional diversity of leaf
traits (FD) shows that total C storage (NCS) and
aboveground productivity (ANPP and SANPP) can be
predicted (Po0.05) according to Eqn (8) from FDSLA
and FDLDMC (Table 3). The positive slopes indicate that
aboveground
productivity
and
total
C-storage,
increases with functional divergence of leaf traits.
Signiﬁcant differences in intercepts among treatments
for NCS and SANPP underline that those C ﬂuxes are
also controlled by disturbance.
While important effect and response traits were
related (see Suding et al., 2008), changes in response
traits between the two time periods were calculated as
the constant k [see Eqn (8)] (Table 3). The measured
change in C ﬂux after a change in disturbance was
thereby broken into two components [see Eqn (8)]:
direct
and
indirect
effects
of
disturbance
and
response-and-effect
traits.
Accordingly,
community
traits (log SL, DENS, log D) contributed between 6%
and 61% to the change in C ﬂuxes after disturbance
shift (Table 3). These effects are displayed in Fig. 1,
showing direct disturbance effects as vertical arrows
and indirect response-and-effect as arrows parallel to
the slope [a, Eqn (8)]. Similarly, up to 48% of changes in
aboveground productivity (ANPP and SANPP) and
total C-storage (NCS) were explained by response-
and-effect changes of functional divergence of leaf
traits (SLA and LDMC).
Discussion
Insight on the role of plant community structure for
ecosystem functioning can best be gained in ecosystems
that allow easy manipulation, such as perennial grass-
land communities (Loreau & Hector, 2001). Focusing on
plant functional traits, rather than on species identities,
allows generalizing complex community dynamics and
predicting effects of ongoing environmental changes.
The framework proposed by Suding et al. (2008) de-
scribes an approach to scale up from individuals to

communities and ecosystems in the context of environ-
mental change predictions. Thereby, plants are classi-
ﬁed in terms of their response to environmental factors
and their effects on ecosystem properties (Chapin et al.,
2000; Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). Although this frame-
work deals with a highly relevant topic, empirical tests
are rare.
In a mesocosm experiment, we were able to continu-
ously measure C ﬂuxes during 2 years in grassland
communities affected by contrasted disturbance re-
gimes (Klumpp et al., 2007a, b). In a fully factorial
design, disturbance was either intensiﬁed or reduced.
We have shown that changes in aboveground produc-
tivity and belowground C storage after a change
in disturbance were neither directly related to plant
species richness, nor to legume abundance, but were
partly caused by response-and-effect traits and func-
tional diversity.

Response to disturbance of community scale traits (R)
The primary approach in identifying response traits is
to evaluate how environmental conditions alter trait
values. In our study, leaf and root (and rhizome) traits
showed a common response to disturbance. In both
steady-state (LL, HH) and transient disturbance re-
gimes (HL and LH), a reduced disturbance led to plant
growth strategies of resources conservation (i.e. high
tissue density, low N content and low area per unit leaf
mass) (e.g. Reich et al., 1995; Wright & Westoby, 1999).
Inversely, a growth strategy inducing resource exploita-
tion (low tissue density, high N content and high area
per unit mass leaves) was favoured by high disturbance
(Louault et al., 2005).
Roots and rhizome traits were also response traits to
the disturbance regime. In contrast to leaf traits, root
and rhizome traits were mostly controlled by the pre-
experimental disturbance level (see supporting infor-
mation, Appendix S2), indicating carry-over effects
caused by the extended life span of roots compared
with leaves. A shift to high disturbance led to marked
changes in root (and rhizome) morphology (increased
speciﬁc length, reduced diameter and tissue density),
presumably increasing root elongation (Eissenstat, 1992;
Eissenstat et al., 2000) and soil nutrient acquisition
(Craine et al., 2002) rates. As with leaf traits, these
morphological changes correspond to an increased
dominance of exploitative plant growth strategies
(Roumet et al., 2006). Conversely, a shift from high to
low disturbance, led to small but nevertheless consis-
tent changes (reduced SL, increased D and DENS) in the
morphology of belowground plant parts. As with leaf
traits, these changes indicate an increased dominance of
conservative plant growth strategies (Roumet et al.,
2006).
Relating effects of community scale traits to C ﬂuxes (E)
Functional effect traits are deﬁned as those traits that
have an impact on ecosystem functioning (Diaz &
Fig. 1
Direct and response-and-effect components of carbon (C) ﬂux changes [see Eqn (8)] after a change in disturbance. Direct effects
are shown as vertical arrows. Response-and-effect changes mediated by tissue density of roots and rhizomes (DENS) (d) and functional
divergence of speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) (a–c) are shown as arrows parallel to the slope (a) of the effect
trait (dotted lines). Estimated C ﬂuxes are for constant low disturbance (black circles), constant high disturbance (black triangles), shift to

Cabido, 2001; Lavorel & Garnier, 2002). In agreement
with the response-and-effect framework (Suding et al.,
2008), our community traits were classiﬁed in terms of
their response to environmental factors (response traits)
and their effects on ecosystem services (C ﬂuxes) (effect
traits). As abiotic factors (i.e. disturbance, year) may
explain a signiﬁcant amount of variation, we applied a
step-wise ascending regression procedure to separate
abiotic effects from effects mediated by plant species
number, functional divergence and (effect) traits. By
including functional divergence effects, our procedure
allowed a formal incorporation of functional diversity
as a driving factor in the sensitivity to disturbance
change.
In our experiment, the rank correlation between
aboveground productivity (SANPP) and community
leaf traits (SLA and LDMC) supported the mass ratio
hypothesis in agreement with the report by Garnier
et al. (2004). However, in a step-wise regression proce-
dure the functional divergence (FDSLA), rather than
the mean value of these traits, explained aboveground
net
primary
productivity
(ANPP
and
SANPP).
The mass ratio hypothesis has been theoretically linked
to a selection mechanism (i.e. selection of dominant
species), whereas the functional divergence underlines
a reduced overlap of trait values in a community
(Mason et al., 2005). Effects of functional trait distribu-
tions, can thus be related to a niche complementarity
effect (Petchey & Gaston, 2006), suggesting functional
diversity as the driving factor of productivity (Diaz
et al., 2007b).
ANPP and total belowground C storage (NCS, BNCS,
SOC) were highly correlated to the speciﬁc length (SL),
diameter (D) and density (DENS) of roots and rhi-
zomes. Irrespective of current disturbance regime and
of year, the step-wise ascending procedure conﬁrms a
direct role of mean root and rhizome trait values
on both above- and belowground C ﬂuxes. However,
this effect is most consistent with BNCS, which is
signiﬁcantly affected by SL, D and DENS. High
tissue density and low speciﬁc length of roots has been
shown to reduce the decomposition rate of below-
ground litter (Personeni & Loiseau, 2005), which in turn
explains the increase in mean residence time of C in
coarse particulate soil organic matter (Klumpp et al.,
2007b)
and,
hence,
belowground
C
sequestration
(BNCS). Root and rhizome traits would therefore pri-
marily control soil processes such as belowground
C sequestration, but would also have an indirect effect
on other C ﬂuxes through N-cycling (Bardgett et al.,
2005; De Deyn et al., 2008). In contrast our ﬁndings
show, the functional diversity of leaf traits would have a
direct effect on ANPP, but no signiﬁcant effect on other
C ﬂuxes.
Mathematical test of response-and-effect hypothesis. Can we
incorporate
functional
traits
and
diversity
to
successfully predict effects of environmental change in
a conceptual way? The work presented here, provides a
mathematical test of the response and effect framework
by Suding et al. (2008). Our approach was tested by (i)
assuming (for simpliﬁcation) a linear effect of the
response-and-effect traits on C ﬂuxes [see Eqns (4–8)],
allowing us to quantitatively determine the role of
disturbance and (ii) by integrating other mechanisms
apart from the mass ratio hypothesis (i.e. FD).
Highly signiﬁcant regressions were found with root
and rhizome traits and functional divergence of SLA
and
LDMC.
Noticeably,
the
response-and-effect
changes in C ﬂux account for between 3% and 48%
of the total C ﬂux changes (ANPP and NCS), indicating
that some ﬂuxes are more susceptible to changes in trait
values and their distribution than others (SANPP).
Interestingly, the positive slope of the response of
ANPP, SANPP and NCS to functional divergence of
SLA and LDMC indicates that the distribution of trait
values conditions aboveground NPP. This demonstrates
that the prediction of ecosystem services requires data
on functional diversity factors, which is in agreement
with
results of Diaz et
al. (2007b). Nevertheless,
differences between intercepts among treatments for
NCS and SANPP highlight the fact that C ﬂuxes are
also controlled by disturbance. Moreover, our study
shows that FD does not always explain changes in C
ﬂuxes (i.e. rejection of FDvg for BNCS) and the
community trait values can be sufﬁcient for practical
reasons. However, we did not measure the functional
diversity of root traits, which might yield better
prediction of belowground C ﬂuxes (BNCS) than
community trait values. To overcome this limitation,
new
methods
allowing
the
determination
of
belowground species traits are required.
As with ANPP, transient effects of disturbance are
asymmetric for soil C sequestration (NCS, BNCS and
SOC) because increasing disturbance (LH vs. LL) has
stronger
effects
(response
factor
k)
than
reducing
disturbance (HL vs. HH). The asymmetry results from a
stronger response of community traits to an increase as
opposed to a decline in disturbance. For example, with
regard to SL, k increased by 140% in response to
disturbance increase, whereas it was reduced by 6% in
response to disturbance decline. Our data conﬁrms that
organic C is lost more rapidly from soil than it is gained
(Ko¨rner, 2003; Soussana et al., 2004). Nevertheless, we
found a common effect slope (a) for both increase and
decline in disturbance, suggesting that asymmetry is
mostly mediated by trait responses and not by trait effects.
Because the disturbance induced trade-off between C
sequestration, and herbage production (Klumpp et al.,
P L A N T T R A I T S A N D C S E Q U E S T R AT I O N I N G R A S S L A N D S

2007a) is mediated by community-scale response-and-
effect traits and functional diversity, plant diversity is
presumably a major driver of C cycle responses to
disturbance in grasslands. In contrast to species-rich
grasslands, sown grass mixtures are likely to have a
small functional divergence of traits following changes
in
disturbance
change,
which
may
limit
their
C
sequestration potential.
In
conclusion,
we
were
able
to
show
how
environmental changes affect community traits and
their distribution and how they relate to C ﬂuxes in
grasslands. Moreover, we identiﬁed a set of community
scale traits that predict changes in C sequestration in
species-rich grasslands. In contrast, for herbage pro-
duction, functional diversity of leaf traits has been
shown to be the best predictior. Applying a set of
statistical procedures reduced uncertainties in predict-
ing ecosystem processes, allowing, for the ﬁrst time: (i) to
test mathematically the response-and-effect approach, (ii) to
scale up from individuals to communities and eco-
systems in the context of environmental change (iii) to
test hypothesis other than the mass ratio and to (iv) to
determine quantitative effects of disturbances, commu-
nity traits and functional diversity on C ﬂuxes. Further
tests will be required with other environmental factors
(e.g. elevated CO2, warming, etc.) in order to predict
future changes in ecosystem services under global
change.

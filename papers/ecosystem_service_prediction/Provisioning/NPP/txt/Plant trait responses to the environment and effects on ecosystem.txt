Abstract
A combined analysis of plant trait responses to the environment, and their effects on ecosystem properties has recently been
proposed. In this study, we related the trait composition of plant communities to soil nutrients and disturbance as environmental
drivers and to productivity, decomposition and soil carbon as ecosystem properties. We surveyed two sites, one comprising
intensivelygrazedandfertilizedgrasslands,theotherconsistingofsemi-naturalgrasslandandopenheathland.Speciesabundance
and trait values of 49 species were recorded in 69 plots, as well as parameters describing soil resources, land-use disturbances,
and ecosystem properties. Our main goal was to test whether the average or the diversity of the trait values of the vegetation had
stronger effects on ecosystem properties (mass ratio vs. diversity hypothesis). Structural equation modeling was used to perform
a simultaneous analysis of trait responses and effects. Speciﬁc leaf area and leaf nutrient contents were always negatively
correlated with stem dry matter content and canopy height, indicating greater investments in supportive and nutrient-conserving
tissue as plants increased in size. In the agricultural site, disturbance was the single most important factor decreasing plant height,
while leaf traits such as speciﬁc leaf area and leaf nutrient contents increased with soil resources in heathlands. Productivity
was directly or indirectly driven by leaf traits, and investments in structural tissue increased standing biomass and soil carbon.
Different environmental drivers in the two sites produced opposing leaf trait effects on litter decomposition. Ecosystem properties
were explained by the community mean trait value as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Evidence for effects of functional
diversity on productivity and other ecosystem properties was not detected, suggesting that diversity–productivity relationships
depend on the length of the investigated environmental gradients. We conclude that changes in community composition and
dominance hierarchies deserve the most attention when ecosystem properties must be maintained.
Zusammenfassung
Eine kombinierte Analyse der Reaktion von Pﬂanzenmerkmalen (traits) auf die Umwelt und ihrer Auswirkungen auf Ökosys-
temfunktionen wurde kürzlich vorgeschlagen (‘response-effect framework’). In der vorliegenden Studie wenden wir diese
Analyse auf zwei landwirtschaftliche Gebiete, welche sich in der Nutzungsintensität unterscheiden, und folgende Ökosys-
temprozesse an: oberirdische Biomasse, speziﬁsche Nettoprimärproduktion (SANPP), Streuzersetzung und Bodenkohlenstoff.
Dafür wurden die Frequenz und die trait-Werte von 49 Arten in insgesamt 69 Plots aufgenommen. Darüber hinaus wurden
Parameter erhoben, welche Bodenwasser und -nährstoffe, Landnutzung und Ökosystemeigenschaften beschreiben. Wir haben
zudem getestet, ob der durchschnittliche trait-Wert oder die Diversität der trait-Werte aller Arten einer Gemeinschaft größere
Effekte auf Ökosystemprozesse zeigt (‘mass ratio’ versus ‘diversity’ Hypothese). Strukturgleichungsmodelle wurden verwendet,
um eine simultane Analyse des ‘response-effect framework’ zu untersuchen. Der Gesamtdatensatz wurde in zwei Gruppen

auf einen eher konservierenden Umgang mit Ressourcen hindeutet. Auf den landwirtschaftlich geprägten Plots war Störung der
wichtigste Umweltfaktor der zu einer Abnahme der Wuchshöhe führte, während die Bodenressourcen die Blatteigenschaften,
z.B. speziﬁsche Blattﬂäche und Blattnährstoffgehalte in den Heidegebieten geprägt haben. Die Biomasseproduktivität war direkt
oder indirekt angetrieben von den Blattmerkmalen, wobei verstärkte Investitionen in die Pﬂanzenstruktur zu einer Erhöhung
der stehenden Biomasse und Bodenkohlenstoffgehalte führten. Die unterschiedlichen Landnutzungen hatten gegensätzliche
Effekte der Blatteigenschaften auf die Streuzersetzung zur Folge. Die gemittelten trait-Werte aller Arten einer Gemeinschaft

Introduction
Currentresearchinplantfunctionaltraitsusestwodifferent
approaches providing valuable insights into the mechanisms
of ecosystem function. First, extensive study on trait response
to environmental drivers and biotic interactions has been
reported (e.g. Garnier et al. 2004). Second, investigations
addressed how ecosystem properties including primary pro-
ductivity and litter decomposition depend on functional traits
(e.g. Kremen & Ostfeld 2005). The response–effect frame-
work (Lavorel & Garnier 2002; Suding et al. 2008) offers
a combined analysis of trait responses to the environment
and the subsequent effects on ecosystem properties, but the
methodology has rarely been applied in natural landscapes
(Pakeman 2004). This remains a notable disparity (Lavorel
et al. 2011). In the present study, we perform a simultaneous
analysis of trait responses and effects in an agricultural region
characterized by land-use intensiﬁcation.
In agricultural landscapes, ecosystem processes and prop-
erties such as primary productivity, standing biomass, and
litter decomposition translate directly into ecosystem ser-
vices, including forage and crop yields, and associated
nutrient balance (Díaz et al. 2007a; Lavorel et al. 2011).
Therefore, quantiﬁed relationships between environmental
conditions, plant traits, and ecosystem properties are partic-
ularly relevant for agricultural landscape management. One
central aim was to study these response–effect relationships,
particularly for aboveground biomass (AGB), speciﬁc above
ground net primary productivity (SANPP), litter decom-
position (LITTER), and total soil carbon (CARBON) of
grasslands and heathlands, managed for agriculture and
conservation, respectively. Farmers manipulate these ecosys-
tem properties by selecting soils with appropriate water
resources, by changing the nutrient status of the soil, and
by applying disturbances such as tilling, mowing or graz-
ing. Therefore soil nutrients, soil water holding capacity and
disturbance intensity are considered relevant environmental
drivers affecting ecosystem properties in agricultural land-
scapes. These effects can be direct, for example increasing
tillage and fertilization improve decomposition of organic
carbon by enhancing microbial activity (DeGryze et al.
2004). The response–effect framework, however, assumes
that most links between the abiotic environment and carbon-
related ecosystem properties are indirect and operate through
changes in the trait composition of plant communities, which
in turn depend on gains and losses of species, i.e. changes
in biodiversity. Traits related to plant growth and carbon
gain are likely candidates to simultaneously respond to
environmental drivers and affect ecosystem properties of
the carbon cycle. For instance, speciﬁc leaf area (SLA)
is associated with net assimilation and plant growth rates
(Reich, Walters, & Ellsworth 1997) while leaf dry matter
content (LDMC) is tied to plant nutrient retention (Poorter
& Garnier 1999). Leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf
phosphorus content (LPC) are correlated with protein con-
centrations involved in photosynthesis (Evans 1989) as well
as leaf growth and defense strategies (Reich et al. 2008).
Global (Wright et al. 2004) and local (Lienin & Kleyer
2011) datasets reported these leaf traits as highly corre-
lated, indicating a ‘leaf economics spectrum’ that runs
from resource conservation to rapid resource acquisition and
turnover in leaves. Freschet, Cornelissen, Logtestijn, and
Aerts (2010) proposed that the ‘leaf economics spectrum’
can be expanded to a whole plant economics spectrum as
stem and root dry matter show a strongly coordinated pat-
tern with leaf traits. Another trait associated with growth and
carbon gain is plant height. It is a major determinant for
a plant’s ability to compete for light but requires increas-
ing investments in structural tissues, such as stems and
branches (Westoby, Falster, Moles, Vesk, & Wright 2002;
Moles et al. 2009), which should decrease plant growth
rates.
Here, we hypothesize that ecosystem processes such as
biomass, litter and soil C accumulation are associated with

resource conservation and height attaining strategies in plants
as well as with low soil resources and disturbance inten-
sities (Lavorel & Grigulis 2012). On the other hand, high
soil resources and increasing land use intensity should favor
rapid resource acquisition by plant leaves and lower plant
height, which in turn increases carbon turnover in terms
of annual productivity and decomposition, whereas effects
on standing biomass and soil carbons stocks should be
negative.
Evidence from experiments indicates that plant species
richness has positive effects on multiple ecosystem prop-
erties (e.g. Isbell et al. 2011). Consequently, we ask if
multiple ecosystem properties and multiple environmental
factors are linked via recurring key traits, or if each ecosys-
tem property is affected by different traits (Hooper et al.
2005).
However, the diversity of traits responding to environ-
mental drivers and affecting ecosystem properties is only
one facet of functional diversity. Another aspect refers to
trait value diversity within communities, and two hypothe-
ses were generated. The mass ratio hypothesis states that
the functional traits of the most abundant species in a com-
munity determine ecosystem properties (Grime 1998). To
address this hypothesis, the trait values of all species in
a community are averaged, then weighted by species rela-
tive abundance (termed CWM: community weighted mean;
Díaz et al. 2007b). According to the ‘diversity hypothesis’,
organismal diversity in a community, and species’ func-
tional traits should inﬂuence ecosystem properties through
complementary resource use, among other factors (Tilman
et al. 1997). Increased functional diversity (FD) should lead
to heightened niche packing along a resource use axis,
therefore a highly diverse community will have more sub-
stantial effects on biogeochemical pools and ﬂuxes (Hooper
1998). Empirical evidence has been reported for both the-
ories (e.g. Vile, Shipley, & Garnier 2006). Mokany, Ash,
and Roxburgh (2008) for instance demonstrated that func-
tional traits of dominant species had the greatest effect on
ecosystemproperties.Díazetal.(2007b)includedabioticfac-
tors, aggregated trait values, and FD in a single analysis and
described differential effects on standing biomass, productiv-
ity, and litter decomposition. The fact that both hypotheses
are normally tested separately does not mean that they are
mutually exclusive. Rather, community weighted means and
functional diversity of traits may exhibit an additive inﬂuence
in response–effect frameworks.
To specify these hypotheses in greater detail, we ﬁrst
devised an initial model based on published knowledge. We
then used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the
initial model. SEM can be considered as a method that seeks
to create a connection between empirical data and theoretical
ideas (Grace, Anderson, Olff, & Scheiner 2010). We per-
formed our survey in two sites, one consisted of intensively
grazed and fertilized grasslands classiﬁed as ‘agriculture’,
while ‘heath’ was comprised extensively grazed and unfer-
tilized semi-natural grassland and open heathlands.
Materials and methods
Study sites
Two ﬁeld sites were located in Northwest Germany,
approximately 25 km apart from each other (52◦55′N,
8◦15′E; 52◦55′N, 7◦56′E) (Appendix A). The climate is char-
acterized as oceanic, with dominant westerly winds. Mean
annual rainfall is 740 mm, and mean annual temperature is
8.7 ◦C. Elevation ranges from 19 m to 44 m a.s.l. Soils are
primarily sandy on moraine sediments.
We applied a random stratiﬁed design to select 69 non-
contiguous plots (4.5 m × 4.5 m) across both sites. Sampling
was conducted in 2007 and 2008. The plots selected were
stratiﬁed by broad categories of land-use intensity and soil
moisture. The ‘agriculture’ site ranged from intensively and
extensively used grassland to fallow land (29 plots) and
the ‘heath’ site from semi-natural grasslands (dry soils) to
shrub/heathlands (well-drained and dry soils; 40 plots).
A common feature of both sites was the “Plaggen’ cultiva-
tion, a historic land use practiced from the Middle Ages to the
18th century. In this land use system, the top soil including
the litter layer was removed from forests, used as bedding
for cattle, and after being enriched with slurry, spread on
arable ﬁelds for fertilization. As an outcome of these land
use practices, forests almost vanished, and open heaths and
even denuded soils became predominant. This land use sys-
tem was abandoned with the availability of mineral fertilizer.
Today, remaining heathlands are extensively managed and
conﬁned to small areas (Behre 2008) whereas the majority
was converted to fertilized pastures and ﬁelds.
Environmental parameters
In each plot, soil samples were obtained from each soil
horizon (typically three or less) down to a depth of 60 cm
using a 100-cm3 soil sample ring, air-dried, and sieved using
a 2 mm sieve. Field and lab measured variables included
bulk density, soil solution pH, soil texture, soil density
(Schlichting, Blume, & Stahr 1995), available soil potassium
(K), and phosphorus (P) per unit mass (Table 1). K und P were
extracted with ammonia-lactate solution. K was measured
with a ﬂame photometer, P with a Continuous Flow Ana-
lyzer (Murphy & Riley 1962; Skalar Analytic, Netherlands).
Soil texture and organic carbon content were used to esti-
matesoilwaterholdingcapacity(WHC)followingAGBoden
(2005).
Plots were ranked on a disturbance gradient using an index
which was calculated as the product of the percentage of
biomass removal per disturbance event (F) with the dis-
turbance return interval per year (I), summarized over all
disturbances (i) that represent the land management of a plot
(e.g. cutting, grazing, ploughing):

In areas grazed by cattle or sheep, plots were fenced to
exclude grazing. Biomass removal by grazing was quantiﬁed
by harvesting 1-m2 inside and outside the exclosure. Harvest
differences were expressed as percentage of aboveground
biomass removal.
Species selection and trait measurements
Frequencies of plant species at each plot were recorded
with a 1 m × 1 m frame. Nomenclature followed Jäger and
Werner (2002). Traits of the most abundant species (total of
49 species) were measured for ten individuals of each species
as follows (Table 1): speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter
content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phospho-
rus content (LPC), leaf C/N ratio (LC/N), stem dry matter
content (SDMC), and canopy height of an individual plant
(HEIGHT). Trait measurements and chemical analyses from
all samples obtained in the laboratory followed standard pro-
tocols (Knevel, Bekker, Kunzmann, Stadler, & Thompson
2005).
Ecosystem properties
Total aboveground standing biomass (AGB) was harvested
in March and August (minimum and maximum yearly values,
respectively) on 0.5-m2 per plot for each date. Speciﬁc above-
ground net primary productivity (SANPP) was calculated as
follows:
SANPP
= loge(live biomass in August) −loge(live biomass in March)
tAugust −tMarch
where tAugust and tMarch are the harvest dates, and loge
expresses the natural logarithm to the base e
SANPP expresses primary productivity on a per gram of
green biomass basis instead of a ground area basis (Garnier
et al. 2004), and describes the net increase in a community
aboveground biomass per unit time (here: per month).
Litter mass loss (or decomposition rate) was determined in
a litterbag experiment. Fresh plant material was collected in
autumn 2007, and left to decompose for 12 months in the ﬁeld
on the soil surface in 1 mm mesh litterbags (four replicates
per plot, 2 g litter each). The recovered material was cleaned,
oven dried, and weighed. The rate of litter mass loss was
calculated relative to its initial mass. In addition, total soil
carbon was measured for the upper 60 cm of soil.
Statistical analysis
For each plot, community weighted means of each trait
were calculated by weighing the trait value of a species
by its frequency, and averaging the weighted trait values
across all species of a community selected for trait mea-
surements. As a functional diversity index, we calculated the
functional dispersion (FDis) of all traits. FDis is the mean dis-
tance in multidimensional trait space of individual species to
the centroid of all species in the community. FDis accounts
for species abundance, and is by construction unaffected by
species richness. For more details see Laliberté and Legendre
(2010).
Leaf traits (SLA, LDMC, LNC, LPC, LC/N) and soil
parameters (Soil P, Soil K and pH) were converted into aggre-
gate variables (‘LEAFTRAITS’ and ‘NUTRIENTS’, respec-
tively) via principal component analyses (PCA). The ﬁrst
principal component score was generated as a new/aggregate
value. The ﬁrst PCA component for leaf traits accounted for
55.13% (‘agriculture’) and 72.25% (‘heath’) of the variance
in the ﬁve trait variables. The ﬁrst PCA component for soil
variables accounted for 61.03% (‘agriculture’) and 66.92%
(‘heath’) of the variance in the three soil parameters. LEAF-
TRAITS summarized the leaf economics spectrum, which
ranged from leaves exhibiting acquisition properties with
high SLA, LNC, and LPC and low LDMC and LC/N val-
ues to conservative leaves with low SLA, LNC, and LPC and
high LDMC and LC/N values (Wright et al. 2004). LEAF
TRAITS increased with SLA and decreased with LDMC.
We applied path modeling to quantify the response–effect
framework. Path modeling can be considered a special
approach to structural equation modeling (SEM; Grace
2006), where only single indicators are applied to each of
the variables. SEM results are dependent on the correct
speciﬁcations of theoretical underlying relationships among
variables prior to analysis (Shipley 2000). SEM can be used
in a conﬁrmatory or exploratory mode. If used in a con-
ﬁrmatory mode, the theoretical model is tested to examine
if the model adequately ﬁts the data. In this study, we used
an exploratory mode where an initial theoretical model was
separately applied to the ‘agriculture’ and ‘heath’ datasets.
The initial response–effect model
The initial path-model (Fig. 1, variables explained in
Table 1) speciﬁes the hypothesized relationships between
environmental variables (NUTRIENTS, DISTURBANCE,
and WHC) inﬂuencing traits (SDMC, HEIGHT, LEAF-
TRAITS, and FDis), which determined ecosystem properties
(AGB, SANPP, LITTER and CARBON). The environmen-
tal variables were considered exogenous variables with no
incoming arrows and all other variables were endogenous
variables, assumed to depend on the exogenous variables.
We assumed a positive relationship between disturb-
ance regimes (DISTURBANCE) and nutrient availability
(NUTRIENTS). Fertilizer application is more pervasive in
intensively used sites, such as agricultural landscapes. Soil
water holding capacity (WHC) should exhibit a negative cor-
relation with DISTURBANCE and NUTRIENTS, because
we expect that land use concentrates on soils with lower

WHC, avoiding stagnant soils under the humid conditions
of Northwest Germany. The model core comprised of plant
traits that respond to soil resources and disturbances, and
affect components of the carbon and/or nitrogen cycles. Stem
dry matter content (SDMC) is often correlated with LDMC
(Freschet et al. 2010), therefore the relationship between
LEAFTRAITS and SDMC should be negative.

and

height
(HEIGHT) entered the model as community weighted
means. As a measure of FD, we chose the functional
dispersion of these traits (FDis, Laliberté & Legendre 2010).
We expected that increasing NUTRIENTS, WHC, and
DISTURBANCE would favor plants with acquisitive leaf
traits, i.e. high LEAFTRAITS values. DISTURBANCE
should negatively affect HEIGHT and SDMC, because
frequent biomass removal favors non-woody plants of
relatively small stature (Garnier et al. 2004; Lienin &
Kleyer 2011). Frequent biomass removal represents a strong
environmental ﬁlter, therefore we assumed that increasing
DISTURBANCE reduces the diversity of viable plant
strategies in a community, and consequently negatively
affects FDis. Alternatively, higher WHC should result in a
broader range of viable functional strategies, due to fewer
restrictions on water use (‘physiological tolerance’, Currie
et al. 2004).
Our second set of initial paths focused on how plant com-
munities affect the ecosystem through speciﬁc traits. An
increase in SANPP was expected with LEAFTRAITS due
to the correlation of SLA with relative growth rate, whereas
plant height should have an opposite effect on SANPP, due to
additional investments in structural tissue. FDis was expected
to affect SANPP positively via niche complementary (Díaz
et al. 2007a). LITTER and CARBON are mainly controlled
by leaf characteristics. For example, species with low LDMC
and high leaf nutrient values produce rapidly decompos-
ing litter (Kazakou, Vile, Shipley, Gallet, & Garnier 2006).
Therefore, LEAFTRAITS should increase LITTER, and be
negatively correlated to CARBON, however SDMC should
increase CARBON and AGB, while decreasing litter decom-
position (De Deyn, Cornelissen, & Bardgett 2008; Freschet
et al. 2010).
Based on modiﬁcation indices and residuals, the initial
model was altered by removing or adding paths to improve
the ﬁt between the model and the data from each site. This
was achieved by maintaining the overall initial relationships
(as described above). This approach allowed assessment
and identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc paths contingent on man-
agement. The best-ﬁt model was selected by aiming to
achieve the following: (i) a non-signiﬁcant χ2 value with
an associated high P-value; (ii) a root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) with values <0.05; and (iii) a Com-
parative Fit Index (CFI) with values >0.90 (Byrne 2010).
The χ2 test of model ﬁt determined whether the ﬁt between
model and data was adequate and is recommended since a
non-signiﬁcant result is a strong indication of an adequate
ﬁt between model and data. RMSEA and CFI, which take
sample size into account, are recognized as one of the most
helpful criteria in structure modeling (Grace 2006).
Additional model interpretation was facilitated by ‘direct
effects’ and ‘total effects’, which are the sum of direct and
indirect pathways from the predictors. Statistical analyses
were conducted using the computer software R to calculate

The pastures, meadows and ﬁeld margins of the ‘agri-
culture’ site had on average higher soil phosphorus, water
holding capacity, pH, and disturbance intensity values than
the ‘heath’ site (Table 1). Soil potassium was the only vari-
able that exhibited a higher value in ‘heath’. Correspondingly,
‘agriculture’ plant communities showed increased canopy
height, SLA, LNC, LPC, and decreased SDMC and LDMC
values relative to ‘heath’. However, AGB, SANPP, rate of lit-
ter mass loss, and soil carbon were not signiﬁcantly different
between both sites.
SEM modiﬁcations
The initial model (Fig. 1) did not produce an adequate ﬁt
for the ‘agriculture’ data. Results suggested the deletion of

several non-signiﬁcant paths (WHC →LEAFTRAITS and
FDis,
NUTRIENTS →LEAFTRAITS,
DIST →FDis,
SDMC →LITTER
and
CARBON,
LEAF-
TRAITS →SANPP and FDis →SANPP). Adding paths
from WHC to CARBON, HEIGHT to LEAFTRAITS,
LEAFTRAITS to FDis, and FDis to CARBON improved
model ﬁt. The resulting ‘agriculture’ model exhibited
good consistency with the data (P = 0.46, RMSEA = 0.02,
CFI = 0.99; see Fig. 2 for standardized direct effects), and
explained 23% of the variation in AGB, 14% of the variation
in SANPP, 38% of the variation in LITTER, and 63% of the
variation in CARBON.
The initial ‘heath’ model did not produce adequate
ﬁt.
Similarly,
we
removed
non-signiﬁcant
pathways
from
the
model
(DISTURBANCE →SDMC
and
FDIS,
WHC →LEAFTRAITS,
SDMC →LITTER,
FDIS →SANPP and HEIGHT →SANPP). Modiﬁcation
indices suggested the addition of two direct paths from
NUTRIENTS to CARBON and WHC to CARBON. The
resulting stable model was consistent with the data (P = 0.19,
RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.98; see Fig. 2 for standardized direct
effects), and explained 44% of the variation in AGB, 39%
of the variation in SANPP, 73% of the variation in LITTER,
and 52% of the variation in CARBON.
Our description of the ﬁnal models will be primar-
ily restricted to direct effects, but considers standardized
total effects where necessary for model interpretation
(Appendix A).
Environment–trait–ecosystem property
relationships
Trait–trait relationships were largely consistent with the
initial model. In both sites, increasing values of leaf traits, i.e.
higher SLA and lower LDMC, covaried with lower SDMC.
Increased canopy height required an increase in SDMC,
and concomitantly lower SLA and LNC, and higher LDMC
(∼lower leaf trait values). In our initial model, a correlation
between FDis and traits calculated as community-weighted
means was not detected. However, in the ‘agriculture’
model, FDis increased with positive leaf trait values and
decreased with plant height (total effect), indicating that
grassland communities consist, on average of small, fast-
growing acquisitive species with higher variation in trait
values. The ‘agriculture’ plant community traits were pri-
marily controlled by disturbance intensity; however, soil
nutrients affected the ‘heath’ communities. FDis was con-
trolled by water holding capacity only in heathlands. Most
paths from traits to ecosystem properties in the ‘heath’ com-
munities were consistent with the initial model, e.g. leaf
traits positively affected SANPP and litter decomposition
rates. A limited number of relationships between traits and
ecosystem properties conformed to the initial model for the
‘agriculture’ communities, for either the path or path direc-
tion. For example, leaf traits were not related to SANPP,
although we assumed high SLA, LNC, LPC, and low LDMC
would increase SANPP. Furthermore, litter decomposition
rates decreased instead of increased with higher leaf trait val-
ues, and showed a positive relationship with canopy height
(total effect). The only paths consistent with the initial
model and ‘heath’ data were a negative leaf trait relation-
ship with soil carbon, a positive SDMC relationship with
AGB, and a negative canopy height relationship with SANPP.
Results of the initial model indicated FDis should posi-
tively affect SANPP, which was not supported by the ﬁnal
models.
Both models included indirect links between environmen-
tal variables and ecosystem properties. The ‘agriculture’
model detected a positive correlation between soil carbon and
water holding capacity. In the ‘heath’ model, soil nutrients
and water holding capacity directly affected soil carbon.
Discussion
This study provided further evidence that plant-related
ecosystem properties are inﬂuenced by plant traits (e.g.
Chapin et al. 2000). Furthermore, traits depend on envi-
ronmental conditions, which add a functional element to
the long-standing biodiversity–ecosystem functioning debate
(Tilman et al. 1997; Naeem et al. 2000; Wardle et al. 2000).
Results also indicated direct environment–ecosystem links,
but according to the number and strength of signiﬁcant paths,
environment–trait–ecosystem controls were more cohesive.
Trait–trait correlations within plants remained consistent
across both sites, conﬁrming our initial model. A negative
relationship between the leaf economics spectrum (Wright
et al. 2004) and SDMC and canopy height was detected, indi-
cating increased investments in supportive and conservative
tissue as plants grew and matured (Freschet et al. 2010; Lienin
& Kleyer 2011).
Responses of this general functional pattern to the environ-
ment and its effect on ecosystem properties were markedly
shapedbyland-useintensity.Inourinitialmodel,weassumed
that soil nutrients and disturbance intensity should cumula-
tively inﬂuence leaf traits, and that canopy height and SDMC
should respond to disturbance intensity, that is, more frequent
disturbances lead to smaller plants (Tilman 1988; Kühner &
Kleyer 2008). However, in the agricultural site the main envi-
ronmental gradient affecting trait responses was disturbance,
and the nutrient gradient had no inﬂuence, probably because
all plots had been fertilized. In contrast to that, the nutrient
and water holding capacity gradient determined to a consider-
able extent trait responses in the unfertilized heathland, which
was managed with overall light sheep grazing. In the ‘heath’
model,SDMCandleaftraitswerehighlycorrelated,andwere
key traits that inﬂuenced all ecosystem properties. In contrast
to this result, the ‘agriculture’ model showed the absence
of any obvious key trait. Instead, each trait affected another
ecosystem property (with the exception of functional disper-
sion). Consequently, this study revealed context-dependent

309
results regarding whether a few key traits or diverse traits
inﬂuenced ecosystem properties.
Nutrient-driven relationships in the ‘heath’
model
As expected, and described for the initial model, leaf
traits inﬂuenced the rate of productivity (SANPP), litter
decomposition, and soil carbon in the ‘heath’ model. These
relationships were identiﬁed in an overall nutrient-poor envi-
ronment (Table 1), where relatively little variation in soil
nutrients was responsible for trait responses and effects.
Aboveground biomass was negatively correlated with leaf
traits (indirect effects, Appendix A), and positively corre-
lated with SDMC, indicating biomass accumulation in dry,
nutrient-poor sites inhabited by plants exhibiting a resource-
conservation strategy, according to the high leaf C/N ratios
and dry matter content (e.g. Pakeman, Leps, Kleyer, Lavorel,
& Garnier 2009). Litter decomposition in heathlands occurs
gradually, resulting in slow soil carbon cycling and increased
soil organic carbon (Aerts & Chapin 2000; Tjoelker, Craine,
Wedin, Reich, & Tilman 2005).
Disturbance-driven relationships in the
‘agriculture’ model
Some trait–ecosystem paths in the ‘agriculture’ model
were not consistent with the initial model. Disturbance inten-
sity increased with soil nutrient availability and decreased
with water holding capacity, i.e. farming and fertilization
were concentrated on drier sites, and moister sites were less
intensely farmed or abandoned. These correlations added
indirect effects to the model. For example, almost no direct
effect by disturbance on leaf traits was observed, however,
a correlation with soil nutrient availability yielded a posi-
tive indirect effect, as SLA increased with high soil nutrients
(Freschet et al. 2010). That said, a concurrent decrease of
LDMC and SDMC with increasing disturbance intensity was
observed.
Cumulatively, disturbance and increasing soil nutrient
availability favored smaller plants with acquisitive leaves,
which facilitated productivity, i.e. high SANPP, during
shorter intervals between disturbance events. However,
aboveground standing biomass accumulated in less disturbed
sites, with plants exhibiting high investments in supporting
tissue.
Inconsistent with the ‘heath’ model, leaf traits had nega-
tive effects on litter decomposition, which we did not expect.
This effect may be explained by decreased litter decomposi-
tion at drier and open sites due to reduced microbial activity,
although high disturbance and fertilization on these sites
favored plants with low leaf dry matter content, which typi-
cally shows enhanced decomposition (DeGryze et al. 2004;
Kazakou et al. 2006).
Diversity effects on ecosystem properties
The results showed that ecosystem properties were best
explained by the average trait value of all species of a com-
munity weighted by their abundance, as predicted by the
mass ratio hypothesis (Grime 1998). Evidence for the species
diversity hypothesis (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997) was not revealed
by our study, most likely because of a scaling effect. Envi-
ronmental gradients control species occurrence patterns by
strong selective pressure on responsive traits, sieving differ-
ent subsets of the total range of trait expressions in the species
poolofalandscape.Consequently,thedistributionoftraitval-
ues in each community converges around a mean describing
each subset (Grime 2006). Over a relatively large gradient
such as that observed in this study, differences between com-
munity means affect ecosystem properties more heavily than
within-community trait dispersion, which is congruent with
Grime’s (1998) mass ratio hypothesis. This is particularly
relevant when the trait values are weighted by abundance,
and therefore emphasize the effect of traits of the most abun-
dant species on ecosystem properties (Díaz et al. 2007b).
However, the importance of within-community functional
dispersion to explain productivity may increase when envi-
ronmental gradients shorten (Schwilk & Ackerly 2005). In a
recent global synthesis of biodiversity–ecosystem function-
ing experiments, Hooper et al. (2012) found that species
losses had to reach high levels (41–60%) to complement
nutrient enrichment effects on productivity. All abiotic con-
ditions including disturbance being equal, it is unlikely to
ﬁnd such variations in species richness in local communi-
ties of our study sites. This may explain why changes in
environmental conditions and resulting changes in functional
trait composition are stronger predictors than trait disper-
sion within communities. However, the relationship between
functionalandspeciesdiversityisnotalwaysstraightforward,
and the question of intra- versus inter-community trait diver-
sity effects on productivity should deserve further attention,
requiring more studies aiming at a simultaneous analysis of
trait responses and effects.
Conclusions
This is one of the ﬁrst studies showing trait responses
to environmental drivers and effects on ecosystem proper-
ties in a simultaneous analysis (Lavorel et al. 2011; Minden
& Kleyer 2011; de Bello et al. 2010). Two different land-
use systems with common history were compared, and
results showed that trait–trait relationships remained consis-
tent, however environmental drivers exhibited marked effects
on how the trait pattern affected carbon related ecosys-
tem properties. Our results indicated that trade-offs and
allometries between traits deﬁned the general spectra in the
functional organization of plants. Plant positions in these
spectra were sorted by land-use intensity, which then resulted
in speciﬁc effects on ecosystem properties, particularly

310

litter decomposition. Productivity was directly or indirectly
inﬂuenced by the leaf economics spectrum, whereas stand-
ing biomass increased with investments in structural tissue.
Most responses and effects were context-depending, suggest-
ing that differences in land use intensity result in speciﬁc
effects on ecosystem properties. The results further reinforce
that traits of the most abundant species have the greatest
effects on ecosystem properties following Grime’s (1998)
mass ratio hypothesis. Functional diversity had hardly any
effect on ecosystem properties. These results suggest that the
relevance of diversity-productivity relationships decreases
with increasing length of environmental gradients. There-
fore, changes in community composition and dominance
hierarchies following environmental change deserve the most
attention when ecosystem properties in natural systems must
be maintained.

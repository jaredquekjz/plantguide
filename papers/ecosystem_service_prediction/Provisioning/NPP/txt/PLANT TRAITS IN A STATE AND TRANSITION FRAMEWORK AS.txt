Abstract.
Understanding and forecasting changes in plant communities, ecosystem
properties, and their associated services requires a mechanistic link between community shifts
and modiﬁcations in ecosystem properties. In this study, we test the hypothesis that plant
traits can provide such a link. Using subalpine grasslands in the central French Alps as a case
study, we investigate the response of plant traits to changes in soil resource availability and
disturbance regimes associated with changing grassland management as well as the effects of
changes in plant traits on measured ecosystem properties. We found that fertilization leads to
greater speciﬁc leaf area and leaf nitrogen content which leads to greater productivity and
faster litter decomposition, and that grazing leads to higher leaf toughness and leaf dry matter
content which leads to lower productivity and slower decomposition compared to mowing. A
state and transition model was used as a ﬂexible conceptual tool for integrating data on
community composition, plant traits, and ecosystem properties in the context of management-
mediated successional dynamics in subalpine grasslands. Focusing on the biology driving the
transition between grassland states, we incorporated plant traits into the formulation of a state
and transition model and demonstrated how they could be used to provide a mechanistic link
between community shifts and ecosystem properties under complex management regimes with
strong land-use legacies.

INTRODUCTION
Land-use change is a major driver of environmental
and biodiversity changes worldwide (Vitousek et al.
1997, Sala et al. 2000). In Europe, seminatural
ecosystems such as grasslands, steppes, heathlands,
mediterranean shrublands, and savanna-type woodlands
are undergoing complex land-use changes. Decreasing
land-use intensity, including complete cessation of
management practices is widespread, with concurrent
concentration of intensive use over smaller areas that are
more productive and accessible (MacDonald et al. 2000,
Schmitzberger et al. 2005). In this context, understand-
ing and forecasting changes in plant communities,
ecosystem properties and their associated services
requires linking community shifts and modiﬁcations in
ecosystem properties using a mechanistic understanding
(Chapin et al. 1997, 2000).
In European mountains, subalpine grasslands are
increasingly abandoned or converted to extensive
summer grazing as traditional mowing practices disap-
pear together with farmers and their ﬂocks (MacDonald
et al. 2000, Olsson et al. 2000, Tasser and Tappeiner
2002, Fischer and Wipf 2002, Lasanta-Martı´nez et al.
2005). Different management practices (fertilization,
irrigation, grazing, cutting, and so on) allow for multiple
combinations of resource availability (nutrients, water)
and disturbance regimes (selectivity, intensity, frequency
and timing of biomass destruction; sensu Grime 1979)
that affect plant persistence as individuals and/or
populations (Pausas and Lavorel 2003). Until 50 years
ago or less, large areas of current subalpine grasslands
were frequently plowed. Their long management history
means that land-use legacies are an essential component
of any understanding of their current dynamics (Dorioz
and van Oort 1991, Tappeiner et al. 1998, Austrheim
and Olsson 1999, Tasser and Tappeiner 2002). Commu-
nity and ecosystem response to current management
practices must therefore be set in the historical context
of those practices (Foster et al. 2003).
State and transition (S and T hereafter) models
(Westoby et al. 1989, Bestelmeyer et al. 2003) provide
a ﬂexible framework that can accommodate complex
and changing management regimes as well as external
drivers (climatic or otherwise) and are often represented
as easy to grasp ‘‘box and arrow’’ diagrams (Allen-Diaz
and Bartolome 1998, Briske et al. 2003, Bestelmeyer et
al. 2004, Cingolani et al. 2005). They were developed to

accommodate the possibility that different stable vege-
tation states (or none) were possible in a given location
or environmental setting (Westoby et al. 1989, Bestel-
meyer et al. 2003, Herrick et al. 2006). In this sense, they
are complementary to earlier approaches based on
‘‘Clementsian’’ succession to unique climax communities
(e.g., Dyksterhuis 1949). Rather than an alternative
theory of vegetation dynamics, S and T models are
essentially used as widely applicable, adaptative, heuris-
tic and empirical tools for understanding and managing
ecosystems (Herrick et al. 2006). Traditionally, they
have focused on descriptions of communities based on
dominant species and/or life forms (e.g., Bork et al.
1997, Yates and Hobbs 1997, Allen-Diaz and Bartolome
1998, Jackson and Bartolome 2002, Jasinski and Payette
2005). More recent formulations have proposed to
generalize their applicability by focusing on plant
functional traits and plant functional groups rather
than on taxonomy (Gondard et al. 2003, Jauffret and
Lavorel 2003). S and T models can also incorporate
ecosystem properties as illustrated in the northern
Chihuahuan desert by Herrick et al. (2002) for
properties relating to rangeland health (Pyke et al.
2002) and ecosystem stability (Havstad and Herrick
2003). In this study, we used an S and T model to
articulate the interlinked dynamics of plant community
composition, plant traits, and ecosystem properties in
response to land-use change, thereby making an
essential step for a solid scientiﬁc basis to ecosystem
management (Grime 2002, Stringham et al. 2003, Briske
et al. 2005).
Plant traits relate to universal plant functions of
growth (e.g., light and nutrient acquisition, water use
efﬁciency) and persistence (e.g., recruitment, dispersal,
defense against herbivores and other disturbances;
Weiher et al. 1999). They provide a widely applicable
framework for interpreting community shifts along
environmental gradients (Hodgson et al. 1999, Corne-
lissen et al. 2003; Lavorel et al., in press). Traits related
to the response of individual plants and communities to
nutrient availability are also markers of ecosystem
processes involved in nutrient cycling (van der Krift
and Berendse 2001, Lavorel and Garnier 2002, Eviner
and Chapin 2003, Garnier et al. 2004). Based on Grime’s
biomass ratio hypothesis (1998), changes in community
composition could thus affect the dynamics of live and
dead biomass (Lavorel and Garnier 2002, Chapin 2003).
Garnier et al. (2004) validated these hypotheses for a set
of mediterranean secondary successional ecosystems.
Based on current knowledge of plant trait responses
to changing grassland management regimes, we formu-
lated an S and T model for a subalpine grassland
landscape in Villar d’Are` ne (Central French Alps). Our
aims were to articulate alternative management practices
(plowing, fertilization, cutting, and grazing) in their
historical context, and to provide some functional
understanding of changes in community composition
and ecosystem processes in response to current and
historical management. We then used this model as a
framework to test two sets of hypotheses regarding the
use of plant traits to simultaneously explain vegetation
and ecosystem responses to management alternatives.
Our ﬁrst set of hypotheses focused on vegetation
response to nutrient availability and disturbance regimes
as they change with land-use practices. We expect that
fertilization, by increasing nutrient availability, will
favor plants with higher speciﬁc leaf area (SLA;
reﬂecting their ability to capture limiting light resourc-
es), higher concentrations of leaf nutrients such as
nitrogen (leaf nitrogen content, LNC) or phosphorus
(leaf phosphorus content, LPC), and with low leaf tissue
density and cell wall content (leaf dry matter content,
LDMC). A number of recent studies have conﬁrmed the
relevance of the nutrient acquisition/conservation trade-
off governing plant nutrient economy (Dı´az et al. 2004,
Wright et al. 2004) to predict changes in plant
communities in response to decreasing land-use intensi-
ty. These include studies across a variety of grassland
types (Ansquer et al. 2004, Louault et al. 2005; S.
Gaucherand and S. Lavorel, unpublished manuscript)
and old ﬁelds (Garnier et al. 2004, Kahmen and
Poschlod 2004). Based on existing knowledge about
plant traits associated with disturbance response, we
expect that conversion from cutting to selective grazing
will favor grazing avoidance through small stature
(Lavorel et al. 1999, Bullock et al. 2001, Stammel et al.
2003; Dı´az et al., in press), protective tussock growth
forms (Callaghan 1988) and lower palatability through
tougher and denser leaves (LDMC; Dı´az et al. 2001,
Pe´ rez-Harguindeguy et al. 2003). Colonization of post-
arable soils is often seed limited (Pywell et al. 2002,
Walker et al. 2004) and we expect that past plowing will
have favored plants that are best equipped for long-
distance dispersal and/or persistent seed bank formation
(Pakeman and Small 2005, Ro¨ mermann et al. 2005). On
the basis of the colonization–competition trade-off in
seed size (Jakobsson and Eriksson 2000, Leishman 2001,
Moles and Westoby 2002), we expect species with
lighter, wind-dispersed seeds to be more abundant in
old ﬁelds recently (,50 years) converted to grasslands
through spontaneous revegetation (Westoby et al. 1996,
Tackenberg et al. 2003).
Our second set of hypothesis concerned the repercus-
sions of vegetation change on ecosystem properties. We
expected leaf traits that are markers of an exploitative
nutrient economy (SLA, LNC; Wright et al. 2004) to
translate into increased primary productivity and litter
decomposition following fertilization (Lavorel and
Garnier 2002, Garnier et al. 2004). Lower palatability
is related to lower litter quality (Cornelissen et al. 1999,
Pe´ rez-Harguindeguy et al. 2000) and we therefore expect
slower ecosystem level nutrient cycling with lower
productivity and higher litter accumulation in grazed
compared to cut grasslands (Zeller et al. 2000).
In this paper, we ﬁrst formulate an S and T model
based on the analysis of coexisting historical land-use

trajectories. We then describe the abiotic and vegetation
characteristics of each of the identiﬁed states, and
analyze transitions among them in terms of changes in
plant traits in response to the associated changes in soil
resource availability and disturbance (our ﬁrst set of
hypotheses). Finally we analyze the role of these changes
in plant traits in measured changes in ecosystem
properties (our second set of hypotheses). Our results
are discussed in the context of mechanisms of changes in
community composition and ecosystem function and
their integration into an S and T framework.
METHODS
Study site
The study site is located on the south facing aspect of
the upper valley of the Romanche River, central French
Alps (Villar d’Are` ne, 458202400 N, 682002400 E; see Plate
1). The substrate is homogenous calc-shale, and the
climate is subalpine with a strong continental inﬂuence
due to a rain shadow with respect to dominant westerly
winds. Mean annual rainfall is 956 mm and the mean
monthly temperatures of 4.68C in January to 118C in
July (at 2050 m above sea level). Rainfall occurs mainly
during the cooler months, with 40% of annual rainfall
during the growing season.
We concentrated on the lower slopes of the study site.
At the lower altitudes (1650–2000 m), former arable
ﬁelds have been abandoned and subsequently converted
to terraced grasslands used for hay or grazing. At mid-
slope (1800–2500 m) ancient, never-plowed hay mead-
ows are increasingly converted to light summer grazing
by sheep or cattle. Some are no longer cut or grazed at
all.
Putting land-use change in its historical context
We used aerial photographs from 1952, 1961, 1971,
1986, and 2001, land-use registers from 1810, 1971, and
1974, and recent data from local farmers (1996 and
2003; Association Foncie` re Pastorale de Villar d’Are` ne,
unpublished data) to build a geographical information
system (GIS) database of past and present land use.
Eighteen generic land-use trajectories were identiﬁed as
successive land-use transitions between management
regimes or as the continuation of a given management
regime. In Villar d’Are` ne, these include arable rotation,
fertilization, hay cutting, spring and autumn grazing,
and summer grazing by cattle or sheep, among others.
Trajectories thus set current land use (e.g., is the
grassland cut for hay or used for summer or spring
grazing by sheep or cattle?) in its historical context (e.g.,
has the ﬁeld been plowed?). Land-use transitions relate
to shifts between alternative grassland states, while stasis
in a given state was hypothesized to be a result of
continued identical management.
The decision to plow sets the starting point in the
documented land-use trajectories (trajectory 1; Table 1).
The decision to cut or graze affects both post-arable
grasslands (trajectories 5, 6, and 7; Table 1) and
grasslands that have never been plowed (trajectories 9
and 10; Table 1). Organic fertilization is currently
undertaken on some previously unfertilized post-arable
hay meadows (trajectory 2; Table 1). All the above land-
use change trajectories are deﬁned only with respect to
current management (as indicated by farmer interviews,
see Daigney 2005; F. Que´ tier, F. Rivoal, P. Marty, J. de
Chazal, and S. Lavorel, unpublished manuscript) and
past land use as available in the GIS. Hypothesizing that
Festuca paniculata, a late-successional perennial tussock
grass (see Plate 1), is an indicator of a longer time since
cessation of arable rotation, we used its current presence
in the ﬁeld to deﬁne two additional trajectories (4 and 7;
Table 1). Longer time since cessation of arable rotation
is not a land-use transition as such but rather reﬂects our
assumption of an underlying old ﬁeld succession. This
assumption, together with the past (plowing) and
current (cutting/grazing and fertilization) differences in
management deﬁned the land-use trajectories under
study, and associated land-use transitions. Land-use
transitions and stases were used to formulate the S and
T model. In addition, as land-use trajectories include
past land use, we were able to embed current land-use
changes in their historical context.

PLANT TRAITS IN A STATE-TRANSITION MODEL

Description of land-use trajectories:
resources, disturbance, and plant traits
Except for continuing arable rotation (trajectory 1),
we sampled three plots per trajectory. Plots were selected
as visually representative of the grassland composition
found on each trajectory and distributed across the
landscape to minimize spatial autocorrelation among
replicates. Inter-plot variations in altitude, slope, and
aspect (measured on the steepest slope of each plot) were
minimized. For each plot, a 15 3 15 m visually
homogenous area was chosen for measurement. Five
land-use trajectories were investigated more thoroughly
over two growing seasons (trajectories 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10)
in 2003 and 2004. The remaining ﬁve trajectories
(trajectories 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11) were only sampled in
2004 (see Appendix).
In each plot, 10 random soil samples (a handful) were
collected in spring below the root zone (between 5 and
15 cm depth). They were mixed, sieved to eliminate
rocks and stones, and analyzed for physical and
chemical properties (Laboratoire d’analyse des sols,
INRA, Arras, France). This sampling protocol and all
that follow were agreed to within a multisite interna-
tional research project (Garnier et al., in press).
Measured variables include pH of soil solution, soil
texture, and soil N, C, K, and P contents (per unit mass).
Two measures of soil P were used: total P using the acid
digestion method (HF; Olsen and Sommers 1982) and
soluble phosphate using Olsen’s procedure (Olsen et al.
1954). Soil texture and organic carbon content were used
to estimate plant available water as the difference in
water content between ﬁeld capacity and wilting point
(following Saxton et al. 1986).
Total N, P, and K contents of soils are ambiguous
measures of nutrient availability for plant growth
(Farruggia et al. 2003). Under non-limiting situations,
N concentrations in herbaceous vegetation show a
decreasing power relationship with above-ground bio-
mass (called the N dilution curve). Although initially
developed for crops (Gastal and Lemaire 2002), the N
dilution curve has been validated in multi-species
grasslands (Duru et al. 1997). It is the same for all C3
plants and does not vary substantially with major
environmental factors other than those affecting soil N
supply (Duru et al. 1997). For a given biomass, it
indicates a critical N concentration corresponding to
non-limiting N availability (Gastal and Lemaire 2002).
The ratio of actual N concentration to this critical
concentration is called the nitrogen nutrition index
(NNI), which we used to establish the degree of N
limitation in each plot. Critical concentrations of P and
K that maximize biomass production for a given level of
N nutrition have been established (Duru and Thelier
1997). Following the same formalism, these were used to
deﬁne P and K nutrition indices that identify P and K
limitations for vegetation growth (PNI and KNI,
respectively; Jouany et al. 2004). In this study, N, P,
and K nutrition indices were calculated from living
vegetative plant parts (stems and leaves) collected before
most species ﬂowered (in mid-June). We used four
random samples of 0.25 m2 in each plot, representing an
area suitable for herbaceous vegetation (Wiegert 1962).
Both mowing and grazing occur once a year. Their
intensities were measured as the percentage of initial
green biomass (quantiﬁed from four 0.25-m2 above-
ground standing biomass random harvests in each plot)
or percentage of initial vegetative height (from 10
random measurements) remaining after disturbance,
using grazing exclosures when necessary. Timing of
disturbance was converted from Julian days to degree
days (d.d.) based on average daily temperature mea-
sured at the study site.
Floristic composition of each plot was assessed using
three nonintersecting point–quadrat survey lines (Daget
and Poissonet 1969). They were 8 m long with one point
every 20 cm for a total of 120 points per plot. The total
number of contacts for each species was counted at each
point of the point-quadrat survey. Species accounting
for 80% of total abundance were identiﬁed and selected
for trait measurement. Traits were measured for species
3 trajectory combinations as species were considered to
have the same trait value across plots of the same land-
use trajectory. The following quantitative plant traits
were measured: plant vegetative height, plant reproduc-
tive height, leaf tensile strength (leaf toughness), leaf dry
matter content (LDMC), speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf
nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content
(LPC), leaf carbon content (LCC), and seed mass.
Leaf traits were measured on 10 individual plants per
land-use trajectory, distributed evenly across the plots
where they were present. Morphological traits were
measured on 20 randomly selected individual plants per
trajectory, distributed evenly across the plots where they
were present. All these measurements followed stan-
dardized protocols (Cornelissen et al. 2003). Chemical
analyses of N, P, and C contents were conducted on
three samples for each species 3 trajectory combination,
obtained by pooling the 10 original leaves sampled in the
three plots of each land-use trajectory (groups of three,
three, and four leaves). Two replicate analyses of C and
N were carried out on each of these samples using a
CHONS micro-analyzer (Carlo Erba 1500; Carlo Erba,
Limito, Italy), and their values averaged. Leaf P content
was analyzed using Kjeldahl mineralization. These
analyses are distinct from those used to calculate the
N, P, and K nutrition indices as these were done on a
plot and not on a species 3 trajectory basis. Seed mass
was measured on 100 seeds collected locally. Data on
dispersal modes (anemochorous, epizoochorous, bar-
ochorous, and myrmechorous) were found in the
literature and ﬂoras (Aeschimann and Burdet 1994,
Lauber and Wagner 2000).
Finally, for each plot, a community aggregated trait
value was calculated using the trait value of each species
in the corresponding trajectory weighted according to
the species relative abundance in the plot. This

aggregated trait value is a quantitative translation of the
biomass ratio hypothesis (Grime 1998), whereby eco-
system properties are related to species relative abun-
dance in a community (Garnier et al. 2004).
Description of land-use trajectories:
vegetation and ecosystem properties
From the point-quadrat survey data, we calculated
species number, Shannon index, and Simpson’s inverse
index for each plot. The total number of contacts gives
an indication of vegetation density in each plot.
Recorded species were classiﬁed into six a priori
morphological groups following Lavorel et al. (1999).
The relative abundance of the six groups (legumes,
graminoids, small rosettes, small leafy stemmed dicots,
large rosettes, and tall leafy stemmed dicots) was
calculated.
Aboveground standing biomass was harvested in each
plot at monthly intervals over the growing season (using
four 0.25 m2 in each plot). Harvest was repeated at three
dates: minimum biomass around 10 May 10 (at 64
degree days), intermediate around 15 June (350 d.d.),
and maximum around 10 July (635 d.d.). At each
harvest, a quarter of the collected biomass was sorted
into senescent and living material (including leaves,
stems, and ﬂowering stalks if present) and oven dried at
608C for 48 h to calculate maximum standing biomass,
percentage of living biomass at maximum standing
biomass, aboveground net primary productivity
(ANPP), and speciﬁc aboveground net primary produc-
tivity (SANPP; biomass increase per unit biomass and
unit time) also called ‘‘ecosystem efﬁciency’’ (Reich et al.
1997). The same calculation was applied to changes in
litter giving a speciﬁc litter net productivity (litter
SANPP). The ﬁrst aboveground biomass harvest of
the season was used to estimate accumulated litter at
snow melt.
In October 2003, a litter bag experiment was initiated
in each plot using 45 polyethylene litter bags (Aerts et al.
2003). For each plot, 15 bags were ﬁlled with 1 g of a
standard litter (common to all plots) and 30 bags with 1
g of litter made from senesced leaves of the plot’s
dominant species. Their litter was collected on the plots
at the end of July 2003 and mixed in the same
abundance proportions as the standing community
(e.g., Knops et al. 2001). A ﬁrst harvest of 15 bags (ﬁve
of standard litter and 10 with litter from the plot itself)
was made at snow melt in April 2004, and a second in
the following autumn (October 2004). Bag contents were
cleaned from soil, dried at 608C, and weighed, giving
native and standard over-winter and annual litter mass
loss.
Light interception and sward height were obtained
weekly over the growing season. Light interception was
calculated by measuring photosynthetic active radiation
(PAR) at three randomly selected locations above and
below the grass cover using a 1 m long measuring rod
(LI-191SA Line Quantum Sensor; LI-COR, Lincoln,
Nebraska, USA). Sward height was calculated as the
average of 10 random measurements in each plot. We
used maximum, minimum, and snow-melt sward height
in our study. By dividing light interception by maximum
and minimum cover height, respectively, we were able to
calculate a maximum and minimum cover density (light
interception per volume of vegetation).
Statistical analysis
Making no assumptions on the normality of the data,
we used non parametric Kruskall-Wallis tests to identify
statistically signiﬁcant differences between states for soil
variables, disturbance variables, abundance of a priori
morphological groups, biodiversity variables, commu-
nity aggregated trait values for whole plant traits, leaf
traits, reproductive traits, and ecosystem properties.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using environ-
mental factors as covariables was performed to test
hypotheses on trait response to fertilization and
disturbance. ANCOVA was also used to test hypotheses
on trait effects on ecosystem properties and community
composition. As an example, to test whether the increase
in leaf nitrogen content (LNC) following transition T20
was the effect of the fertilization per se or was the result
of an increase in light interception by the grass cover, we
used maximum light interception as a covariable in
testing differences in LNC between grassland states A1
and A2. These results are illustrated using box and
arrow diagrams where input variables (e.g., maximum
light interception) that are sufﬁcient to account for
changes in an output variable (e.g., LNC) are linked
with an arrow going from the input to the output
variable (see Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Statistical analyses were
carried out using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois,
USA).
RESULTS
State and transition model for seminatural grasslands
in Villar d’Are`ne
Land-use trajectories (Table 1) were arranged into a
common framework where they are interpreted as
successive changes in management (corresponding to
land-use transitions) initiated from either an arable
rotation or a continuously cut hay meadow, and leading
to contrasting grassland states (Fig. 1).
Today, arable ﬁelds could still be plowed (trajectory 1
in Table 1; ‘‘arable rotation’’ in Fig. 1) or constitute post
arable grasslands that are cut (trajectories 2, 3, and 4 in
Table 1; states A1 and A2 in Fig. 1) or grazed
(trajectories 5, 6, and 7 in Table 1; state A3 in Fig. 1).
Cut post-arable grasslands can be fertilized on a regular
basis (trajectory 2 in Table 1; state A1 in Fig. 1) or not
(trajectories 3 and 4 of Table 1; state A2 in Fig. 1).
Fertilization levels are low with a local maximum of 8 to
10 Mgha1yr1 of farm-yard manure (Picart and
Fleury 1999). Never-plowed grasslands can still be cut
(trajectory 8 in Table 1; state C1 in Fig. 1), be grazed
(trajectories 9 and 10 in Table 1; state C2 in Fig. 1), or

not used (trajectory 11 in Table 1; state C2 in Fig. 1).
When no signiﬁcant differences were found between
trajectories in soil resources, disturbance regime, ﬂoristic
composition, ecosystem properties, or plant traits
(results not shown), they were pooled into common
grassland states. Hence we merged trajectories 5 and 6 to
form state A3, and trajectories 9, 10, and 11 to form
state C2 (Table 1).
No recently converted arable ﬁelds were studied. No
data is available on the short term colonization
occurring after arable rotation ceased (undocumented
transient state X; Fig. 1). Post-arable grasslands (states
A1, A2, and A3; Fig. 1) were pooled into a block of
states (A) within which we consider transitions to be
reversible within a management time frame. Although
no data is available on the duration of transitions T2
and T20 local farmers told us that a few years of annual
fertilization (T20) are enough to see changes in ﬂoristic
composition and productivity of grasslands (Tasser and
Tappeiner 2002). The reversibility of transition T3 is
more uncertain as transition T30 was not documented in
our study.
States C form another block within which transitions
are considered reversible. We documented transition T8
between state C1 and C2 following a change from hay
cutting to grazing or abandonment (no agricultural use).
Transition T80 was documented in a similar site a few
kilometers away (Bernard-Brunet et al. 1981, Jouglet
and Dore´ e 1981, 1987, Bornard and Cozic 1986). It can
be achieved using early cutting (before ear emergence of
Festuca paniculata) or intensive grazing by cattle or
horses (70 to 80 standard livestock unitsd1ha1;
Jouglet and Dore´ e 1991).

We propose that post arable grasslands where Festuca
paniculata is present (trajectories 4 and 7) represent
transient states in a post-arable colonization process by
this species. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 as states B1 and
B2 linking post-arable grasslands (state X) to states C
(directly or via states A). In the following we explore the
effects of this successional pathway by comparing blocks
of states A, B, and C.
Land-use transition effects
Nutrient availability and disturbance regimes.—Table 2
summarizes the results of statistical analyses. The
hypothetical successional gradient from blocks of states
A to B to C was associated with increases in altitude and
slope (P , 0.001 and P ¼ 0.008 respectively, df ¼ 2).
Concurrent strong gradients in soil properties were
observed, with pH and both total and available P
content decreasing while NNI increased (Table 2). No
signiﬁcant differences in disturbance regime were
detected along the gradient. For transitions within
blocks of states, steeper slopes in C2 compared to C1
were the only signiﬁcant differences in topography,
consistent with steeper slopes being more likely to be
converted to grazing or abandoned.
Few differences in soil texture and no differences in
soil water were associated with land-use transitions
(Table 2). On the other hand signiﬁcant differences in
soil nutrients were detected. Nitrogen was assessed as
limiting for plant growth in all grassland states (NNI
below 80%) but nevertheless increased under regular

PLANT TRAITS IN A STATE-TRANSITION MODEL

organic fertilization (from 58% to 70% under transition
T20; Table 2). However, organic fertilization did not
appear to increase signiﬁcantly the size of the soil N or P
pools. Conversion to grazing was associated with a
lower soil P (halved for transition T3, using Olsen’s
procedure). Signiﬁcant increases in soil pH were also
associated with decreases in the intensity of land-use
such as cessation of fertilization (T2; from 6.8 to 7.3),
and cessation of mowing in either formerly plowed (T3;
from 7.3 to 7.7) or unplowed grasslands (T8; from 5.4 to
6.2; Table 2).
The proportion of aboveground biomass harvested by
mowing increased by 66% following fertilization (T20)
compared to unfertilized ﬁelds (Table 2). On the other
hand, conversion from mowing to light grazing (T3 and
T8) induced more complex changes in disturbance
regimes. Disturbance becomes selective and occurs
earlier (T3, from 1006 to 418 degree days on average)
with lower intensity (T8, from 84% to 19% height loss;
Table 2).
Vegetation structure.—Plant diversity (both Shannon
and Simpson’s inverse index) decreased along the
successional gradient across blocks of states A to B
and C, concurrent with an increase in the relative
abundance of graminoids (including Festuca panicula-
ta), and a decrease in legumes (Table 3).
No signiﬁcant changes in species number or diversity
were detected following fertilization (T20) although a
strong species turnover occurred. Six out of 13 dominant
species (making up 80% of total abundance) were lost
(e.g., Briza media, Avenula pubescens, Helianthemum
grandiﬂorum, and Sesleria caerulea), whereas 13 species
were gained (e.g., Centaurea montana, Caerophyllum
hirsutum, Gentiana lutea, Geranium sylvaticum, Herac-
leum sphondylium, Taraxacum ofﬁcinale). This strongly
modiﬁed vegetation structure, with a decrease in the
relative abundance of graminoids by 30% (especially
stress-tolerant species such as Bromus erectus and
Sesleria caerulea; results not shown) and up to a sixfold
increase in large leafy stemmed dicots such as Gentiana
lutea (Table 3).
Conversion to grazing on former arable ﬁelds (T3)
had no signiﬁcant effect on the relative abundance of
morphological types (Table 3). However, palatable grass
species such as Dactylis glomerata and Trisetum
ﬂavescens were lost from the 80% most abundant species

while less palatable grasses such as Bromus erectus and
Sesleria caerulea became more dominant. Abandonment
or conversion of C2 grasslands to light grazing (T8) also
led to a substantial turnover of species. Conversion to
sheep grazing (trajectory 10 of Table 1) led to a loss of
half the dominant species (e.g., Centaurea uniﬂora,
Potentilla grandiﬂora, Trifolium alpinum) that was not
fully compensated by a gain of four species (e.g., Bromus
erectus, Daclylis glomerata). Relative abundance of
Festuca paniculata increased noticeably (but not signif-
icantly; v2 ¼ 1.034, P ¼ 0.309, df ¼ 1) to reach 61%
driving an overall increase in the relative abundance of
grasses (up 30%), while tall leafy dicots and small species
decreased. Species loss and gain were even under
conversion to cattle grazing (trajectory 9 of Table 1).
Ecosystem properties.—As vegetation density in-
creased by 50% under fertilization (T20), maximum light
interception doubled reaching 70% (Table 3). ANPP and
SANPP both increased (þ30% for early season SANPP),
resulting in a maximum standing aboveground biomass
of 4.5 Mg/ha dry mass in fertilized hay meadows.
Decomposition of native litter in these meadows was
signiﬁcantly faster than that of unfertilized meadows
(A2), where average annual mass loss reached 33%. We
observed less litter accumulated in spring in the fertilized
A1 (0.5 Mg/ha dry mass) than in A2 grasslands (1.3 Mg/
ha dry mass). No differences were detected for standard
litter decomposition, indicating no signiﬁcant changes in
the decomposition environment.
Abandonment or conversion to grazing of C1
grasslands divided SANPP by 3. Maximum standing
aboveground biomass doubled. It reached over 8 Mg/ha
dry matter in C2 grasslands. Litter decomposition in C2
grasslands (25% annual litter mass loss) was 30% slower
than in C1 grasslands where over 6 Mg/ha of litter was
accumulated in the early spring (Table 3). Half of the
peak standing biomass was senescent in C2 grasslands.
As in the case of fertilization (transition T20), no
differences were detected in annual litter mass loss for
standard litter (v2 ¼ 0.429, P ¼ 0.513, df ¼ 1).
Community-level plant traits.—Following Garnier et
al. (2004), we compared the aggregated trait value across
grassland states. Plant trait values reported in the text
and in the Appendix refer to the community-aggregated
trait values in each state or changes associated with
various land-use transitions.
Anemochorous dispersal decreased signiﬁcantly as
seed mass increased from states A to C (Table 4).
Comparing states A with states B and C, we detected an
increase in LDMC indicating a shift from nutrient
acquisition to nutrient conservation strategies (Table 5).
LNC and SLA only responded marginally (Table 5).
Leaf toughness is signiﬁcantly higher in C states than in
B states (v2 ¼ 10.125, P ¼ 0.001, df ¼ 1).
As hypothesized, fertilization (T20) increased values
for leaf traits such as SLA (up by one-third, reaching 18
m2/kg), LNC and LPC (Table 5). Leaf traits that are
markers of leaf nutrient economy (Wright et al. 2004)
were found to be correlated (e.g., LNC and LPC at r ¼
0.94, Pearson’s t ¼ 10.1709, P . 0.0001, df ¼ 13),
representing a syndrome of trait response to fertiliza-
tion. LDMC and leaf toughness showed an expected
opposite response, with leaves being six times tougher in
A1 than in A2 grasslands (Table 5). Plant height
increased by one-third following fertilization (Table 5),
reaching an average of 26 cm.
Past land use (plowing) affected trait responses to
conversions to grazing (Table 5). In never-plowed hay
meadows (T8), plant height increased from 30 to 40 cm
and signiﬁcant changes were detected for leaf traits: LPC
and LDMC decreased (Table 5). Leaf toughness did not
increase signiﬁcantly (v2 ¼ 1.190, P ¼ 0.275, df ¼ 1) but
nevertheless reached its highest value in C2 grasslands
(12 kg/cm tensile strength). Festuca paniculata is the
dominant species in these grasslands and its leaves are
over 50% tougher (17 kg/cm) than the second toughest
leaves measured in this study (Festuca nigrescens, 11 kg/
cm). When excluding F. paniculata from the calculation
of community aggregated traits, LDMC and plant
stature showed no response (v2 ¼ 1.923, N ¼ 12, P ¼
0.166 and v2 ¼ 0.419, N ¼ 12, P ¼ 0.518, respectively). In
the case of conversion to grazing on former arable ﬁelds
(T3), leaf toughness increased by 50%. As expected,
LNC and SLA decreased (30% to 10 m2/kg; Table 5).
Finally, seed mass decreased by over one-third when
mowing ceased in previously plowed grasslands (T3; 0.3
g for 100 seeds in state A3; Table 4).
Linking nutrient availability and disturbance
to ecosystem properties via plant traits
ANCOVA revealed that trait response to changes in
nutrient availability were mediated by the intensity of
light competition. We found that statistically, changes in

PLANT TRAITS IN A STATE-TRANSITION MODEL

LNC under transition T20 could be explained by
increasing light interception (F ¼ 7.385, df ¼ 1, 2, P ¼
0.073; see Fig. 2). Under transition T3 on the other
hand, some changes in leaf traits that are markers of leaf
nutrient economy could be explained by changes in the
soil. Lower LNC for example was statistically explained
by a lower soil total P (Fig. 3, Table 2). No signiﬁcant
relationship was detected with LPC although LPC and

LNC are highly correlated across sampled ﬁeld sites (r ¼
0.94, P , 0.0001).
The increase in the percentage of biomass harvested (a
measure of disturbance intensity) following fertilization
(T20) explained changes in leaf traits (Table 2), but not
the increase in plant height (the effect of T20 is still
signiﬁcant in the ANCOVA; F ¼ 28.447, df ¼ 1, 2, P ¼
0.013). Changes in disturbance date or percentage of
height loss (another measure of disturbance intensity)
associated with the conversion of C1 grasslands from
mowing to grazing or abandonment (T8) explained the
increase in plant stature and the decrease in LDMC
(Fig. 4, Table 2). However, in this case these changes in
traits could also reﬂect the increase in abundance of
Festuca paniculata (Fig. 4).
Changes in plant traits associated with land-use
transitions were often sufﬁcient to statistically explain
changes in ecosystem properties (Table 5). Using stature
as a covariable, ANCOVA results indicate that the
abundance of taller plants explained the higher vegeta-
tion density (F ¼ 1.872, df ¼ 1, 2, P ¼ 0.265) and
increased light interception (F ¼ 1, df ¼ 1, 2, P ¼ 0.391)
following fertilization (Fig. 2). Likewise, increased early
season SANPP in A1 relative to A2 grasslands could be
explained by differences in the marker leaf traits of the
plant nutrient economy spectrum (increasing SLA,
LNC, LPC, and decreasing LDMC; Table 5). Changes
in leaf toughness or LDMC explained changes in
accumulated litter following fertilization (T20, decrease)
or conversion to grazing (T3 and T8, increase; Table 5).
Increased LDMC also explained the lower litter
decomposition rate in C1 as compared to C2 grasslands
(T8; Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Within the proposed S and T model, we ﬁrst tested a
set of hypotheses on plant trait response to changing
fertility and disturbance under complex land-use change.
A second set of hypotheses concerned the ecosystem
effects of changes in plant traits. We ﬁrst return to these
hypotheses and then discuss the insights gained from
integrating plant-trait-based approaches to vegetation
and ecosystem dynamics with the ﬂexible S and T model
approach.
Response of vegetation structure to fertility
and disturbance via plant traits
By using the N, P, and K nutrition indices, we
assessed the difference between the sward’s nutritional
requirements and what it ﬁnds in the soil, as calculated
using the critical N curves described in Methods. We
were able to detect increases in N availability (e.g.,
between blocks A, B, and C and following organic
fertilization; T20) without signiﬁcant changes in the total
soil N pool because not all soil N is available for plant
growth.
As well as increasing nutrient availability, organic
fertilization increased incoming light interception, which
should result in increased competition for light. Suc-
cessful plants outgrow their competitors through taller
stature and faster growth rates (Goldberg and Landa
1991, Aerts 1999). Faster growth is achieved through
increased SLA and LNC, and decreased LDMC
(Chapin 1993, Poorter and Garnier 1999). Similar

PLANT TRAITS IN A STATE-TRANSITION MODEL

response patterns have been observed in other mountain
grasslands, where fertilization was associated with a
shift toward nutrient acquisition strategies (Bahn et al.
1999, Ansquer et al. 2004, Louault et al. 2005; S.
Gaucherdand and S. Lavorel, unpublished manuscript).
Within the plant community, species with traits pro-
moting nutrient acquisition increased in abundance with
regular fertilization. In our study, stress-tolerant grami-
noids (such as Briza media and Sesleria caerulea) were
replaced by taller fast-growing dicots with leafy stems
(such as Centaurea montana, Caerophyllum hirsutum, or
Geranium sylvaticum), resulting in a distinct grassland
physionomy. Contrary to many observations in mon-
tane and subalpine pastures, however, fertilization did
not result in a decrease in species number or diversity
(Cernusca et al. 1996, Myklestad and Sætersdal 2004; see
also Gough et al. 2000 for other vegetation types),
probably because levels of nutrient availability remained
relatively low even under regular organic fertilization (as
indicated by NNI , 80%). Although we do not know
what the exact amounts of fertilizer applications were in
our ﬁeld plots, locally, the highest fertilization rates

reach 40–50 Mg/ha of farmyard manure every ﬁve years
(Picart and Fleury 1999).
In more nutrient-limiting situations, disturbance
selectivity favors disturbance avoidance as indicated by
the increase in leaf toughness (Dı´az et al. 2001). Tussock
architecture is an efﬁcient way of avoiding grazing
(Briske 1996), and tussock grasses such as Bromus
erectus and Festuca paniculata are favored when hay
meadows are converted to grazing (see Plate 1). This
decreases the overall palatability of the grassland and,
when given the choice, sheep and cattle only consume
around 15% of the standing biomass (disturbance
intensity in C2 grasslands). Such changes have been
commonly observed in many grasslands of the world
(Sternberg et al. 1999, Brzosko 2001; Dı´az et al., in
press), in particular in montane and subalpine meadows
(Dorioz and van Oort 1991, Tappeiner and Cernusca
1993, Austrheim et al. 1999, Tasser et al. 1999, Barbaro
et al. 2000, Fischer and Wipf 2002, Casals et al. 2004,
Sebastia` et al. 2004).
We found that past plowing favored plants with
lighter, wind-dispersed seeds. This is consistent with our
hypothesis that species with lighter, wind-dispersed
seeds will be more abundant in old ﬁelds recently (,50
years) converted to grasslands through spontaneous
revegetation (Westoby et al. 1996, Tackenberg et al.
2003).
On never-plowed grasslands, both light grazing and
abandonment lead from C1 to C2 grasslands. This
suggests that, at our site, dense Festuca paniculata
dominated grasslands may be an arrested successional
stage (or para-climax [Connell and Slatyer 1977]), rather
than moving toward colonization by dwarf shrubs as
observed in many other subalpine grasslands after
cessation of mowing or grazing (e.g., Pe´ rez-Chaco´ n
Espino and Vabre 1987, Tappeiner and Cernusca 1993,
Tasser and Tappeiner 2002). Similar pathways have
been described under a diversity of other unproductive
climatic and edaphic conditions, such as in lowland
grasslands (e.g., Mitchley and Willems 1995, Kleijn
2003, Liancourt 2005), montane grasslands (e.g., Moog
et al. 2002, Barbaro et al. 2000), Mediterranean old
ﬁelds (e.g., Escarre´ et al. 1983), or temperate heathlands
(e.g., Berendse et al. 1994).
Overall, our results validate our hypotheses on trait
response to fertility and disturbance. By linking changes

in fertility and disturbance to relevant leaf and plant
traits, our results also show how plant traits can
contribute to a process-based understanding of land-
use change effects on vegetation structure.
Vegetation response to fertility and disturbance affects
biogeochemistry via plant traits
Changes in plant traits in response to fertility and
disturbance regimes appeared to directly translate to
changes in ecosystem functioning, as a result of overlap
between these traits and traits that govern biogeochem-
istry (Lavorel and Garnier 2002). Hence the shift in the
nutrient economy of the dominant plants from conser-
vation to acquisition in response to regular fertilization
accounted for the increase in speciﬁc net aboveground
primary productivity. Similar effects were found for
Mediterranean old ﬁeld succession (Garnier et al. 2004).
No difference was detected in the decomposition rate of
standard litter, suggesting that lower LDMC accounted
for faster leaf litter decomposition (Cornelissen et al.
1999, Pe´ rez-Harguindeguy et al. 2000, Garnier et al.
2004). This resulted in less accumulated litter. Similarly,
more selective and less intense disturbance (conversion
to grazing in T3 and T8) favored nutrient conservative

(refer to Fig. 2 for a brief explanation). The dashed box and arrows represent the fact that when the dominant tussock grass Festuca

species whose share of internal N recycling at senescence
is higher. Such changes slow down the N cycle and lower
leaf litter quality (Loiseau et al. 2005). Here, the increase
in leaf toughness following conversion to grazing had an
indirect effect on nutrient cycling through lower
decomposability, leading to higher levels of litter
accumulation.
The above changes are consistent with changes in
marker leaf traits (e.g., LDMC, LNC) indicating faster
individual growth rates (i.e., higher N uptake rates) and
higher litter decomposition rates (i.e., higher N restitu-
tion rates; Garnier et al. 2004). Such changes may be
related to direct responses of soil microbial communities
to fertilization through N mineralization (e.g., Zeller et
al. 2000) in addition to direct effects of changes in the
quality of plant material (Gu¨ swell et al. 2005, Loiseau et
al. 2005). Overall, these results strengthen the recently
growing body of evidence for the role of plant traits in
ecosystem functioning (Grime 2002, Lavorel and Gar-
nier 2002, Chapin 2003; Lavorel et al., in press). The sets
of correlational relationships highlighted by our analysis
would need to be further explored using more sophis-
ticated methods such as path analysis (Vile et al. 2006) in
order to clarify causal chains between environmental
variables, ecosystem properties and traits such as LNC
and LPC.
By analyzing the effects of changing land-use and
abiotic conditions on community-level plant traits and
linking these quantitatively to changes in ecosystem
properties, we showed that key traits associated with
plant mineral resource economy are sufﬁcient to explain
basic biogeochemical processes such as above-ground
primary productivity and litter dynamics (but see Eviner
and Chapin [2003] regarding more complex processes).
Our results thereby also support the biomass ratio
hypothesis (Grime 1998), demonstrating that species
effects on biogeochemistry may be directly proportional
to their abundance (Garnier et al. 2004).
Long term land-use dynamics set the context for
trait mediated vegetation and ecosystem response
to current management
Our results show that the historical context of
management decisions to cut or graze (T3 and T8) is
important. Being set on higher and steeper slopes, grazed
ﬁelds have probably received less organic fertilization
during their long agricultural and pastoral history. As
soil P is not very labile, this potentially explains higher
soil P contents in grasslands that are still cut for hay in the
current farming context. Similar land-use legacies involv-
ing long lasting effects of fertilization on soil P have been
identiﬁed elsewhere in subalpine grasslands (e.g., Schu¨ tz
et al. 2003) or forests (Dupouey et al. 2002, Fraterrigo et
al. 2005). The decrease of soil P content from states A to B
and C is consistent with this interpretation.
We also found an increase in N availability from
states A to B to C. The higher NNI of A1 grasslands did
not compensate for the low NNI of A2 and A3

grasslands as compared to the high NNI of both C1 and
C2 grasslands. The detected decrease in pH from states
A to B to C was consistent with other studies of
secondary succession in highly constrained environ-
ments (e.g., Cernusca et al. 1996, Tasser et al. 1999). The
observed increase in plant stature and seed mass, and the
shift to nutrient conservation strategies from states A to
B and C were also consistent with other studies
investigating trait response during the herbaceous
phases of secondary succession (Prach et al. 1997,
Garnier et al. 2004, Kahmen and Poschlod 2004). Our
results thus suggest that long-term successional dynam-
ics (where response takes a few decades) interact with
short-term changes in management (where response
takes a few years) to explain the dynamics of vegetation
and ecosystem properties in subalpine grasslands of
Villar d’Are` ne (e.g., Cernusca et al. 1996, Austrheim and
Olsson 1999).
In this study, the S and T approach has proven useful
in integrating both of these time scales into a common
operational framework. Their ﬂexibility lies in that S
and T models can be used as both heuristic and
empirical tools. They are easy to modify to reﬂect
evolving knowledge and have thereby proved useful in
the development of hypotheses on ecological processes
(Allen-Diaz and Bartolome 1998, Bestelmeyer et al.
2003, Briske et al. 2003, Herrick et al. 2006). Here, we
successfully used an S and T framework to demonstrate
how plant functional traits can be used as markers of
processes occurring on both long and short time scales
(Didham and Watts 2005), providing a mechanistic
interpretation of vegetation and ecosystem responses to
complex past and present land-use changes (Grime 2002,
Briske et al. 2005).
Incorporating process-based understanding of vegetation
and ecosystem dynamics into a state and transition
framework using plant traits
As previously argued, rather than considering grass-
lands states A and C as alternative stable states resulting
from past plowing, our results thus suggest considering
them as successional stages. Grassland management
decisions to cut or graze usually take into account a
multiplicity of factors including ecosystem properties
(productivity and palatability) and technical constraints
(possibility of mechanized cutting on steep slopes). Local
farmers, however, highlighted that, in Villar d’Are` ne,
ecological feedbacks associated with management are
secondary to the technical constraints of slope and
elevation when deciding to use a ﬁeld for hay harvesting
or grazing. However, experimental research has shown
that in the case of C2 grasslands (dominated by Festuca
paniculata) the conversion back to species-rich meadows
(C1 grasslands) requires very speciﬁc management
actions such as early season mowing and grazing at a
relatively high stocking rate (transition T80 as docu-
mented in Jouglet and Dore´ e [1981, 1987, 1991]). These
decisions are unlikely in the current economic context
(Quiblier and Senn 2004). As a result, C2 grasslands
could be considered as the end point of all vegetation
dynamics of subalpine grasslands in Villar d’Are` ne.
State and transition models were developed to
accommodate possible alternative vegetation states
(e.g., Allen-Diaz and Bartolome 1998; see also Jackson
and Bartolome 2002 on non-equilibrium dynamics).
Although we found that the effects of fertilization
(transition T20) on ecosystem properties (via plant traits;
Fig. 2) are rapid, these effects may persist for many
years. The cessation of fertilization (T2) could thus
induce a slow trait and ecosystem response (e.g., Schu¨ tz
et al. 2003). Also, dispersal limitations could slow the
underlying successional dynamics described above (e.g.,
Fischer and Sto¨ cklin 1997, Stampﬂi and Zeiter 1999)
leading to transient states that can be considered as
stable in a management time frame (e.g., Valone et al.
2002). In spite of the strong argument for considering
that grassland states A, B, and C are stages in a
predictable successional pathway to C2 grasslands, the S
and T framework allows alternative stable states to
remain as both a working hypothesis for further
enquiry, and as a management tool for manipulating
subalpine grasslands in Villar d’Are` ne.
In relation to the above considerations, our results also
show that trait responses to changes from mowing to
grazing differed on the basis of past plowing. In post-
arable grasslands, we found an expected decrease in leaf
nutrient concentration (LNC and LPC) while leaf
toughness increased as grazing avoidance is favored
(Figs. 3 and 4). On never-plowed grasslands, on the other
hand, we observed a decrease in LDMC as plant height
increases (Fig. 4). In the latter, trait responses were not
signiﬁcant when the dominant Festuca paniculata was
excluded from the community aggregated trait calcula-
tion, indicating strong species-speciﬁc effects on the trait
and ecosystem response to changes in management (Fig.
4). This underlies the possible keystone role F. paniculata
plays in driving ecosystem dynamics in never plowed
grasslands. Further understanding of these dynamics will
require a more detailed understanding of this species’
biology and ecology, and especially of its regeneration
niche (Poschlod et al. 1998).
The S and T approach was developed in part to help
frame ecosystem management within temporal variability
in climate (e.g., Westoby et al. 1989, Milton and
Hoffmann 1994). In this study, plant traits were useful
in revealing that distinct dynamics operate in former
arable ﬁelds and never plowed grasslands. These ﬁndings
suggest that past plowing has a long term effects (land-use
legacy) on ecological processes in subalpine grasslands.
Land-use legacies can also—and indeed should—be
incorporated into S and T based approaches to vegetation
and ecosystem dynamics (e.g., Prober et al. 2002).
CONCLUSION
We successfully used a state and transition framework
to demonstrate how plant functional traits can be used to

provide a mechanistic interpretation of vegetation and
ecosystem responses to complex past and present land-
use changes (Grime 2002, Briske et al. 2005). We show
that resuming regular organic fertilization increases
ecosystem efﬁciency (speciﬁc net aboveground primary
productivity) and accelerates nutrient cycling by selecting
taller plants with greater leaf nitrogen content through
increased light competition. Conversion from indiscrim-
inate cutting (for hay) to selective grazing leads to slower
biogeochemical cycles. Unpalatable plants, with tough
leaves or high leaf dry matter content, are favored,
leading to high accumulations of standing dead biomass
and litter. As functional markers (sensu Garnier et al.
2004) plant traits serve to link grassland response to
management changes to their repercussion on ecosystem
properties, on both the short time scale of current
management alternatives (fertilization, cutting, grazing)
and long term successional dynamics as they are affected
by arable land-use legacies. We therefore conclude that
plant traits provide a welcome addition to state and
transition models when making projections or predic-
tions of ecosystem response to management options.

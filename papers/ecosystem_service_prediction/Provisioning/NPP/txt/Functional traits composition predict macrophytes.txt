Abstract
Functional trait composition of plant communities has been proposed as a
helpful key for understanding the mechanisms of biodiversity effects on ecosys-
tem functioning. In this study, we applied a step-wise modeling procedure to
test the relative effects of taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and func-
tional diversity on macrophytes community productivity along water depth gra-
dient. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants and measured 16
functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. Results showed that
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in taxonomic diversity, functional identity (i.e.,
stem dry mass content, leaf [C] and leaf [N]), and functional diversity (i.e.,
ﬂoating leaf, mean Julian ﬂowering date and rooting depth) with increasing
water depth. For the multiple-trait functional diversity (FD) indices, functional
richness decreased, while functional divergence increased with water depth gra-
dient. Macrophyte community productivity was strongly determined by func-
tional trait composition within community, but not signiﬁcantly affected by
taxonomic diversity. Community-weighted means (CWM) showed a two times
higher explanatory power relative to FD indices in determining variations in
community productivity. For nine of sixteen traits, CWM and FD showed sig-
niﬁcant correlations with community productivity, although the strength and
direction of those relations depended on selected trait. Furthermore, functional
composition in a community affected productivity through either additive or
opposite effects of CWM and FD, depending on the particular traits being con-
sidered. Our results suggested both mechanisms of mass ratio and niche com-
plementarity
can
operate
simultaneously
on
variations
in
community
productivity, and considering both CWM and FD would lead to a more pro-
found understanding of traits–productivity relationships.
Introduction
Experimental and ﬁeld researches have documented a
positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem
functioning for a number of ecosystems (Loreau et al.
2001; Hooper et al. 2005, 2012; Cardinale et al. 2011).
Two main candidate mechanisms have been proposed to
explain positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning rela-
tionships: selection and complementarity effects (Loreau
et al. 2001). Selection effects occur when the most pro-
ductive species are more likely to be included in species-
rich
communities
and
had
greatest
species-speciﬁc

impacts on biomass (Fargione et al. 2007; Wang et al.
2013). Complementarity effects are thought to occur
when species exhibit various forms of niche partitioning
or facilitation that allow for a more complete use of
resources in space or time and therefore larger inﬂuences
on ecosystem functioning (Cardinale et al. 2007; Reich
et al. 2012). Although most previous studies have mainly
focused on taxonomic diversity (e.g., species richness) as
measures of biodiversity related to ecosystem processes
(Hooper et al. 2005), all of the mechanisms by which
diversity is expected to affect ecosystem functioning strongly
depend on the functional characteristics of local communi-
ties (McGill et al. 2006; Dıaz et al. 2007; Hillebrand et al.
2008; Mokany et al. 2008; Roscher et al. 2012).
Functional trait composition of communities, manifest-
ing the major aspects of biodiversity, is a key component
that most often explains ecosystem functioning better
than species richness per se (Dı́ az and Cabido 2001; Dıaz
et al. 2007; Flynn et al. 2011; Lavorel and Grigulis 2012;
Roscher et al. 2013). Functional trait composition can be
quantiﬁed by two main components: CWM (i.e., the
average trait value of the species) and different indices of
functional diversity (FD, i.e., the distribution of trait val-
ues representing the degree of overlap in trait values
within the community) (Garnier et al. 2004; Mason et al.
2005). Ecosystem functioning is primarily determined by
trait values of the dominant species to plant biomass, and
thus can be predicted by CWM as suggested by mass ratio
hypothesis (Grime 1998; Dıaz et al. 2007; Roscher et al.
2012). Moreover, a larger functional dissimilarity among
plant species is likely to increase the diversity in strategies
of resource acquisition, which greatly promotes primary
productivity
as
predicted
by
niche
complementarity
hypothesis (Dı́ az and Cabido 2001; Petchey and Gaston
2002, 2006). Despite the fact that the effects of FD on
productivity were greatly dependent on the traits or
niches considered, recent studies have reported that both
components will be valuable predictors for primary pro-
ductivity (Mouillot et al. 2011; Roscher et al. 2013).
Overall, taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and
functional diversity of plant communities are each known
to determining community productivity, but their relative
effects remain highly controversial (Hooper et al. 2005;
Mouillot et al. 2011). Nevertheless, all these biodiversity
components are not inherently exclusive and may simulta-
neously contribute to the variations in community produc-
tivity along environmental gradients (Mouillot et al. 2011).
In this study, we aimed to test the relative effects of
taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional
diversity on macrophytes community productivity along
water depth gradient. First, we test how different mea-
sures of diversity and community productivity change
along the gradient. Second, we examine whether the
effects of functional trait composition on productivity are
largely dependent on speciﬁc traits. Finally, we assess the
relative importance of taxonomic diversity, functional
identity (CWM), and functional diversity (FD) in deter-
mining the macrophytes community productivity along
the gradient.
Materials and Methods
Field sampling designs
This study was carried out in Erhai Lake (25°520N,
100°060E) in Yunnan Province, China. In this Lake, mac-
rophytes species showed a zonation distribution along
water depth gradient. Most of macrophyte species can
inhabit and dominate in the shallow water (e.g., 0–3.0 m
depth), and only a few species can extent to deeper water.
Macrophytes community composition and biomass were
estimated in forty-two 25-m2 plots at seven sites of this
lake (Fu et al. 2013). Sites were selected to represent the
full range of water depth gradient and macrophytes com-
munity variation along this gradient. At each site, six
5 9 5 m plots were located along the water depth gradi-
ent in each 0.5-m interval as a depth stratus, extending
from 0 m to 3.0 m water depth. The plots were randomly
assigned to these six water depth gradients within macro-
phyte species dominated areas. Locations that were dis-
turbed by recent human activity (e.g., mowing and
ﬁshing) were also excluded from sampling. Within each
25-m2 plot, there were three 0.2 m2 quadrats that we used
for this analysis, as in these plots all species had been
identiﬁed and recorded during ﬁeldwork in October and
September of 2011. Samples were collected using a rotat-
able reaping hook (diameter = 0.5 m, area = 0.2 m2),
and it can usually uproot the vast majority of individuals
within the quadrat in mud. The biomass of 17 macro-
phyte species within each of 126 quadrats was collected at
each plot. Sampled plants were spun to remove excess
water (about 3 min) and weighted to the nearest 0.10 kg
fresh weight (FW). To measure the dry weight (gm2) of
each species in each quadrat, we randomly collected 10–
30 samples, weighted after oven-dried at 80°C for 48 h,
and calculated the average wet per dry weight ratio for
each species. The biomass of each species (community
productivity) in each plot was calculated as the averaged
biomass of each species and total biomass across the three
quadrats within the 25-m2 plot, respectively.
Functional traits measurements
We measured (or collected date from literature) 16 key
functional traits on all 17 macrophyte species following
standardized protocols. We sampled a total of 1513

individuals for the measurements on functional traits.
The data of ﬁve functional traits (ﬂoating leaf, perennial,
tuber, mean Julian ﬂowering date, and ﬂowering dura-
tion) were collected from regional ﬂoras.
Mean Julian ﬂowering dates and ﬂowering duration for
each species were determined using regional ﬂoras that
describe the earliest and latest months that a species is in
ﬂower. Information of species showing yes or no for three
ordinal traits (i.e., ﬂoating leaf, perennial growth form,
and tuber) was also obtained from the regional ﬂoras.
We measured the other 11 functional traits on 3–56
robust and healthy individuals of each species. Speciﬁc
leaf area is part of the leaf economic spectrum and closely
correlated with photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen content
per mass, and leaf life span (Reich et al. 1999; Wright
et al. 2004). Leaf dry mass content reﬂects the fundamen-
tal trade-off in investing resources in structural tissues vs.
liquid-phase processes and therefore has been argued to
be the root variable governing correlations among the
traits in the leaf economic spectrum (Reich et al. 1999;
Wright et al. 2004; Messier et al. 2010). Lamina thickness
plays an important role in leaf and plant functioning and
relates to species’ strategies of resources acquisition and
use (Kitajima and Poorter 2010). We collected a fully
formed adult leaf, with no signs of damage or senescence
at peak biomass. Collected leaves were stored in sealed
plastic bags with a moist paper towel and scanned (to
determine area) within 2 h of collection. Lamina thick-
ness (mm) was measured on ﬁve to ten points per leaf-
lets, avoiding the mid-vein. Leaves were then dried at
60°C for 4 days and weighed to determine leaf dry
weight. Individual leaf area was calculated from the leaf
scans using Image-Pro Plus (IPP) 6.0 (Media Cybernetics,
Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Speciﬁc leaf area was calculated
as leaf area (cm2) per unit of leaf dry mass (g), and leaf
dry mass content as the ratio of a leaf dry mass to its
water-saturated mass (gg1).
Leaf carbon [C] and nitrogen [N] were determined on
3–10 individual replicates per species. Samples were oven-
dried at 80°C for 48 h and then ground to <0.5 mm
using a Wiley Mill (Thompson Scientiﬁc, Swedesboro,
NJ). Leaf carbon and nitrogen was analyzed on a Flash
EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer (CE Elantech Inc., Lake-
wood, NJ) at Donghu Experimental Station of Lake Eco-
systems, State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and
Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, China. The leaf
carbon/nitrogen [C/N] ratio was calculated as leaf [C]
divided by leaf [N].
Ramet size (g) was calculated as the total dry weight
(DW) of a single ramet. Shoot height (cm), a trait that
is often allometrically related to overall plant size and
competitive interactions for light (Westoby et al. 2002),
was calculated as the distance from the basal stem to the
top of photosynthetic tissues. Stem dry matter content is
the dry mass-to-fresh mass ratio of twigs expressed as
gg1. Stem diameter (mm) was measured as diameter at
the basal stem (2–6 cm above the roots) using a vernier
caliper, which is expressed as mm. Rooting depth (cm)
was measured as the length of major roots for each spe-
cies with expectation of Ceratophyllum demersum, because
it is a rootless macrophyte species. This trait may be
underestimated for submersed and ﬂoating-leaved macro-
phytes in that systematic sampling error did not allow us
to sample absolutely intact roots of these species.
Diversity and trait metrics
We selected a number of taxonomic and functional diver-
sity indices with which to relate variations in ecosystem
processes. For each plot, species richness, Simpson’s even-
ness, and Simpson’s diversity were calculated as measures
of taxonomic diversity.
CWM trait values were used to describe the functional
composition of each plot (Garnier et al. 2004) and were
calculated as PS
i¼1 PiTi, where Pi is the proportional bio-
mass of ith species in the community, Ti is the trait val-
ues of species i, and S is the number of species. CWM
trait values are a quantitative translation of the biomass
ratio hypothesis (Grime 1998) and calculated as the sum
across all species of the products of each species trait
value and their relative abundance (Garnier et al. 2004).
FD indices based on single and multiple traits were
used in the regression model to predict the community
productivity. Functional trait diversity (FDQ) using Rao’s
quadratic
entropy
(Rao
1982)
was
computed
as
PS
i¼1
PS
j¼1 PiPjDij, where Pi is the proportional biomass
of ith species in the community, Dij is the pair-wise trait
dissimilarity of species i and j, and S is the number of
species. Thus, FDQ is the sum of the dissimilarities among
all possible pairs of species in the trait space weighted by
the product of species relative abundances. FDQ based on
single and multiple traits were calculated, respectively.
We also measured three functional diversity indices
based on multiple traits: functional richness, functional
evenness, and functional divergence (Villeger et al. 2008).
Functional richness quantiﬁes the convex hull volume of
functional space occupied by the community, functional
evenness represents the regularity of the distribution in
abundance in this volume, and functional divergence rep-
resents the divergence in the distribution of the species
traits within the trait volume occupied (Villeger et al.
2008; Spasojevic and Suding 2012). Functional evenness
and functional divergence scale from 0 to 1; a high value
indicates more regularity and more deviation, respectively,
in the distribution of abundance of individuals in this
volume (Villeger et al. 2008).

Statistical analysis
A general linear mixed model was applied to assess the vari-
ations in community productivity, taxonomic diversity,
functional identity (CWM), and functional diversity indices
along the water depth gradient, with sites as random effects.
The explanatory power of different sets of predictor vari-
ables and water depth gradient for variation in community
biomass production was explored in a series of nested mul-
tiple regression model analysis (Roscher et al. 2013): (1)
CWM trait values; (2) FDQ based on single traits; (3) func-
tional diversity based on multiple traits (functional rich-
ness,
functional
evenness,
functional
divergence,
and
RaoQ); and (4) species richness, species evenness, and
Simpson’s diversity. Firstly, we ﬁtted linear regression mod-
els with each single predictor variable to evaluate their sig-
niﬁcance in explaining variation in community biomass.
Secondly, models ﬁtting initially all signiﬁcant variables per
predictor group as ﬁxed effects were simpliﬁed through
backward selection and step-wise exclusion of nonsigniﬁ-
cant variables. Thirdly, the remaining candidate variables
per predictor group were entered in a combined model
including water depth gradient and its interaction with the
predictor variables. The combined model was successively
reduced by eliminating nonsigniﬁcant interaction terms
ﬁrst and nonsigniﬁcant main effects afterward.
Results
Taxonomic diversity along the gradient

phytes, four ﬂoating-leaved macrophytes, and one ﬂoat-
ing

across the water depth gradient in Erhai Lake (Table
S1). The trait values of each species were showed in
Table S1. Standing biomass of macrophyte communities
increased from 310 gDWm2 in the shallow water
(0.5 m) to 2010 gDWm2 in the deep water (2.5 m)
(Fig. 1A).

(Fig. 1A). Species richness ranged from 4 to 12 species
per plot with the median plot containing eight species.
There were signiﬁcant decreases in species richness, spe-
cies evenness, and Simpson’s diversity toward the dee-
per water (Fig. 1B,C and D), where a few dominant
submersed macrophytes represented 60–80% of commu-
nity
biomass. Five perennial submersed macrophytes
including three Potamogetonaceae species (Potamogeton
maackianus, Potamogeton lucens, and Potamogeton malai-
anus) and two Hydrocharitaceae species (Hydrilla verticilla-
ta and Vallisneria natans) dominate across the water depth
gradient, in which they represented >50% of the biomass.
Functional identity and diversity along the
gradient
Community-weighted means (CWM) showed signiﬁcant
decreases along the gradient for stem dry mass content,

Q indices did not change with varying water depths
(Fig. 2B and D).
Predictions of community biomass
The variations in community biomass along the gradient
were signiﬁcantly dependent on CWM traits and single-
trait FDQ. The CWM traits were positively related to
community biomass for ﬂoating leaf, shoot height and
leaf [C/N], and negatively for perennial growth form,
tuber, stem diameter, leaf dry mass content, stem dry
mass content, and leaf [N] (Table 1). Single-trait FDQ
were positively related to community biomass for ﬂoating
leaf, perennial growth form, tuber, mean Julian ﬂowering
date, ramet size, leaf [C] and leaf [N], and negatively for
shoot height and lamina thickness (Table 1). Multiple-
trait FD were positively related to community biomass
only
for
functional
divergence
(R2 = 0.15,
F = 8.48,
P = 0.006). Each individual group of predictor variables
explained a signiﬁcant proportion of total variation in
community biomass (Table 2): CWM (57%), single-trait
FDQ (64%), multiple traits FD (26%), species richness
(4%), water depth gradient (15%). The ﬁnal model com-
bining different groups of predictor variables explained
over 65% of total variation in community biomass pro-
duction (Table 2), in which each group of predictor con-
tributed 61.5% for CWM, 30% for single-trait FDQ, and
2.6% for water depth gradient.
Discussions
In this study, we applied a step-wise modeling procedure
to test the relative effects of taxonomic diversity, functional
identity, and functional diversity on macrophytes commu-
nity productivity along water depth gradient and explore
whether there were signiﬁcant differences among different
functional traits in explaining productivity. Study results
showed that functional trait composition (i.e., functional
identity and functional diversity) provided a more appro-
priate framework for explaining macrophytes community
productivity in comparison with the taxonomic diversity.
CWM exhibited a two times higher explanatory power rel-
ative to FD indices in determining variations in commu-
nity productivity, supporting the mass ratio hypothesis
that it is the traits of the dominant species which largely
contribute to high productivity. Our results are consistent
with previous study indicating a higher explanatory power
of CWM relative to FD indices in determining variations
in community productivity (Dıaz et al. 2007; Roscher et al.
2013). Notably, FD indices also explained remarkable vari-
ations in community productivity, and the combination of
CWM and FD would largely promoted the explanatory
power of regressions models (Flynn et al. 2011; Roscher
et al. 2013). This result suggests the mass ratio hypothesis
(Grime 1998) and niche complementary hypothesis are not
mutually exclusive in explaining the biodiversity–ecosys-
tem functioning relationships.

For nine of sixteen traits, CWM and FDQ showed sig-
niﬁcant
correlations
with
community
productivity,
although the strength and direction of those relations
depended on traits considered. The effects of CWM and
FD on productivity can operate independently on the dif-
ferent traits or simultaneously on the same traits. For
instance, communities with lower trait values of stem
diameter, leaf/stem dry mass content, and leaf [C/N]
showed higher productivity, while those with great even
distributions of mean Julian ﬂowering date, lamina thick-
ness, and leaf [C] also had higher productivity. This ﬁnd-
ing
suggests
that
ecosystem
functioning
may
be
inﬂuenced either by some traits’ values of dominant spe-
cies or by the other traits’ distributions in communities.
In addition, both mean values and spread distribution of
ﬂoating leaf positively affected community productivity.
Our results implied that the variation in community pro-
ductivity may result from either speciﬁc functional com-
ponent in some functional axes or both functional
components
in
other
functional
axes.
For
perennial
growth form, tuber, and leaf [N], however, productivity
decreased with their mean trait values but increased with
their distribution in a community. That is, functional
composition
in
a
community
affected
productivity
through either additive or opposite effects of CWM and
FD, depending on the traits considered. Remarkably, the
negative relationships between functional diversity and
ecosystem processes are impressive but not often reported
by previous studies. This result suggests that the comple-
mentary effects on ecosystem functioning may be greatly
dependent on the particular functional traits (Mokany
et al. 2008). For some functional traits, productivity may
increase with functional diversity; while for other traits,
the higher productivity is largely due to all species pos-
sessing a particular trait value. Overall, after accounting
for all candidate signiﬁcant indicators in the ﬁner model,
FD showed a greatly positive effect on productivity, which
demonstrates that complementary as a mechanism affect-
ing ecosystem functioning may be associating with a
number of trade-offs among different functional niches.
In contrary to the great effects of single-trait FDQ on
productivity, the multiple-traits FD contributed to a very
less variations in community productivity, although the
multi-trait FD indices may reﬂect unique information of
functional composition and predict ecosystem functioning
in certain condition. These results lend further supports

Functional traits composition predict

to the idea that single-trait functional indices outperform
multiple-traits indices in predicting ecosystem functioning
(Butterﬁeld and Suding 2013). The limited predictive
power of multiple-traits FD was largely due to that the
different individual traits were included in a composite
index, which may have irrelevant or opposing effects on
productivity (Table 2). Therefore, the mix of positive,
negative, and independent effects incorporated into calcu-
lations of multiple traits FD likely result in the relative
few inﬂuences on productivity.

explained very little variation in macrophyte community
productivity. The low predictive power of species richness
on productivity was particularly impressive. Most empiri-
cal researches on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning rela-
tionships have focused on species richness as a core in
understanding the number of species in a community may
inﬂuence ecosystem process (Hooper et al. 2005; Maestre
et al. 2012). The observed weak effects of species richness
and evenness on productivity suggest that the number and
abundance of species present in a community may have
little direct impact on ecosystem processes, and those vari-
ations in the functional identity and functional diversity of
the communities will be of far greater importance.
With increasing water depth, we observed a signiﬁcant
decrease in taxonomic diversity, functional identity (i.e.,
CWM of stem dry mass content, leaf [C], and leaf [N]),
and functional diversity (i.e., FDQ of ﬂoating leaf, mean
Julian ﬂowering date, and rooting depth). However, com-
munity productivity tended to increase along water depth
gradient. In present study, the inﬂuences of water depth
on taxonomic diversity and productivity may operate
independently of each other, because there were no signif-
icant relationships between taxonomic diversity and pro-
ductivity. The signiﬁcant negative effects of water depth
on functional compositions were only found on particular
traits, which also showed either irrelevant or negative
inﬂuences on productivity. This result indicates that water
depth may affect ecosystem functioning indirectly through
functional composition. For the multiple-trait FD indices,
functional richness decreased while functional divergence
increased with water depth gradient. Previous studies
have identiﬁed that functional richness is often positively
correlated with species richness (Petchey and Gaston
2006). Similarly, functional richness had no signiﬁcant
effects on productivity. However, functional divergence
showed a positive inﬂuence on productivity, lending fur-
ther supports to the idea that water depth had an indi-
rectly effect on ecosystem functioning.
In conclusion, the variations in functional trait compo-
sition (i.e., CWM and FD) exhibited remarkably great
power in predicting variations in community productivity
along environmental gradients. Functional composition in
a community affected productivity through either additive
or opposite effects of CWM and FD, depending on the
particular traits being considered. Our results suggested
both mechanisms of biomass ratio and niche complemen-
tarity can operate simultaneously on variations in com-
munity productivity, and considering both CWM and FD
would lead to a more profound understanding of traits–
productivity relationships.

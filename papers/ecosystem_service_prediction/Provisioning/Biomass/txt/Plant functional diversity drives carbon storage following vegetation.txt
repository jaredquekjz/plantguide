Ongoing climatic changes induced by human activities increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which
have considerable eﬀects on the structure and function of ecosystems, including carbon (C) storage, plant
functional traits and therefore on a wide set of ecosystem services. Plant functional diversity is beneﬁt to im-
prove plant photosynthesis and enhance C eﬃciency and therefore decrease CO2. Here, the focus of this article is
on integrating of plant functional diversity and C storage, which aims to contribute to C sequestration for climate
change mitigation following vegetation restoration in Loess Plateau, China. Firstly, the CWM (plant community-
weighted mean) traits of the most abundant plant species can account for C storage in AGBC (above-ground
biomass C), ALC (above-ground litter C), STC (soil total carbon) and TEC (total ecosystem carbon). Secondly, the
CWM of plant height and LCC (leaf carbon concentration) had a positive eﬀect C storage in diﬀerent part (AGBC,
ALC, STC and TEC), while the CWM of LNC (leaf nitrogen concentration) and SLA (speciﬁc leaf area) had a
negative eﬀect on C storage in diﬀerent part. Further, the CWM of plant height, LCC, SLA and plant functional
dispersion (FDis) can be used to predict C storage by multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, the positive
association between FDis and C storage was found in SEM, shedding light on the key role of plant functional
diversity driving C storage following vegetation restoration. The ﬁndings presented here highlight the im-
portance of both plant traits of dominant species and plant functional diversity in regulating C storage, and show
that favorable climate conditions, particularly vegetation restoration, tend to increase C storage and plant
functional diversity, which have important implications for improving global C cycling and ecosystem services.
1. Introduction
Ongoing climatic changes induced by large-scale human activities
increases in atmospheric CO2 since the early 19th century and re-
presents one of the biggest scientiﬁc and political challenges of the 21st
century (Nolan et al., 2018; De Nijs et al., 2019). At present, China has
the largest annual CO2 emissions in the world, and reducing CO2
emissions to mitigate regional and global climate change is one of the
most challenging issues facing humanity (Fang et al., 2018; Chen et al.,
2019). As a consequence, increasing in atmospheric CO2 have con-
siderable eﬀects on the structure and function of ecosystems, including
C storage, plant functional traits and therefore on a wide set of eco-
system services (Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). So plant functional
traits are beneﬁt to improve plant photosynthesis and enhance C eﬃ-
ciency and therefore mitigate the increasing in atmospheric CO2.
Currently, we know little about how plant functional traits drive C
storage (plant C, soil C, and the whole ecosystem C storage) (Kunstler
et al., 2015; Anne et al., 2018). Growing evidence have shown that
plant functional traits strongly aﬀected plant growth, species richness,
biomass and C storage (Pietsch et al., 2014; Moreau et al., 2015; Fang
et al., 2018), and there was the evolutionary trade-oﬀs between C ac-
quisition and decomposition (Gardarin et al., 2014; Moreau et al.,
2015). For example, acquisitive resource use syndromes are char-
acterized by the combination of attributes such as high SLA (speciﬁc
leaf area), high LNC (leaf nitrogen concentration), and low LDMC (leaf
dry matter content) (Ruiz-Benito et al., 2014; Moreau et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2018). They are consistently associated with high C input through
photosynthesis and also high C losses through decomposition (Dı́az and
Cabido, 2001; Elmqvist et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).
On the other hand, plants traits associated with the large plant biomass,
plant height and LDMC, are therefore expected to directly inﬂuence C
storage in above-ground and below-ground (Mokany et al., 2008;

Schmidt et al., 2011; Zuppinger-Dingley et al., 2014). Plant functional
diversity, the extent of functional diﬀerences among plant species, is
one of the most important plant trait that closely linked to C cycling
(Tilman et al., 1997; Petchey and Gaston, 2002; He et al., 2017; Xu
et al., 2018). Large numbers of evidence conformed that plant func-
tional diversity can be regarded as the main indicator for forecasting C
storage (Chen et al., 2014; Handa et al., 2014; Smiseth et al., 2014). In
this case, the abundant plant CWMs (community weighted mean) pri-
marily supported to the biomass ratio hypothesis (Grime, 1998), which
proposed that ecosystem function and C storage were mainly driven by
the abundant of plant CWMs (Cong et al., 2015; Fatichi et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2015; Latz et al., 2016). Thus, the abundant of plant CWMs
have been proven to be the dominant factors in determining ecosystem
function and C storage. Meanwhile, multi-traits of functional dispersion
(FDis), weighted by plant relative abundances, could also enhance
ecosystem function and C storage (Zuo et al., 2016a; Zuo et al., 2016b;
Fang et al., 2018). Previous studies have reported that FDis had a po-
sitive eﬀect on ecosystem function and C storage in order to get the
more resource niches, supporting the niche-complementarity hypoth-
esis (Flynn et al., 2011; Gardarin et al., 2014; Harrison et al., 2018). For

example, the higher FDis with the diverging values of resource niches,
would lead to an increase in niche-complementarity, and then resulting
in the higher biomass and C storage. As expected, more evidence de-
monstrated that niche-complementarity hypotheses and biomass ratio
co-regulated ecosystem function and C storage, while they are not ne-
cessarily mutually exclusive (Conti and Díaz, 2013; Bragina et al., 2013;
Wu et al., 2016).
The Loess Plateau of China is one of the most eroded areas and
deepest loess deposits in the world (Fu et al., 2017). To reduce soil
water and C loss, soil erosion, the Chinese Government launched a
series of remarkable programs in the 1980s (Chen et al., 2015; Feng
et al., 2016). Thereafter, the Grain-for-Green program largely con-
tribute to maintaining soil conservation, improving C sequestration
since 1999 (Fu et al., 2011). Indeed, a large area of abandoned farm-
land has been converted to a natural grass-land/shrub-land (natural
restoration) or artiﬁcial forest (artiﬁcial restoration). Subsequently,
natural restoration and artiﬁcial restoration became the two most
successful ecological restoration methods (Li et al., 2017; Tong et al.,
2018). In fact, artiﬁcial restoration has been regarded as an eﬀective
measure for promoting ecosystem restoration by mitigating CO2 con-
centrations in the atmosphere (Li et al., 2017; Nave et al., 2018), ac-
celerating soil C sequestration and leading to the increase of soil C
storage (Li et al., 2012; Lange et al., 2015; Lal, 2018). In contrast to
artiﬁcial restoration, natural restoration promotes the ecosystem bio-
geochemical cycles (particularly soil microbial community activity) by
a natural enclosure process (Li et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2018). Most
importantly, both of artiﬁcial restoration and natural restoration can
increase C storage by present studies. For instance, Yang et al. (2018)
declared that soil C storage had a strong increase due to vegetation
restoration. Similarly, soil nutrients (Zhang et al., 2016) or the other
environmental variables make a large contribution to C storage (Karhu
et al., 2014; Laforestlapointe et al., 2017; Geml and Wagner, 2018;
Tripathi et al., 2018). Whereas, how plant functional diversity changed
following vegetation restoration, and the relative contribution of plant
functional diversity to C storage still largely unknown in this region.
Plant functional diversity is beneﬁt to improve plant photosynthesis
and enhance C eﬃciency and therefore decrease CO2. Estimates plant
functional diversity following vegetation restoration are critical to
predicting future ecosystem C sequestration under global change. Here,
the focus of this article is on integrating of plant functional diversity
and C storage, which aims to contribute to C sequestration for climate
change mitigation following vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau,
China. Thus, we quantiﬁed FDis and CWMs and sought to disentangle
how plant functional diversity drives C storage (i.e., STC, the soil total
carbon; AGBC, the above-ground biomass carbon; ALC, the above-litter
carbon; TEC, the total ecosystem carbon) following vegetation re-
storation in the Loess Plateau. Three questions addressed: (1) How do
dominant abundant plant species, plant functional diversity and C
storage change following vegetation restoration? and (2) How do plant
functional diversity drive C storage following vegetation restoration? If
it doing so, we hypothesized that (i) Plant functional diversity aﬀects C
storage through the dominant plant functional traits; (ii) C storage in
diﬀerent part could be predicted by FDis or CWMs, based on biomass
ratio hypothesis; (iii) C storage in diﬀerent part are positively asso-
ciated with FDis, according to niche-complementarity hypothesis.
2. Methods
2.1. Sampling areas
This study was carried out in northern of Shannxi province of the
Loess Plateau, located in Zhifanggou (Fig. 1). The studied area has a
semi-arid climate, and hills with steep slopes (more than 40%) and cliﬀs
cover 90% of the region with a heavy periodic ﬂooding and seasonal
rainfall with the loessal soil. The rainy season is from June to Sep-
tember, while August occupied more than 20% of the total rainfall. The
average annual temperature is from 5 to 9 °C, and the average annual
rainfall was approximately 497 mm during two decades.
2.2. Experimental design
Five vegetation types were investigated: Af (artiﬁcial forest, Robinia
pseudoacacia), Ag (artiﬁcial grassland, Sophora viciifolia), Ng (natural
grassland, Stipa bungeana), Ns (natural shrub, Sophora davidii), Al
(abandoned land, Medicago sativa). These vegetation types changed by
diﬀerent land-use regimes, including diﬀerent intensities of extensive
grazing and excess reclamation. Despite diﬀerences in the historic dis-
turbance regime, currently there was the same soil type among these
land use types. We set three replicate plots for each land use type
(100 × 100 m) for a total of 45 plots. Each plots were at a distance of
1 km apart, and three replicate sub-plots of 15 × 15 m, 5 × 5 m, and
1 × 1 m were selected for forestland, shrub land, grassland in Sep.
2016. We established ﬁve replicate sub-plots in the forest to quantify C
in woody, litter and soil at a depth of 100 cm (0–20, 20–40, 40–60,
60–80, 80–100 cm). Speciﬁcally, we measured more than 580 trees
across
the
site,
and
we
calculated
diameter
at
breast
height
(DBH, > 5 cm diameter) and plant height, then estimated above-ground
dry biomass by the allometric model in the following formula (Walker
et al., 1999):
AGB = exp [-0.548 + lg(BA)].
(1)
BA means the basal area (cm2), which was calculated by π*(DBH/
2)2, DBH means the diameter at the breast height (cm).
We established ﬁve replicate plots (5 × 5 m) to estimate the shrub
biomass. more than 870 shrubs were measured across the site, and then
calculated the individual shrub above-ground dry biomass (AGB) ac-
cording to a general model as following (Jackson et al., 2002):
AGB = 1.23×exp (−8.37 + In(CA)).
(2)
CA means the crown area (cm2), deﬁned as the circle, and calcu-
lated by the projection diameter. We converted AGB to above-ground
biomass C (AGBC) by multiplying 0.5, since C always represents ap-
proximately 50% of the dry biomass.
In addition, we harvested all above-ground biomass and litters from
ﬁve plots (1 × 1 m) to obtain the dry biomass, which was collected
from the ground surface. The above-ground biomass and litters were
oven-dried at 80 °C until the constant weight (about 36 h) and then
weighed. Besides, the dead above-ground biomass were also sampled
but not considered in the ﬁnal calculations. Calculations indicated that
the dead biomass represented only 0.1% of the total biomass, which
was unlikely to aﬀect the results. In addition, we investigated plant
coverage, plant height and the number of species in each site, and the
vegetation characteristics, the land-use regimes following vegetation
restoration are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
2.3. C storage
The total herbaceous and woody vegetation represented the above-
ground biomass C (AGBC, g·m−2). The total litter (i.e., the leaf litter and
woody debris) represented the above-ground litter C (ALC, g·m−2), and
we measured the C content of each plant species. The total soil C sto-
rage (divided into ﬁve depths, 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80 and
80–100 cm) was quantiﬁed by collecting soil from 0 to 100 cm (STC,
g·m−2). STC was calculated (Deng et al., 2014):
STC=SOC×BD×D/10
(3)
SOC means soil organic carbon (g·kg−1), BD means soil bulk density
(g·cm−3), D means soil thickness (cm).
Soil samples were collected along an S-shaped curve by a soil corer
10 cm in diameter in each site, air-dried for 20 d, and sieved through a
0.15-mm mesh. SOC was measured by the oxidation method in

K2Cr2O7–H2SO4.
TEC = ALC+AGBC+STC
(4)
TEC means the total ecosystem C.
Meanwhile, latitude, longitude and altitude was determined using
Global Position System (GPS).
2.4. Plant functional traits and diversity
To calculate plant trait values across all plots, 42 types of dominant
species (a total of 57 species) were collected, since they could account
for more than 90% of the total biomass and at least 75% of the total
plant coverage. All the plant samples was conducted between 7:30–9:30
a.m. to reduce relative error. Because of variation due to diﬀerent po-
sitions, the leaves were collected from diﬀerent azimuths without the
petiole, and at least six replicates with diﬀerent maturity and healthy
individuals were collected in each plot. The plant functional traits of
these dominant plant species presented in Supplementary Table 2.
Generally, LCC, LNC and SLA, are the key traits in the ‘leaf eco-
nomics spectrum’. LDMC and plant height are trade-oﬀto plant life
history strategy and strong related to plant growth. Thus, we selected
ﬁve key functional traits (i.e., plant height, the LCC, LNC, SLA and
LDMC) that are known or expected to aﬀect the C dynamics and storage
(Shipley et al., 2006; Santiago, 2007). The measurements of plant
functional traits with the standard method in Supplementary Table 3.
We calculated the dominant trait values by using by the average
trait value, and then get the community weighted mean (CWM)
(Villéger et al., 2008). The variety of an individual trait value re-
presents the variance of a trait value, and FDvar (functional trait dis-
persion index) weighted by each plant species' abundance (Mason et al.,
2003):

CWM (traitx) refers to the community weighted mean for x trait, pi
refers to the relative richness of species i, and xi refers to the trait value
for the species i, V is plant volume of the species i.
In addition, we calculated FDis (the functional dispersion) ac-
cording to multiple traits, which reﬂects species divergence in distance,
weighted by the multi-trait functional space. In this way, FDis should be
closely related to complementarity eﬀects range between 0 and 1.
2.5. Data analysis
All the data analyses were done in Excel 2010 and SAS 9.4 software
for windows (SAS Inc., Chicago, IL). Before parametric tests, we tested
for the homogeneity of variance. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
multiple comparisons were used to determine the least signiﬁcant dif-
ference by Tukey's test. For all data tests, statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ferences were assigned at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. The statistical
package FDi-versity v. 2011 was used to calculate all the functional
diversity indices.
Firstly, we used the linear regression analysis to disentangle asso-
ciation between C storage and plant functional diversity. Given the
strong correlations between several driving factors, we conducted a
principal component analysis (PCA) of the standardized values of those
parameters to identify the primary axes of covariation among the
driving factors. Then, we used a Monte Carlo permutation test to de-
termine the signiﬁcance of PCA eﬀects. Secondly, we selected the best

predictors for explaining C storage in diﬀerent part by the stepwise
regression. Finally, structural equation modeling (SEM) was con-
structed, and the path coeﬃcients were calculated after 999 bootstraps
in AMOS (version 20.0). In SEM, we selected the speciﬁc variables that
depend on the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA,
p < 0.05) and Akaike information criterion (AIC); then, we obtained
the indirect and direct eﬀects from the interaction pathways. Finally,
we assessed the ﬁtting goodness using the chi-squared tests (χ2).
3. Results
3.1. C storage and plant function diversity following vegetation restoration
In this study, C storage in artiﬁcial forest (Af) and natural shrubs
(Ns) followed the order TEC > AGBC > STC > ALC, with the lowest C
storage in litter, whereas C storage in artiﬁcial grassland (Ag) followed
the order TEC > STC > ALC > AGBC (Fig. 2). Compared with aban-
doned land (Al), the average total ecosystem C storage of Af, Ns, Ag and
Ng increased 16.79, 11.54, 1.20, and 3.86 times, respectively. More-
over, C storage in litter was higher than in aboveground biomass in Ag
(as shown in Fig. 2), litter C in Ng was substantially higher than other
land use types. These ﬁndings suggested that vegetation restoration
(artiﬁcial and natural vegetation restoration) could increase C storage
in diﬀerent ecosystem components. In addition, the mainly C storage in
Af, Ng, Ns stored in above ground, whereas the mainly C storage in Ag
stored in litter. Besides, soil C storage in Al was 14.2–15.3 g m−2 at
0–20 cm and 10.4–10.7 g m−2 at 80–100 cm, and no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in Al and Ag (p > 0.05). Soil C storage in Ng and Ns were ap-
proximately 105.4–143.0 g m−1 at 0–100 cm, and higher than the other
vegetation types (p > 0.05). As for AGBC, Ns was higher among land
use types. TEC in Af, Ns, Ag and Ng were higher than Al and followed
Af > Ns > Ng > Ag > Al. TEC in Ng was roughly half as much for the
other land use types. These results provided a comprehensive com-
parison for C storage. Besides, a similar vertical distribution of STC
(gradually deceased with soil depth) was found following vegetation
restoration.
As a component of plant diversity, FDis provides an eﬀective
method to study plant species distribution in niche space and resources,
which has attracted a great deal of attention. We found that C storage is
closely related to vegetation restoration (Fig. 3). Compared to Al, there
was an increase in plant height regardless of vegetation types (Table 1).
Both of LDMC and SLA in Ag were lower, and LCC in Af and Ns were
higher among land use types. LNC in Ns and Ag were higher than Af, Ng
and Al. FDis of SLA and LNC showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among
vegetation types (p > 0.05). FDis of LDMC in Ag and Al were sig-
niﬁcantly lower, and FDis of LCC in Ns was signiﬁcantly higher among
vegetation types (p < 0.05). Besides, FDis in Al was signiﬁcantly lower
among vegetation types (p < 0.05).

under the dissimilarity value.

3.2. Correlation analysis between C storage and functional diversity
We examined the correlation between functional diversity and C
storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments. Not unexpectedly, func-
tional diversity was signiﬁcantly related to C storage in diﬀerent part
(Supplementary Table 4). Speciﬁcally, the CWM of LCC and plant
height were positively related to AGBC, ALC, STC and TEC (p < 0.01),
while the CWM of LNC was negatively related to AGBC, ALC, STC and
TEC (p < 0.01). The CWM of SLA and LDMC were positively related to
TEC (p < 0.01). Besides, FDis was positively related to AGBC, ALC,
STC and TEC (p < 0.01). Not unexpectedly, plant functional diversity
was positively related to C storage in diﬀerent part. As a consequence,

individual plant traits would be more appropriate to explain C storage
according to linear regression models (Fig. 4). Among these plant
functional traits, the CWM of plant height, SLA, LCC, LNC, and LDMC
explained more variation for C storage in diﬀerent part. Speciﬁcally, the
CWM of plant height could positively predict C storage except for STC.
The CWM of SLA and LDMC positively predicted C storage in AGBC,
ALC and TEC but not well explained C storage in STC. In addition, the
CWM of LCC positively predicted C storage in diﬀerent part, and the
CWM of LNC had no signiﬁcant relationship with C storage (p > 0.05).
In total, all the plant functional diversity could explain C storage
well in the diﬀerent part, only the single-trait indices explained C sto-
rage well in the ﬁnal models (Table 3). Speciﬁcally, AGBC was posi-
tively predicted by the CWM of plant height and LCC. ALC was best
predicted by FDis and the CWM of plant height. STC was positively
predicted by the CWM of SLA and plant height. Finally, TEC was ne-
gatively predicted by FDis and the CWM of LDMC and plant height.
3.3. Plant functional diversity drives C storage following vegetation
restoration
A principal component analysis (PCA) of plant functional traits were
used to identify the correlations between C storage and functional di-
versity components (Fig. 5A). PCA axis 1 primarily reﬂected plant
height, LDMC, LCC, which accounted for 49.13% of the overall var-
iance; axis 2 mainly reﬂected SLA, explaining 34.78% of the standar-
dized variance, Suggesting that plant height, LDMC, LCC were posi-
tively
correlated
with C storage,
while LNC
and SLA
had
no
signiﬁcantly diﬀerence (p > 0.05). In addition, Partial correlations
between the magnitude of C storage and functional diversity compo-
nents was also similar to PCA analysis (Table 2).
Based on theses above analyses, structural equation models (SEM)
was built to summarize the pathways of the interactions between plant
functional diversity and C storage (F=236.14, p=0.537, df = 27,
χ2 = 6.52, GFI = 0.953, AIC = 156.31, RSMEA = 0.001) (Fig. 5B,
Supplementary Table 5), and we tested for the possible inﬂuence in a
priori structural equation model (Supplementary Fig. 1). The variation
of all of the explanatory factors was 75.04%, indicating that this model
could explain C storage well (p < 0.01). In the ﬁnal SEM, FDis was
negatively related to the CWM of LNC and SLA, however, the CWM of
SLA and LNC was negatively related to AGBC, ALC and TEC with the
higher standard coeﬃcient. Similarly, the CWM of plant height and
LCC, which showed a positive association with FDis, were regarded as
the main predictors for C storage, suggesting that both the mass ratio
hypothesis and the niche complementarity hypothesis were not mu-
tually exclusive, they explain C storage in the ecosystem compartments
together, which were agreement with the results from linear regression
analyses. Further, SEM would provide a new insight to the underlying
ecological relationships between FDis and C storage in the ecosystem
compartments, such as, FDis increased with the increased species
richness following vegetation restoration, supporting the evidence that
the more rich species in ecosystem had the more C storage. This is re-
lated to that the richness species enhanced above-ground biomass, and
then resulted in a higher C storage. In total, increased CWMs of plant
trait was not associated with species richness but with C storage in
diﬀerent ecosystem compartments.
4. Discussion
4.1. C storage and plant function diversity following vegetation restoration
C sequestration plays an important role in mitigating anthropogenic
increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Compelling evidence
indicates that large amounts of C have been lost because of the eﬀects of
climate change and human disturbance (Nolan et al., 2018; De Nijs
et al., 2019). Specially, previous studies have suggested that the in-
creased C storage in Asian terrestrial ecosystems can primarily be at-
tributed to considerable aﬀorestation and reforestation, especially
China's vegetation restoration project (Chen et al., 2015; Feng et al.,
2016). Recently, NASAEarth satellites showed that Earth has grown
markedly greener since the turn of the millennium, and human activity
in China and India dominate the greening of our planet, thanks to forest
conservation and tree planting, as well as intense crop cultivation (Chen
et al., 2019). Here, this study is focus on integrating the possible me-
chanisms that plant functional diversity explaining C storage, and also
test the links between plant functional diversity and C storage in the
Loess Plateau. Here, three aspects of our study distinguished from
previous studies. First, unlike few studies of the eﬀect of plant func-
tional diversity on C storage, our study not only clariﬁed the changes of
C storage and plant functional diversity in terms of vegetation re-
storation, but also examined the relationships between plant functional
diversity and C storage. Second, our study was conducted in the Loess
Plateau, which has the world's highest rate of C erosion and faces severe
C loss (Fu et al., 2017). It represents a rare exploration of an ecologi-
cally important but vulnerable area in the world, and we focused on
deciphering association between C storage and plant functional di-
versity following vegetation restoration. The third and most important,
our study demonstrated the positive association between plant func-
tional diversity and C storage, providing an evidence that there were
strong links between plant functional diversity and C storage regardless
of vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau.
We found that vegetation restoration (artiﬁcial and natural re-
storation) had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on C storage (Fig. 2). STC was sig-
niﬁcantly higher in natural restoration (natural grassland, natural
shrub) than in artiﬁcial restoration (artiﬁcial grassland, artiﬁcial
forest), while AGBC was signiﬁcantly greater in artiﬁcial restoration
(artiﬁcial forest) than in natural restoration (natural grassland, natural
shrub). The ﬁndings revealed that STC increased following vegetation
restoration. The possible reason maybe that vegetation restoration
(Robinia pseudoacacia and Sophora davidii) were dominated by Legumi-
nosae plants in this region, which are beneﬁcial to accumulate more

nitrogen (N) by N-ﬁxing microorganisms, and then promote an increase
in C storage (An et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2014). In particular, STC was
higher in natural restoration (Ns, Ng), and AGBC was more higher
compared to abandoned land (Al). Further, there was a large AGBC and
TEC due to the large above-ground biomass, leading to more C storage.
As for Al, a lower C input and higher C mineralization resulted in less C
storage, because conventional tillage was still used in this area, which
induced large C losses (Beare et al., 1994; Skjemstad et al., 2008).
Overall, the ﬁndings conﬁrmed the fact that C storage has been in-
creased due to vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau.
Moreover, the ﬁndings of the higher C storage in the surface soil
layer do agree with the results from An (An et al., 2013), Wang (Fu
et al., 2011), Deng (Deng et al., 2014), Fang (Fang et al., 2018) and Liu
(Liu et al., 2018), because of the higher C input in the surface litters.
However, this ﬁndings were not in agreement with the study of Fu (Fu
et al., 2011) and Liu (Liu et al., 2018), who reported that soil C storage
in artiﬁcial grassland (Ag) was slightly less than in abandoned land, nor
did they agree with the results of Chen (Chen et al., 2015) and Tang
(Tang et al., 2018), who reported that soil C storage in artiﬁcial
grassland was signiﬁcantly higher in the top soil (0–20 cm). This is
related to the management and regimes from government in land use
types. Artiﬁcial grassland was mowed several times to feed cattle or
sheep in this region, leading to a reduction in C storage, while artiﬁcial
forest was usually managed with no application of chemical or organic
fertilizer, resulting in the large plant biomass and C storage (Wang
et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015). Overall, conversion of
the vegetation types in this region, i.e., vegetation restoration, could
increase C storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments. Interestingly,
the plant functional traits showed the similar variation trend with the C
storage (Table 1), suggesting a strong links between plant functional
traits and C storage.
4.2. Plant functional diversity drives C storage following vegetation
restoration
The present study had shown how plant functional diversity ex-
plained ecosystem C storage in terms of vegetation restoration in the
Loess Plateau, which could be extensively discussed in the role of plant
functional diversity eﬀects on ecosystem function. Specially, we found
that C storage is closely related to vegetation restoration (Fig. 3) and
apparently linked to plant functional diversity (Table 2; Fig. 4), sup-
porting our ﬁrst hypothesis that plant functional diversity aﬀects C

storage through the dominant plant functional traits. Further, a strong
relationship between C storage and plant functional diversity was found
in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments (Fig. 4). This result indicates that
plant functional diversity represents the abiotic variables and in-
dependently explains C storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments.
Speciﬁcally, the CWM of plant height was signiﬁcantly and positively
correlated with ALC, AGBC, STC and TEC (p < 0.01), which explained
C storage in regression analyses. Not surprisingly, the CWM of plant
height was an important factor in explaining C storage. This can be
explained by that the higher abundant species can increase plant bio-
mass due to vegetation restoration, thus contributing to the higher C
storage, and supporting the ﬁrst hypotheses that the trait values of the
dominant abundant species could predict C storage in diﬀerent eco-
system compartments (Wright et al., 2006; Weng et al., 2014; Xiao
et al., 2014; Kammann et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2015). Besides, the CWM
of plant traits (plant height, LCC) were signiﬁcantly and correlated to C
storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments, supporting our second
hypothesis that C storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments could be
predicted by CWMs in accordance with the biomass ratio hypotheses.
Most importantly, the positive association between C storage and plant
functional diversity were found, providing an evidence that strong links
between C storage and plant functional diversity regardless of vegeta-
tion restoration in the Loess Plateau.
In addition, PCA was used to identify the correlations between C
storage and plant functional diversity (Fig. 5A), and we found that FDis
was positively related to C storage in structural equation model (SEM)
(Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table 5). This result partly supported the third
hypothesis that a higher FDis was associated with greater C storage,
suggesting that FDis has an important role in explaining C storage. This
result is also consistent with other ﬁndings because diﬀerent plant
species can use C in a complementary manner (Cornelissen and
Cornwell, 2014; Prentice et al., 2014). On the one hand, dominant plant
species increase the above-ground biomass, which is known as the
“selection eﬀect” due to vegetation restoration. On the other hand, this
is related to the “niche-complementarity eﬀect”—at a higher diversity,
a greater range of plant functional diversity will be represented, pro-
viding opportunities for more eﬃcient use of C resources (Fierer et al.,
2005; Manzoni et al., 2011; McCormack et al., 2015). Following
changes in dominant species and richness in vegetation restoration, C
storage were mainly governed by litter quality, and the above- and
under-ground biomass (Thakur et al., 2015; Freschet et al., 2015).
Therefore, the links between the plant functional diversity and C sto-
rage may primarily be explained either by the biomass ratio hypothesis
or the niche-complementarity model (Cornelissen and Cornwell, 2014;
Prentice et al., 2014). This result supported the ﬁndings that the mass
ratio and niche-complementarity hypotheses in combination explain C
storage. Besides, FDis was negatively related to the CWM of plant traits,
and C storage was negatively related to the CWM of SLA and LNC with a
higher standard coeﬃcient (Table 3). Similarly, the CWM of plant
height and LCC, which showed a positive association with FDis, were
regarded as signiﬁcant predictors for C storage. Giving the reason that
plant height and LCC would improve microclimatic factors, such as soil
temperature, humidity and natural resources, so plant height largely
determines C storage. Therefore, we can get the conclusion that the
FDis and CWM traits, together explained C storage, supporting most of
previous studies (Walker et al., 1999; Berg and Meentemeyer, 2002;
Murphy et al., 1998). These ﬁndings supported some previous results
that FDis and CWM traits can explain C storage reported by Zuo (Zuo
et al., 2016a) in Horqin sandy and Conti and Díaz (2013) in semi-arid
forest ecosystems. These ﬁndings have important implications for im-
proving global C cycling and ecosystem services. Although our results
demonstrated that the major plant functional diversity-dominant trait
values are the main drivers for C storage in Loess Plateau, the other
environmental drivers (such as the climate factors, land use types,
human management, temperature, precipitation and so on) aﬀecting C
storage should be considered in further study.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we found the strong positive eﬀect of plant functional
diversity on C storage, by increasing plant functional diversity, may
enhance C storage, indicating that vegetation restoration contribute to
plant functional diversity and C storage in the Loess Plateau, and the
prevalence of particular trait combinations may also increase C storage.
These results imply that increasing C storage can be better achieved by
managing the functional composition of restored communities. So the
implementation of vegetation restoration could be a quantitatively
important strategy, and thus should be continually paid a great atten-
tion.
6. Practical implications
Our study highlights the importance of both plant traits of dominant
species and plant functional diversity in regulating C storage in the
Loess Plateau. The current vegetation restoration can be greatly im-
proved by incorporating plant functional diversity into C storage in the
future, providing some guidance for management for C storage in terms
of vegetation restoration. Thus, maintaining high levels of plant func-
tional diversity can help sustain the beneﬁts of C storage and ecosystem
services in the Loess Plateau.

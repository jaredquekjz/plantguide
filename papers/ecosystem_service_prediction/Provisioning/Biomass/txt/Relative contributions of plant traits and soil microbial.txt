Summary
1. Plant functional diversity and soil microbial community composition are tightly coupled. Changes
in these interactions may inﬂuence ecosystem functioning. Links between plant functional diversity,
soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning have been demonstrated in experiments using
plant monocultures and mixtures, using broad plant and microbial functional groups, but have not
been examined in diverse natural plant communities.
2. We quantiﬁed the relative effects of plant and microbial functional properties on key ecosystem
functions. We measured plant functional diversity, soil microbial community composition and
parameters associated with nitrogen (N) cycling and key nutrient cycling processes at three grassland
sites in different parts of Europe. Because plant structure and function strongly inﬂuence soil micro-
bial communities, we determined relationships between ecosystem properties, plant traits and soil
community characteristics following a sequential approach in which plant traits were ﬁtted ﬁrst,
followed by the additional effects of soil micro-organisms.
3. We identiﬁed a continuum from standing green biomass and standing litter, linked mostly with
plant traits, to potential N mineralization and potential leaching of soil inorganic N, linked mostly
with microbial properties. Plant and microbial functional parameters were equally important in
explaining % organic matter content in soil. A parallel continuum ran from plant height, linked with
above-ground biomass, to plant quality effects captured by the leaf economics spectrum, which were
linked with the recycling of carbon (C) and N.
4. More exploitative species (higher speciﬁc leaf area, leaf N concentrations and lower leaf dry mat-
ter content) and taller swards, along with soil microbial communities dominated by bacteria, with
rapid microbial activities, were linked with greater fodder production, but poor C and N retention.
Conversely, dominance by conservative species (with opposite traits) and soil microbial communities
dominated by fungi, and bacteria with slow activities, were usually linked with low production, but
greater soil C storage and N retention.
5. Synthesis – Grassland production, C sequestration and soil N retention are jointly related to plant
and microbial functional traits. Managing grasslands for selected, or multiple, ecosystem services
will thus require a consideration of the joint effects of plant and soil communities. Further under-
standing of the mechanisms that link plant and microbial functional traits is essential to achieve this.

Introduction
The hypothesis that plant traits responding to resource and
disturbance gradients, especially those describing plant nutri-
ent economics (sensu Freschet et al. 2010) and size, can be
used as predictors of ecosystem functioning (Lavorel &
Garnier 2002) has been supported by an increasing number of
studies
(e.g.
Minden
&
Kleyer
2011;
Pakeman
2011;
Laliberté & Tylianakis 2012; Lavorel & Grigulis 2012).
However, in accordance with theoretical developments on
trait–function relationships (Chapin 1993; Reich, Walters &
Ellsworth 1997; Garnier & Navas 2012), the majority of
quantitative assessments of plant trait effects on ecosystem
functioning have focused on above-ground primary producti-
vity and decomposition and do not address how plant traits
may inﬂuence carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling through
their impacts on soil communities (Eviner & Chapin 2003).
Such a ‘black box’ approach to ecosystem functioning
ignores growing evidence that links between plants and soil
microbial communities can act as drivers for a wide range of
community properties and ecosystem processes (van der Heij-
den, Bardgett & Straalen 2008; Bardgett & Wardle 2010;
Bever et al. 2010). It is now well established that individual
plant species (Grayston et al. 1998; Wardle et al. 2003;
Harrison & Bardgett 2010), and even different genotypes
(Schweitzer et al. 2008; Weinert et al. 2010), can inﬂuence
the diversity and activity of microbial communities in soil.
Such impacts have been attributed to differences in the amount
and quality of resources entering the below-ground compart-
ment in the form of litter and root exudates (Bardgett &
Wardle 2010). At the plant community level, it is also evident
that changes in plant diversity and community structure can
have a cascade effect on soil micro-organisms and their func-
tioning, again through altering the amount and quality of
resources entering the soil (e.g. Hedlund et al. 2003; De Deyn
et al. 2004; Eisenhauer et al. 2010; De Deyn, Quirk & Bardgett
2011a). In turn, this can have consequences for ecosystem
services, such as carbon storage and retention of nutrients in
soil (e.g. Spehn et al. 2005; Fornara & Tilman 2008; Steinbeiss
et al. 2008; De Deyn et al. 2009). However, our understanding
of how plant traits inﬂuence C and N cycling through their
impacts on soil microbial communities remains limited.
To bridge this gap in understanding, an increasing number
of studies have sought to quantify the relationship between
plant functional traits, soil microbial communities and the
functions that they catalyse (De Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett
2008; Bardgett & Wardle 2010). For example, studies in tem-
perate grasslands have shown that landscape-scale variation in
soil microbial community composition can be explained by
certain plant traits, along with other climatic and soil factors
(De Vries et al. 2012), and that concomitant variations in leaf
economics traits and the relative abundance of fungi and soil
bacteria (F : B ratio) are associated with biomass quality and
turnover (Pakeman 2011). Moreover, certain root traits have
been shown to be strongly correlated with the F : B ratio, as
well as the cycling of C (Klumpp et al. 2009) and soil nutri-
ents (Orwin et al. 2010). Also, Laughlin (2011) demonstrated
that in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest, understorey
leaf economics traits contributed to explaining nitriﬁcation
potential through litter quality. Despite this growing under-
standing, most detailed studies that have explored the way in
which plant traits inﬂuence below-ground communities, and
their effects on C and N cycling, have been performed at an
individual plant species or functional group level (e.g. Wardle
et al. 1998; Orwin et al. 2010; but see Laughlin 2011). As a
result, our understanding of how changes in plant traits
impact upon soil microbial communities and ecosystem func-
tioning in natural communities is limited. Moreover, the rela-
tive importance of plant traits and soil microbial properties as
drivers of ecosystem processes, both above- and below-
ground, has not been quantiﬁed. Eviner & Chapin (2003)
proposed that simple plant traits are likely to be poor predic-
tors of ecosystem functions involving soil processes; this is
because of the involvement of soil organisms in these pro-
cesses, which not only affect biogeochemical cycling directly,
but also respond to plant traits (Lavorel et al. 2009). How-
ever, this idea has not yet been tested due to the paucity of
trait-based studies which have addressed speciﬁc below-
ground properties relevant to C and nutrient cycling (Garnier
et al. 2004; Klumpp & Soussana 2009; Lavorel et al. 2011;
Laliberté & Tylianakis 2012; Lienin & Kleyer 2012).
In this study, we quantiﬁed, for the ﬁrst time in the ﬁeld,
the relative contributions of plant and microbial properties,
including measures of the abundance and activity of the
microbial community and speciﬁc microbial functional groups
related to N cycling, to a range of above-ground and below-
ground ecosystem processes. We hypothesized that (i) above-
ground plant traits have stronger effects on above-ground
ecosystem processes in comparison with below-ground ecosys-
tem processes and (ii) nutrient retention is more closely related
to certain microbial properties than to plant traits. At each of
three grassland sites located in the French and Austrian Alps,
and in northern England, each with a range of grassland
management systems representative of that area, we quantiﬁed
(i) plant community composition and functional traits; (ii) soil
properties, including microbial community composition and
function in relation to N cycling, and (iii) key ecosystem
properties
related
to
the
C
and
N
cycles,
including
above-ground biomass, standing litter, soil % organic matter,
potential N mineralization (PNM) and potential leaching of
inorganic N from soil. We determined the relative effects of
plant traits and microbial properties on these ecosystem proper-

ties by analysing, sequentially, direct effects of plant traits and
then additional effects of soil micro-organisms.
Materials and methods
STUDY SITES
Grasslands were selected at three long-term research sites in the
Austrian Tyrol (‘Stubai’ henceforth; two grasslands; Schmitt et al.
2010),
northern
England
(‘Yorkshire
Dales’
henceforth;
three
grasslands; De Deyn et al. 2011b) and the French Alps (‘Lautaret’
henceforth; three grasslands; Lavorel et al. 2011), which represented
a range of climatic, geomorphological and land-use conditions typical
of western European temperate mountains. Within each site, individ-
ual grasslands (c. 1000 m2 each) were representative of current
management trends, including abandonment, grazing and/or mowing,
with varying levels and frequencies of fertilization (Table 1).
PLANT, SOIL AND ECOSYSTEM PARAMETERS
All plant and soil sampling was carried out in 12 50 9 50 cm quad-
rats within each grassland when above-ground biomass was at its
peak between July and August 2010. Total above-ground biomass
and standing litter were estimated in these quadrats using a calibrated
visual approach (Lavorel et al. 2008).
Surveys of vegetation composition were performed using the BOT-
ANAL method to estimate species relative biomass (Lavorel et al.
2008). Plant vegetative traits (vegetative height – VH; speciﬁc leaf
area – SLA; leaf dry matter content – LDMC; leaf C and N concen-
trations – LCC and LNC), assumed to be relevant to ecosystem pro-
cesses and the provision of ecosystem services (Quétier, Thébault &
Lavorel 2007; Lavorel et al. 2011), were measured following standard
protocols for each of the species that collectively made up 80% of
the cumulated biomass (Garnier et al. 2007). For each plant trait, we
calculated
community-weighted
mean
(CWM;
Garnier
et al.
2004) and functional divergence (FD; Mason et al. 2003) using the
F-Diversity package (Casanoves et al. 2011).
Subsequently, four upper soil cores per quadrat were sampled down
to 5 or 10 cm depth depending on site speciﬁcity. These soil cores
were pooled to obtain a composite soil sample, which was passed
through a 5.6-mm sieve. Subsamples of soil were stored at 4 °C
for soil chemical analyses and measurements of enzymatic activities, or
at 20 °C until DNA extraction for molecular analysis of microbial
communities. A ﬁfth soil core per quadrat was taken to measure bulk
density. This core was also used to study potential leaching of soil
nitrate (NO
3 -N) and ammonium (NHþ
4 -N; see next section for details).
ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES
Peak green biomass, standing litter, microbial biomass N, PNM, soil
% organic matter content (SOM) and potential leaching of NO
3 -N
and NHþ
4 -N, were selected as key ecosystem properties likely to be
related to above-ground plant and soil microbial traits.
Above-ground phytomass was sorted to living and dead material,
dried (60 °C, 7 days), weighed, ground and analysed for total C and
N contents using a Flash EA1112 (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA) or a Vario EL III (Elementar Analysensysteme
GmbH, Hanau, Germany)
elemental analyser.
Standardized
soil
methods for long-term ecological research were used to estimate soil-
related
parameters
(Robertson
et al.
1999).
PNM
rates
were
determined using anaerobic incubations of fresh soil subsamples
(dark, 7 days, 40 °C), during which organic N was mineralized and
accumulated as NHþ
4 -N (Waring & Bremner 1964; Wienhold 2007).
The difference between NHþ
4 contents in a given sample before (t1)
and
after
the
anaerobic
incubation
(t2)
gave
PNM = [(NHþ
4 -
N)t2(NHþ
4 -N)t1]/dw/7 days. SOM % was obtained by loss on igni-
tion. Soil microbial biomass N was determined using the chloroform
fumigation–extraction procedure (Brookes et al. 1985; Voroney, Win-
ter & Beyaert 1993). Finally, potentially leached NHþ
4 -N and NO
3 -N
were calculated from percolates of the ﬁfth soil core/quadrat leached
with a given volume of distilled water (de Vries et al. 2011).
POTENTIAL ENZYMATIC ACTIVITIES OF NITRIFIER AND
DENITRIFIER MICRO-ORGANISMS
Potential rates of nitriﬁcation were assessed according to Dassonville
et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, 3 g dw from each composite fresh soil sample
from each quadrat was incubated under aerobic conditions (180 rpm,
28 °C, 10 h) in a solution of (NH4)2SO4 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 15 mg
N L1). Rates of NO2 and NO3 production were measured after 2 h,
4 h, 8 h and 10 h by ionic chromatography (DX120; Dionex, Salt
Lake City, UT, USA). Maximal nitriﬁcation rate (Vmax) and NH4
afﬁnity (1/Km) were assessed by plotting nitriﬁcation rates along the
gradient of NH4 concentrations (Lineweaver & Burk 1934). Potential
denitriﬁcation enzyme activity (DEA) was measured according to
Attard et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, c. 10 g dw soil was placed at 28 °C
under anaerobic conditions using 90 : 10 He : C2H2 mixture inhibit-
ing N2O-reductase activity. Each ﬂask was supplemented with c.
3 mL KNO3 (50 lg N-NO
3 g1 dw), glucose (0.5 mg C g1 dw)
and sodium glutamate (0.5 mg C g1 dw), completed with distilled
water to reach the water-holding capacity. N2O was measured at 2, 4,
5 and 6 h using a gas chromatograph (microGC RS3000; SRA
instruments, Marcy l’Etoile, France).
QUANTIFICATION OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES
INVOLVED IN NITRIFICATION AND DENITRIFICATION
Soil fungi and bacteria biomasses were determined using phospho-
lipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) using the extraction, fractionation
and quantiﬁcation of microbial phospholipids (Bardgett, Hobbs &
Frostegard 1996). The fatty acids i150 : 0, a150 : 0, 15 : , i16 : 0,
17 : 0, i17 : 0, cy17 : 0, cis18 : 1x7 and cy19 : 0 were chosen to
represent bacterial fatty acids and 18 : 2x6 to represent fungal fatty
acids (Bardgett & McAlister 1999). Finally, the ratio of fungi : bacte-
ria PLFA (F : B) was calculated.
To measure abundance of nitriﬁers, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and
archaea were quantiﬁed based on the gene copy numbers of the ammo-
nia monooxigenase gene amoA present in soil (amoA-AOB amoA-
AOA), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were quantiﬁed based on the copy
numbers of two targeted genes: nrxA of Nitrobacter and 16S rRNA of
Nitrospira (Ns). Denitrifying microbes were quantiﬁed using the abun-
dance of both types of nitrite reductase genes (nirS and nirK). Soil DNA
was extracted from 0.5 g of fresh soil using the FastDNA® SPIN Kit for
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA) and the Precellys24 Instrument
(Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Quantity and
quality of extracted DNA were tested by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop;
PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Quantitative Real-Time PCR was carried
out using SYBR green as ﬂuorescent dye. Protocol efﬁciency, levels of
qPCR and inhibition levels of DNA extracts are detailed in Appendix S1
(Supporting information).

DATA ANALYSES
We used correlative modelling to quantify the respective contribu-
tions
of
plant
and
microbial
traits
to
variations
in
measured
ecosystem processes. We used linear mixed models with residual
maximum likelihood (REML) estimations. Linear mixed models are
a powerful class of models that are, in particular, appropriate for the
analysis of grouped or clustered data, with grasslands considered as
replicates grouped within each of the three experimental sites
(Stubai, Lautaret, Yorkshire Dales). The REML algorithm, by associ-
ating common random effects with observations within the same
group, allows for the speciﬁcation of the covariance structure
induced by the grouping of the data and provides estimations of
parameter effects and variance components for both the ﬁxed and
random effects in the model. The general structure of our analyses
involved each of the ecosystem process response variables (peak
green biomass, standing litter, SOM %, potential leached soil NO3-N
and NH4-N, microbial biomass N, PNM) being modelled as a
function of the ﬁxed effect plant trait parameters SLA (CWM and
FDvar), vegetative height (CWM and FDvar), LDMC (CWM and
FDvar), LNC (CWM and FDvar), LCC (CWM and FDvar), C/N
(CWM and FDvar) and microbial properties (Vmax, 1/Km, DEA,
F : B ratio, abundances of nirS, nirK, amoA-AOA, amoA-AOB, Ns,
nxrA genes and nirK : nirS, AOA : AOB, Ns : nxrA ratios), with
site (Stubai, Lautaret, Yorkshire Dales) speciﬁed as a random effect.
Analyses were carried out using the average information (AI) algo-
rithm to estimate variance parameters within the software package
Genstat 11th edition (VSN International, Hempstead, UK). All
variables were tested for normality, and log transformations applied
as required, prior to analysis.
To provide an objective methodology for the selection of the most
parsimonious model (Díaz et al. 2007), analyses were conducted in
two steps. First, we determined the effect of each of the plant and
microbial trait parameters in isolation on each of the ecosystem pro-
cesses using a series of single explanatory variable REML linear
models. These analyses yielded, for each ecosystem process, a list of
those plant and microbial parameters signiﬁcantly correlated with the
ecosystem process, as well as the percentage of variation in the eco-
system process they explained.
Second, to develop multivariable models for each ecosystem pro-
cess, a hierarchical approach was used in which plant trait parameters
were ﬁtted as ﬁxed factors ﬁrst, with microbial effects being ﬁtted
afterwards (following Lavorel et al. 2009). This bottom-up approach
to ecosystem functioning was based on the assumption that plant
traits have a large inﬂuence on microbial traits (Orwin et al. 2010),
thus considering residual microbial effects after plant effects have
been accounted for. Within the set of plant trait parameters, CWM
parameters were ﬁtted ﬁrst, followed by FDvar parameters following
Díaz et al. (2007), assuming that functional variance effects are only
of interest beyond those main effects of functional mean effects (with
which they are often correlated; Dias et al. 2013). To develop the
most explanatory, parsimonious models, for each ecosystem process,
only those variables signiﬁcant from the single variable analyses were
used, and these were ﬁtted in the order of the percentage variation in
the ecosystem process they explained individually. Each response var-
iable was added to the model in a stepwise manner, with those vari-
ables signiﬁcant in the presence of previously ﬁtted variables being
retained in the model and variables no longer signiﬁcant in the pres-
ence of other variables, due to colinearity, being removed from the
model. This was especially the case for multiple correlated leaf traits
that form the leaf economics spectrum, but which we decided not to
select a priori or to combine into a single multivariate proxy in order
to preserve interpretability based on individual traits. We veriﬁed the
relevance of this approach by running all alternative models for colin-
ear variables with an adjusted R² of at least 0.3. Convergence upon a
ﬁnal multiple variable model occurred once all the plant and micro-
bial trait parameters signiﬁcant individually for a given ecosystem
process had been ﬁtted, and either retained or discarded from the
model. These ﬁnal models allowed us to calculate the percentage of
variation in the ecosystem process explained by the retained ﬁxed fac-
tors, the breakdown of this variation among plant traits and microbial
traits, and the effect of each of the retained parameters on the ecosys-
tem process.
Results
Results from the single variable models are presented as Sup-
porting information (Table S2). The stepwise multiple variable
model ﬁtting procedure was designed to produce the most bio-
logically meaningful and parsimonious model possible from
the wide range of potential explanatory variables, by adding
explanatory variables in the order of their perceived biological
importance (ﬁrst CWM plant traits, followed by FDvar plant
traits and then microbial variables), and amount of variation
explained (Table 2). We acknowledge, however, that in the
case of colinearity between variables used in the ﬁnal model,
it is possible that other combinations of explanatory variables
could explain similar amounts of variation and that this could
have implications for our conclusions. Table S3 presents, for
each ecosystem parameter, those explanatory variables not
retained in the ﬁnal models that had signiﬁcant colinearity (a
signiﬁcant adjusted R² of > 0.3) with the variables retained in
the ﬁnal ‘best’ model (Table 2). Each of the possible alterna-
tive multiple variable models stemming from the replacement
of the originally retained variables by these collinear ones is
then presented. As none of the alternative models tested
explained as much variance as the ‘best’ models retained
through the hierarchical stepwise model ﬁtting procedure
(Table 2), we now focus on the latter.
The results of the multiple variable REML models revealed
a shift in importance from plant to microbial traits along a
gradient from vegetation properties, such as peak green bio-
mass and standing litter, to soil processes, such as potential
leaching of soil inorganic N (NO3-N or NH4-N) and N miner-
alization potential (Table 2; see also Table S3 for alternative
models with collinear variables). The overall amounts of vari-
ation explained in the multivariable models by the retained
ﬁxed effects (over and above variation in these variables
between the sites, removed as a random factor) ranged from
40% to 87%.
Variation in peak green biomass and soil microbial biomass
N were overwhelmingly explained by functional properties of
the vegetation (95% and 85% of variation explained due to
plant traits, respectively; Table 2). Strong positive relation-
ships between peak green biomass and CWM vegetative
height (Fig. 1a), and soil microbial biomass N and CWM
vegetative height (Table 2), were found at all sites. Both vari-
ables were also correlated with CWM SLA, but across the
three sites this relationship was positive for peak green bio-

mass (Table 2) and negative for soil microbial biomass N
(Fig. 1b). In addition, FD in vegetative height had a minor
negative effect on peak green biomass, but a minor positive
effect on soil microbial biomass N (Table 2). The relationship
between peak green biomass or soil microbial biomass N,
respectively, with microbial functional parameters (5% and
15% of variation explained, respectively; Table 2) was con-
siderably less than plant trait effects.
Litter mass was mostly explained by plant trait parameters
describing the quantity and quality of plant biomass (83% of
variation explained due to plant traits). Across the three sites,
litter mass was negatively correlated with CWM SLA and
positively
correlated
with
vegetative
height
(Table 2),

(50% of the variance explained each by these groups of
parameters; Table 2). The signiﬁcant plant trait parameters
describe the quality of the vegetation being input into the soil,
with increasing SOM content being positively correlated with
increasing CWM LDMC (Fig. 1d) and decreasing CWM
SLA
(Table 2).
Overall,
potential
denitriﬁcation
activity
(DEA) was positively related to SOM content, although this
relationship did not hold at the French site (Fig. 2a).
Variations in potential inorganic N (NO3-N or NH4-N)
leaching and PNM were mainly explained by parameters
describing N-cycling soil microbial communities (75–84% of
variation). Increases in the Vmax of potential nitriﬁcation
were strongly linked to increases in potential leaching of
NO3-N in soils from the Yorkshire Dales and Lautaret, but
not from Stubai (Fig. 2b). Similarly, increases in potential
denitriﬁcation activities (DEA) were positively correlated
with higher N mineralization and increased ammonia leach-
ing potentials at all three sites (Table 2 and Fig. 2c,d). For
potential soil NO3-N and NH4-N leaching, a minor effect
was also exerted by plant trait parameters linked with the
quality of plant biomass. Decreased FD of leaf C : N was
positively correlated with potential NO3-N leaching, while
CWM SLA was negatively related to NH4-N leaching. Fur-
thermore, plant CWM LDMC showed a positive relationship
with PNM (Table 2).
Discussion
ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF PLANT AND MICROBIAL
FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS ON ECOSYSTEM
FUNCTIONING
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to provide a direct
quantiﬁcation, in the ﬁeld, of the relative roles of plant traits
and microbes in explaining a comprehensive and complemen-
tary set of ecosystem properties. Our models, combining plant
traits and soil microbial properties, explained high amounts of
variance (60─90%) in ecosystem properties (Table 2), demon-
strating the value of combining plant functional traits and soil
microbial
properties
to
quantify
ecosystem
functioning
(Wardle et al. 2004; De Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett 2008).
Because our objective was not to obtain a mechanistic causal
model (see, e.g. Laughlin 2011; Laliberté & Tylianakis 2012),
nor to incorporate plant–soil feedback (Ehrenfeld, Ravit &
Elgersma 2005), our analyses did not explicitly incorporate
abiotic effects. However, as abiotic variation occurred largely
between sites, the use of site as a random factor accounted
for much of the direct effects on ecosystem properties.
Our results are consistent with previous studies which show
that leaf and size traits explained 60─80% of variance in
ANPP (Garnier et al. 2004; Ansquer et al. 2009; Schumacher
& Roscher 2009; Lavorel et al. 2011; Minden & Kleyer
2011; Laliberté & Tylianakis 2012; Lienin & Kleyer 2012).
Whilst, overall, 40─50% of variance in leaf litter decomposi-
tion was explained by leaf economics traits (meta-analysis by
Cornwell et al. 2008; Fortunel et al. 2009; Lienin & Kleyer
2012). Eviner & Chapin (2003) suggested that plant trait
effects should be weak for processes involving soil biodiver-
sity. Indeed, Laughlin (2011) found that leaf economics
spectrum traits explained only 37% of variation in nitriﬁcation
potential in Pinus ponderosa forest understorey. Here, we
demonstrated that the incorporation of soil microbial parame-
ters into models signiﬁcantly improved our ability to explain
below-ground ecosystem processes, typically from < 30%
with plant traits alone (Table S1) to 60─80% (Table 2).
Further, by portioning variance in ecosystem properties
between plant traits and soil microbial properties associated
with N turnover, we identiﬁed a continuum of variation from
ecosystem properties associated mostly with vegetation traits
(> 80% of the explained variance represented by plant traits),
such as peak green biomass and standing litter, to ecosystem
properties associated mostly with microbial processes, such as
soil potential leaching of inorganic N or PNM (> 74% of the
explained variance represented by microbial traits). Although
we chose a bottom-up approach to quantify direct microbial
effects on ecosystem properties beyond those effects already
accounted for plant traits, such microbial effects appeared
considerable, as suggested by Eviner & Chapin (2003).

MECHANISMS UNDERPINNING EFFECTS OF PLANT
FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS ON ECOSYSTEM
PROPERTIES
Plant trait effects were overwhelmingly attributed to CWM,
supporting the biomass ratio hypothesis and suggesting that
traits of the dominant species drive biogeochemical cycling
(Grime 1998; Mokany, Ash & Roxburgh 2008; Laughlin
2011; Lavorel et al. 2011). Some non-negligible effects of
FD were also retained in the models, though their mechanistic
explanation is more tentative. Smaller variance in vegetative
height was associated with increased peak biomass, which
suggests that plant communities strongly dominated by tall
plants were most productive (see Laliberté & Tylianakis
2012). This could feed forward to a greater input of resources
and/or diversity of habitats for soil micro-organisms and thus
explain the positive relationship between FDvar_height and
microbial biomass N. A greater diversity in root architectures
and quality (FDvar C : N) may also promote better nitrate
uptake and thereby lower potential nitrate leaching.
Parallel to the continuum from plant traits to microbial
properties, there was within-plant traits, a continuum from
plant quantity, linked more with peak biomass, to plant
quality parameters, linked more with the recycling of organic
matter (Fig. 3). First, community mean plant height was
strongly and positively related to peak green biomass and
standing litter, as fast growing, taller species produced more
biomass over the season (Ansquer et al. 2009; Lavorel et al.
2011) and thus more litter (Lavorel et al. 2011; Laliberté &
Tylianakis 2012; Lavorel & Grigulis 2012). In turn, greater
litter inputs to soil, and possibly greater root biomass, might
stimulate microbial biomass N by providing more resources
for microbes in the rhizosphere (Zak et al. 1994; Paterson
2003; Tscherko et al. 2004).
Secondly, effects on ecosystem processes of leaf economics
spectrum traits that reﬂect the quality of plant material entering
the soil (Freschet et al. 2010) were consistent with expecta-
tions of nutrient turnover being faster in communities domi-
nated by exploitative species (high SLA and LNC, low
LDMC) and, conversely, slower in communities dominated by
conservative species (opposite traits; Chapin 1993, 2003; Lavo-
rel & Grigulis 2012). The positive effect of CWM SLA on
peak biomass is expected to result from faster growth (Reich,
Walters & Ellsworth 1997; Garnier et al. 2004; Pontes Da
Silva et al. 2007), while its negative effect on litter mass
resulted from poor decomposability of conservative species
(Cornwell et al. 2008; Mokany, Ash & Roxburgh 2008; Min-
den & Kleyer 2011). Indeed, at the Lautaret and Stubai sites,
the annual rate of litter decomposition was positively correlated
with CWM LNC (data not shown; see also Quétier, Thébault
& Lavorel 2007; Rubatscher 2008). The observed association
between more conservative plants and greater soil organic mat-
ter content is consistent with both theory (De Deyn, Cornelis-
sen & Bardgett 2008) and evidence from monoculture and
mesocosm studies (De Deyn et al. 2009; Orwin et al. 2010).
In contrast to above-ground processes, effects of leaf eco-
nomics spectrum traits on the soil microbial compartment are
poorly understood. The strong negative relationship between
CWM SLA and microbial biomass N suggests that the
amount of N immobilized by the microbial biomass increases
where conservative plants dominate. This ﬁnding is broadly
consistent with
15N labelling studies which show that soil
microbial communities compete more effectively with plants
for N in nutrient poor grasslands where conservative species
dominate, than in nutrient-rich grasslands dominated by N
rich plants, leading to greater microbial immobilization and
retention of N in the former (Bardgett, Streeter & Bol 2003;
Harrison, Bol & Bardgett 2007; Robson et al. 2010).
Collectively, these results strongly support the relevance of
the leaf economics spectrum not only to above-ground bio-
mass and litter decomposition or litter pools, but also to soil
processes as expected from theory (De Deyn, Cornelissen &
Bardgett 2008) and recent empirical studies (Laughlin 2011;
Pakeman 2011; see also Craine et al. 2002). As such, they
support the plant economics spectrum hypothesis and its
implications for soil processes (Freschet et al. 2010). To
complement this systemic view of plant economics, analyses
would need to incorporate root traits (Craine et al. 2002;
Klumpp et al. 2009; Orwin et al. 2010), even though it has
been argued that their effects can be captured through leaf
traits (Craine et al. 2001; De Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett
2008; Laliberté & Tylianakis 2012).
MECHANISMS UNDERPINNING ASSOCIATIONS OF
MICROBIAL PROPERTIES WITH ECOSYSTEM
PROPERTIES
As expected, we observed strong links between microbial
functional properties and below-ground processes such as
potential mineral N leaching, PNM (84% variance explained)
and SOM content (50% variance explained). Microbial prop-
erties measured under optimal conditions, such as potential
denitriﬁcation activity (DEA), nitriﬁcation afﬁnity (1/Km) and
nitriﬁcation maximum rate (Vmax), may be considered as
microbial functional traits that directly or indirectly inﬂuence
ecosystem properties. Our correlative approach should only
be interpreted as statistical associations, rather than demon-

between
microbial
activities and ecosystem services.
Speciﬁcally, we focused on two different functional groups,
which catalyse different processes of N turnover: nitriﬁers
and denitriﬁers. Nitriﬁcation is a two-step aerobic microbial
process fuelled by N mineralization and performed by auto-
trophic ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing microbes (Schauss
et al. 2009). First, lower litter mineralization decreases NHþ
4
availability and may thus increase plant–microbe competition
for available NHþ
4 (Skiba et al. 2011). As higher standing lit-
ter mass results from poor mineralization, this mechanism
could explain its positive correlation with nitriﬁers’ afﬁnity
for NHþ
4 (1/Km). Second, the observed positive effect of nitri-
ﬁcation rate (Vmax) on potential nitrate leaching directly
reﬂects the production by nitriﬁers of NO
3 that is not retained
by negatively charged surfaces in soil. In contrast, denitriﬁers
are heterotrophic facultative anaerobic microbes that reduce
NO
3 to gaseous N forms. They strongly depend on plant-
derived C, and their activity is highly inﬂuenced by redox
conditions in soil and hence by water content or soil texture.
As for nitriﬁers’ afﬁnity for NHþ
4 , litter mass was also nega-
tively correlated with denitrifying microbes harbouring the
nitrite reductase gene nirS, conﬁrming previous reports that
nirS-harbouring bacteria are out-competed by other denitriﬁ-
ers in habitats with high C availability (Bannert et al. 2011).
This strong dependency of denitriﬁers on available C sources
may also explain the close link of DEA to SOM, which is
mainly formed from plant-derived C. Although nitriﬁers and
denitriﬁers exhibit different life histories and occupy different
niches in soil (Keil et al. 2011), denitriﬁers strongly depend
on the activity of nitriﬁers. This is because NO
3 , the substrate
for denitriﬁcation, is exclusively formed by nitriﬁers from
NHþ
4 (Prosser 1989), itself being sourced from N mineraliza-
tion. Consequently, PNM was positively and indirectly corre-
lated with DEA. Also, when N mineralization is high, NHþ
4
leaching may occur (Qian & Cai 2007), which may support
the positive, but indirect, correlation between DEA and poten-
tial NHþ
4 leaching.
The future investigation of other functionally important
microbes, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N-ﬁx-
ing microbes, or of microbial communities with reduced
functional redundancy, such as those that are involved in
the degradation of highly polymeric substances like lignin
or other phenolic compounds, may show an even more sig-
niﬁcant contribution of microbial properties to abiotic soil
properties.
A SYNTHETIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROVISION OF
MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
Our analyses provide a synthetic hypothesis for the control of
the provision of multiple ecosystem services by grasslands
(Fig. 3). More exploitative plant strategies (high SLA, high
LNC, low LDMC) and taller swards are expected to result in
greater fodder production (peak green biomass), but at the
cost of poor C and nutrient retention. This is most probably
because they are associated with soil microbial communities
dominated by procaryotes that perform rapid rates of minerali-
zation and nitriﬁcation. Conversely, dominance by plants with
conservative strategies (high LDMC and C : N ratio) usually
results in low fodder production, but provides beneﬁts for soil
C sequestration and nutrient retention, which is potentially
linked to the dominance of microbial communities dominated
by fungi, co-occurring with procaryotes with slow activities.
Because conservative and exploitative plants are likely to
impact differently on microbial subgroups, further studies
should explore whether changes in microbial activity levels
relate to speciﬁc groups among nitriﬁers/denitriﬁers or other
microbial functional groups harbouring contrasted activity
levels.
Such a framework could have important implications for
the management of ecosystem services trade-offs. Our results
demonstrate that the effects of plant traits and microbial prop-
erties on ecosystem functioning underpin critical trade-offs
between production and regulation ecosystem services. Thus,
we suggest that management intensity and associated changes
in soil fertility can steer the provision of multiple ecosystem
services, through their effects on plant and soil microbial
community composition.
Conclusion
This is the ﬁrst trait-based study, to the best of our knowl-
edge, providing a direct quantiﬁcation, in the ﬁeld, of the
relative roles of plant and microbial functional traits for a
comprehensive set of above- and below-ground ecosystem
properties. By demonstrating a continuum from tight coupling
with plant traits for above-ground processes to strong linkages
with microbial traits for below-ground processes, we conﬁrm
the need and reﬁne the scope for the incorporation of soil
functional diversity into analyses of biodiversity effects on
ecosystem
functioning.
Although
we
used
a
correlative
approach, our results highlighted functional markers of eco-
system functioning, including the leaf economics spectrum
and a range of soil microbial properties related to nutrient
cycling, such as denitriﬁcation potential. Such markers need
to be tested over a wider range of ecosystems, and their varia-
tions with key environmental gradients need to be docu-
mented and better understood. In particular, the lack of data
and limited understanding of both plant and microbial trait
effects on below-ground processes needs to be addressed.
Furthermore, in the future, such knowledge should support
the management of ecosystem services trade-offs by selecting
desired plant and soil functional properties.

Summary
1. Carbon storage in vegetation and soil underpins climate regulation through carbon sequestration.
Because plant species differ in their ability to capture, store and release carbon, the collective func-
tional characteristics of plant communities (functional diversity) should be a major driver of carbon
accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems.
2. Three major components of plant functional diversity could be put forward as drivers of carbon
storage in ecosystems: the most abundant functional trait values, the variety of functional trait values
and the abundance of particular species that could have additional effects not incorporated in the
ﬁrst two components.
3. We tested for associations between these components and carbon storage across 16 sites in the
Chaco forest of Argentina under the same climate and on highly similar parental material. The sites
differed in their plant functional diversity caused by different long-term land-use regimes.
4. We measured six plant functional traits in 27 species and weighted them by the species abun-
dance at each site to calculate the community-weighted mean (CWM) and the functional divergence
(FDvar) of each single trait and of multiple traits (FDiv). We also measured plant and soil carbon
storage. Using a stepwise multiple regression analysis, we assessed which of the functional diversity
components best explained carbon storage.
5. Both CWM and FDvar of plant height and wood-speciﬁc gravity, but no leaf traits, were retained
as predictors of carbon storage in multiple models. Relationships of FDvar of stem traits and FDiv
with carbon storage were all negative. The abundance of ﬁve species improved the predictive power
of some of the carbon storage models.
6. Synthesis. All three major components of plant functional diversity contributed to explain carbon
storage. What matters the most to carbon storage in these ecosystems is the relative abundance of plants
with tall, and to a lesser extent dense, stems with a narrow range of variation around these values. No
consistent link was found between carbon storage and the leaf traits usually associated with plant
resource use strategy. The negative association of trait divergence with carbon storage provided no evi-
dence in support to niche complementarity promoting carbon storage in these forest ecosystems.

Introduction
Increasingly compelling evidence of global climatic change as
a result of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
(IPCC 2007) has greatly stimulated the interest in biological
carbon (C) sequestration in natural ecosystems, and particu-
larly forests. An effective climate control by terrestrial ecosys-
tems not only depends on the rate of C uptake by primary
producers (i.e. their sink capacity), but also on the rate of C
release from the biota, the permanence of stocks and the
probability of abrupt release due to episodes of natural or
human disturbance (Catovsky, Bradford & Hector 2002;

Schulze, Valentini & Sanz 2002; Díaz, Hector & Wardle
2009a). C stocks at any given point in time reﬂect the net bal-
ance between these uptake, loss and retention processes.
Moreover, because different plant species differ in their
ability to capture, store and release C, the collective func-
tional characteristics of plant communities, under a given
regional climatic regime, should be a major driver of C
sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems (Catovsky, Bradford &
Hector
2002;
De
Deyn,
Cornelissen
&
Bardgett
2008;
Thompson et al. 2009). One way to conceptualize these func-
tional characteristics of communities is functional diversity,
deﬁned as the value, range, distribution and relative abun-
dance of functional traits of the organisms that make up an
ecosystem (Díaz et al. 2007). This deﬁnition of functional
diversity includes functional identity and is more comprehen-
sive than those that are explicitly restricted to the variability
of traits (e.g. Petchey & Gaston (2006)) and thus is closer to
the concept of ‘functional structure of communities’ proposed
by Mouillot et al. (2011), also called ‘functional composition’
by other authors.
A central question here is which plant functional traits
should be functionally the most relevant. This is the case as
these are the ones that should be measured, in order to char-
acterize functional diversity in situations involving different
ecosystem properties of interest. In this respect, there is now
an important body of literature pointing to the plant functional
traits and trait syndromes that should be most important, spe-
ciﬁcally for C storage at the ecosystem level. The amount of
wood in the vegetation and its C content clearly drive the
total amount of C stored above-ground and below-ground.
Plants traits associated with a larger biomass and a higher
investment in structure per unit of biomass, such as height
and wood-speciﬁc gravity (WSG), are therefore expected to
directly inﬂuence above-ground and below-ground ecosystem
C storage (Baker et al. 2004; Moles et al. 2009). Larger
plants are also expected to shed more biomass in the form of
leaf and woody litter per unit ground area and thus contribute
directly to C accumulation in the standing litter and in the
organic soil (Garnier et al. 2004; Lavorel & Grigulis 2012).
Functional traits related with plant tissue quality, such as
WSG, leaf nutrient concentration, leaf area displayed per unit
C and leaf toughness (LT), also inﬂuence the residence time
of both living tissues and litter and therefore indirectly inﬂu-
ence C storage in the soil (Aerts & Chapin 2000; Chapin
2003; Wardle et al. 2004; De Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett
2008). In particular, there is evidence of a trade-off between a
suite of attributes promoting fast C acquisition and fast
decomposition and another suite of attributes which promote
the conservation of resources within well-protected tissues
and slow decomposition (Grime 1979; Grime et al. 1997;
Reich, Walters & Ellsworth 1997; Díaz et al. 2004; Wright
et al. 2004). This trade-off, called the acquisition vs. conser-
vation axis (Díaz et al. 2004) or the leaf economic spectrum
(Wright et al. 2004), is strongly driven by a set of coordi-
nated leaf traits. For example, acquisitive resource use syn-
dromes are characterized by the combination of attributes
such as high speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), high leaf concentration
of nitrogen (LNC) and phosphorous, low LT and low leaf dry
matter content (LDMC), which are consistently associated
with high C input through photosynthesis and also high C
losses through decomposition (e.g. Herms & Mattson 1992;
Grime et al. 1996, 1997; Díaz et al. 2004; Wright et al.
2004; Poorter & Garnier 2007; Cornwell et al. 2008; Poorter
et al. 2009; Freschet, Aerts & Cornelissen 2012). Conserva-
tive syndromes are characterized by the opposite attributes. At
the ecosystem level, prevailing acquisitive syndromes should
be conducive to higher C ﬂuxes, whereas prevailing conser-
vative syndromes should be conducive to higher C stocks
(Wardle et al. 2004; De Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett 2008;
Díaz, Hector & Wardle 2009a).
Another crucial aspect in the investigation of the links
between functional diversity and ecosystem properties is that
major components of functional diversity, most prominently
the trait values of the most abundant species (sometimes
called ‘functional identity’) or the variety of trait values pres-
ent in the community (called ‘functional diversity’ by other
authors), are the most strongly associated with ecosystem
functionality. These components have often been associated
with different mechanistic models of diversity effects on eco-
system properties. According to the mass ratio hypothesis,
proposed by Grime (1998), the role of species in the ecosys-
tem is proportional to their biomass; therefore, the most abun-
dant values of plant functional traits will be the main
determining factors of the total C stored in the ecosystem
above- and below-ground compartments (Díaz, Hector &
Wardle 2009a). On the other hand, according to the niche-
complementarity hypothesis (Trenbath 1974), the coexistence
of different functional strategies, embodied in the presence
of diverging values of functional traits, such as stratiﬁed
mixtures of sun-adapted species in the overstorey and shade-
adapted species in the understorey (Pretzsch 2005; Lavorel &
Grigulis 2012), or the combination of species with different
rooting patterns (Davis & Mooney 1986; Sala et al. 1989)
should lead to a fuller resource exploitation by the plant com-
munity as a whole across time and space. This should be
reﬂected in higher standing biomass, which could directly
lead to enhanced C storage in plant biomass and also in soil
through higher input of senescent material (Scherer-Lorenzen,
Bonilla & Potvin 2007). The presence of senescent material
of contrasting quality (i.e. different LT or nutrient concentra-
tion) has also been reported to affect litter decomposition rate
and thus soil C storage. However, it cannot be strictly consid-
ered as part of the niche-complementarity effect, and the
direction of these effects varies widely and seems to be
strongly context-dependent (Hättenschwiler, Tiunov & Scheu
2005; Nadrowski, Wirth & Scherer-Lorenzen 2010).
The mass ratio and niche-complementarity models are not
necessarily mutually exclusive; both have been shown to
operate in natural ecosystems and can have different relative
importance in different situations (Potvin & Gotelli 2008;
Díaz, Hector & Wardle 2009b; Mouillot et al. 2011). In addi-
tion, idiosyncratic effects of particular species are common
(Scherer-Lorenzen, Bonilla & Potvin 2007; Díaz, Hector &
Wardle 2009b). Consequently, Díaz et al. (2007) proposed a

conceptual and analytical approach to test them simulta-
neously in situations that not necessarily involve experimental
manipulation.
This
is
particularly
relevant
to
naturally
established, species-rich woody ecosystems where manipula-
tion according to traditional experimental design rules is often
unfeasible or prohibitively costly.
Most of the evidence of the effect of functional plant com-
position on ecosystem processes has been derived from experi-
ments on highly simpliﬁed systems (Tilman et al. 1997;
Thompson et al. 2005; Fornara & Tilman 2008; Steinbeiss
et al. 2008; De Deyn et al. 2009; Pakeman, Eastwood &
Scobie 2011; Roscher et al. 2012). Whilst this has the advanta-
ges of experimental design and control of covarying factors, it
has the disadvantage of not necessarily representing the most
important mechanisms operating in real ecosystems (Leuschner,
Jungkunst & Fleck 2009). Some authors have experimentally
removed species or functional groups from initially homoge-
neous communities in the ﬁeld, both herbaceous (Symstad &
Tilman 2001; Polley et al. 2006; McLaren & Turkington
2010; Joner et al. 2011) and woody (Aguiar & Sala 1994; Díaz
et al. 2003; Bret-Harte et al. 2008; Wardle, Lagerström &
Nilsson 2008; Urcelay et al. 2009). However, in forest com-
munities, experimental manipulation is prohibitively costly.
Several studies have taken advantage of mixed-species and
mono-speciﬁc tree plantations (e.g.Vilà et al. 2003; Pretzsch
2005; Erskine, Lamb & Bristow 2006; Firn, Erskine & Lamb
2007; Scherer-Lorenzen, Bonilla & Potvin 2007; Scherer-
Lorenzen et al. 2007; Vilà et al. 2007; Nadrowski, Wirth &
Scherer-Lorenzen 2010; Potvin et al. 2011), but these experi-
ments do not necessarily mimic the species richness, age struc-
ture and combination of growth forms typical of naturally
established forests. Just a few studies have compared the effect
of different levels of functional diversity in natural forest or
evaluated the importance of speciﬁc functional traits for differ-
ent ecosystem processes within natural forest ecosystems
(Caspersen & Pacala 2001; Mayﬁeld et al. 2005; Delagrange
et al. 2008; Jonsson & Wardle 2010; Ruiz-Jaen & Potvin
2011; Wardle et al. 2012). In summary, empirical studies of
the links between functional trait composition and C storage in
naturally established forest ecosystems are still very rare.
In this paper, we aimed to investigate the effects of plant
functional diversity on C storage in ecosystems of the semi-arid
Chaco forest of Córdoba, Argentina. Using the approach of
Díaz et al. (2007), we tested for associations between different
components of functional diversity (most abundant functional
trait values, variety of functional trait values and the abundance
of particular species) and C storage in different ecosystem com-
partments. Speciﬁcally, we tested the hypotheses that, under the
same climatic and soil parent material conditions:
1 Functional diversity affects C storage in the standing vege-
tation, litter and soil via the effects of the dominant (locally
most abundant) functional trait values on C dynamics. Plant
communities dominated by plants with a higher investment in
structure (taller and with a denser stem) and showing a more
conservative resource use syndrome (lower values of SLA
and LNC, higher values of LDMC and LT) should accumu-
late more C in standing biomass; this should also lead to a
larger C stock in the soil, because of a higher C input and a
longer C residence time.
2 Functional diversity affects C accumulation in plant and
soil stocks via the effects of the presence of diverging func-
tional trait values on C dynamics. The coexistence of plants
with contrasting functional trait values should lead to a fuller
use of resources by the community as a whole and thus to
higher biomass production and higher C input into the soil,
increasing both above-ground and soil C stocks.
Materials and methods
STUDY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The study was carried out in the southern extreme of the Gran
Chaco, in central Argentina (c. 31°17′–31°50′ S and 65°16′–65°
32′ W). The climate is subtropical with a mean annual precipitation
of 600 mm distributed in spring–summer (October–March) and a
mean annual temperature of 18 °C. Soils are mainly sandy-loam
aridisols of alluvial origin (Gorgas & Tassile 2003). The dominant
vegetation is a xerophytic forest with the trees Aspidosperma que-
bracho-blanco and Prosopis ﬂexuosa as canopy and subcanopy do-
minants,
respectively.
The
shrub
layer
is
often
dense
and
dominated by Mimozyganthus carinatus, Acacia gilliesii and Larrea
divaricata (Cabido et al. 1992). At present, the Chaco primary for-
est can only be found in very small patches embedded in a mosaic
of other types of vegetation in different stages of succession or
deterioration, as a result of land use, including logging, livestock
grazing and cultivation of annual crops, with different degrees of
intensiﬁcation (Zak, Cabido & Hodgson 2004). Previous studies
suggest that these different ecosystems store different amounts of C
and that such differences cannot be attributed to differences in cli-
mate or soil parental material (Bonino 2006).
Our research questions required enough variation in plant func-
tional diversity whilst keeping abiotic factors as constant as it is pos-
sible in the ﬁeld. To this end, within the study area, we selected 16
sites corresponding to different ecosystem types, characterized by the
presence of plant communities with different taxonomic and func-
tional diversity: primary forest, secondary forest, closed species-rich
shrubland and open shrubland strongly dominated by L. divaricata.
These different ecosystem types initially corresponded to the same
vegetation, developed under the same climate and on highly similar
parental material, and were derived from it by different long-term
land-use regimes. These consisted of combinations of different inten-
sities of extensive livestock grazing and logging (Cabido et al. 1994).
There were no records or physical signs of ﬁre, ploughing or applica-
tion of soil fertilizer in any of the plots during the past few decades,
and on the basis of historical sources, they were unlikely to have been
tilled during at least the past 150 years. Sites were located at a dis-
tance of at least 1 km apart. At each site, we established a homoge-
neous 50 9 50 m plot (replicate) to carry out vegetation and soil
sampling. Although initially the sites were chosen to match these four
different categories, they actually represent a continuum rather than
discrete categories, because of the nature of the land-use regimes.
Accordingly, there were marked overall similarities in the general
properties of the soils. A description of the land-use regime, soil and
vegetation characteristics of the different ecosystem types is provided
in Table S1 (see Supporting Information).

CARBON STORAGE
In each 50 9 50 m plot, we quantiﬁed C in woody and herbaceous
standing vegetation, litter and soil organic C (SOC) to a depth of
30 cm. All C stocks were expressed in Mg C ha1 (Table S2).
We surveyed all trees > 5 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) in
each of the 50 9 50 m plots and estimated their dry biomass using the
allometric model proposed by Brown (1997) for dry forests. A total of
969 trees were measured across all plots. Although more recent allo-
metric models exist (e.g. Chave et al. 2005), we chose this equation
because it does not include height (H) or WSG, which are functional
traits included in the analysis of functional diversity; this avoids any
circularity in linking C storage with functional diversity. The allometric
model proposed by Brown (1997) used in this study to estimate indi-
vidual tree above-ground dry biomass (AGBt) had the following form:
AGBt ¼ expð0:535 þ log10ðBAÞÞ;
eqn 1
where BA corresponded with basal area (cm2), calculated as p*(d.b.h./
2)2, where d.b.h. corresponded to diameter at the breast height (cm).
This equation tended to underestimate individual tree biomass as
compared to the estimations obtained using Chave et al.’s (2005)
model for dry forests, but the results of the two models were highly
consistent (R2 = 0.95, P < 0.0001; see Fig. S1).
For shrub biomass estimation, we established three 5 9 5 m sub-
plots randomly distributed within each 50 9 50 m plot. In each sub-
plot, we sampled all shrubs (i.e. multi-stemmed individuals) and
small trees (< 5 cm d.b.h.). A total of 772 individuals were measured
across all plots. We estimated individual shrub above-ground dry bio-
mass (AGBs) using a general multi-species equation developed
locally (n = 245, R2 = 0.76, P < 0.0001). This equation was crown-
based and therefore did not include any of the traits used to estimate
functional diversity. The form of the equation is presented below;
more details on its development and its advantages with respect to
non-crown-based equations are presented elsewhere (G. Conti et al.,
unpub. data):
ABGs ¼ 1:176  expð9:58 þ 0:86ðLnðCAÞÞ
eqn 2
where CA = crown area (cm2)
We converted plant woody biomass to C multiplying it by a factor
of 0.5, since C roughly represents 50% of dry woody biomass
(Brown 1997).
We quantiﬁed dry biomass of herbaceous vegetation by harvesting
all above-ground herbaceous biomass in six subplots (0.5 9 0.5 m)
randomly distributed within each 50 9 50 m plot during the peak of
the growing season (summer). The amount of litter was quantiﬁed
by measuring the accumulated ﬁne woody debris and leaf litter in
autumn, after most of the senescent parts of deciduous and semi-
deciduous species material had fallen. This was done by a single col-
lection of all plant material accumulated on the ground surface in six
subplots (0.5 9 0.5 m) randomly distributed within each plot. A sub-
sample of litter and herbaceous vegetation collected at each subplot
was oven-dried at 80 ° C for 3 days, weighed, ground and kept in a
mufﬂe furnace (INDEF mod. 331) at 500 °C for 4 h to obtain the
ash content of the subsample (Schlesinger & Hasey 1981), following
a loss-in-ignition approach. Organic C content was taken as 50% of
ash-free dry mass (Schlesinger 1977). This value was used as a fac-
tor to convert total dry biomass in each subplot to C. Standing dead
trees and coarse woody debris > 5 cm diameter were initially sam-
pled, but they were not included in the ﬁnal calculations because
their distribution in the ﬁeld has extremely heterogeneous, and at
least in some cases, it is likely to be associated with human redistri-
bution activities. Because overall this compartment represented only
c. 3% of the total C accumulated, their exclusion is unlikely to affect
our results.
The sum of woody (AGBt and AGBs) and herbaceous vegetation
represented
the above-ground standing biomass
C compartment
(AGB, Mg C ha1). Fine woody debris and leaf litter represented the
above-ground litter C compartment (AL, Mg C ha1).
The SOC stock was quantiﬁed by collecting soil from the top
30 cm. We collected three samples per plot using a soil corer of
10 cm in diameter and combined them to obtain a composite sample.
Samples were air-dried, sieved through a 2-mm mesh and analysed
for organic C (g kg1) using an oxidation in acid medium procedure
(‘Walkley & Black’, Nelson & Sommers 1996). This method was
selected to avoid any bias in the estimation due to the presence of
carbonates below 10 cm depth (Mazzarino et al. 1991), a common
feature of soils found in arid and semi-arid environments (Lal 2004).
We calculated soil bulk density by measuring the mass of dry soil
contained in a metal cylinder which measured 4.5 cm in diameter and
10 cm in height. The samples were oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h to
obtain the dry mass of the soil (Maynard & Curran 2008). No adjust-
ment for rocks or coarse fragments was necessary because the soil
samples did not contain any. SOC (Mg C ha1) in the 0–30 cm layer
was quantiﬁed by multiplying organic C content (g kg1), depth (cm)
and soil bulk density (g cm3). The use of a higher number of soil
subsamples per plot was not possible due to logistic constraints. How-
ever, the results obtained were within the range of those reported by
Bonino (2006) for the ﬁrst 20 cm of soil in the same study area and
ecosystem types, on the basis of a considerably larger sampling
effort.
Finally, we calculated total ecosystem C (TEC) by adding AGB,
AL and SOC.
FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
To estimate the relative abundance of different species and trait val-
ues in the different plant communities, we carried out a ﬂoristic sur-
vey of each 50 9 50 m plot at the peak of the growing season,
recording the identity and percentage cover (at 5% intervals) of all
plant vascular species present in the plot, according to the methodol-
ogy of Cabido et al. (1993) and Díaz, Cabido & Casanoves (1998).
Dominant species were selected as those that together constituted at
least 75% of the total community coverage, including woody and
herbaceous vegetation (Cornelissen et al. 2003; Pakeman & Quested
2007; Lavorel et al. 2008). Although in the case of tree species we
could have made BA calculations on the basis of d.b.h. obtained for
each individual tree, we chose to use cover because (i) it allowed
the calculation of functional diversity for the whole vegetation,
including the herbaceous component, and (ii) it avoided potential
circularity derived from using d.b.h. in the calculation of both func-
tional diversity and C storage. Species abundance thus corresponds
to the relative cover of each species relative to the total plant cover
in the plot, expressed as a percentage. The species included in the
study and their average covers across the study area are shown in
Table S3.
We selected six key functional traits that are known or expected to
affect ecosystem processes associated with C dynamics and storage.
These were LDMC (mg g1), LNC (mg g1), LT measured as tensile
strength (N mm1), leaf area displayed per unit of C, measured as
SLA (mm2 mg1), plant height (H, cm) and WSG (g cm3), mea-
sured as the ratio of the oven-dried mass of a wood sample divided
by the mass of water displaced by its green volume, following Chave
et al. (2005).

Plant functional diversity and carbon storage
21

Functional traits of all dominant species reported in this article
were measured in the ﬁeld following standard methodologies, on at
least six different healthy, sexually mature individuals (replicates) per
species (Cornelissen et al. 2003), or obtained from a plant trait data-
base of central-western Argentina (CORDOBASE, included in the
TRY global database, Kattge et al. 2011). The functional trait values
for all the species included in the study are presented in Table S3.
MEASUREMENT OF FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
COMPONENTS
To test the strength of the association of different functional diversity
components with C storage, we used the approach of Díaz et al.
(2007). This framework distinguishes three different generic compo-
nents of functional diversity, the dominant (locally most abundant)
trait values, the variety (divergence) of trait values and the abundance
of particular species.
Dominant trait values in each plot were expressed as the community-
weighted mean (CWM), calculated as the averaged trait value in the
community, weighted by the species abundance (Garnier et al. 2004):
CWMðtraitXÞ ¼
X
pixi;
eqn 3
where CWM (traitX) is the CWM for a X trait, pi is the relative cover
of species i in the community and xi is the trait value for the species
i. This metric represents the expected functional trait value of a ran-
dom community sample (Díaz et al. 2007).
Variety of individual trait values was expressed by the functional
trait divergence index (FDvar; Mason et al. (2003)), which basically
represents the variance in trait values, weighted by the abundance of
each species in the community, and is calculated as follows:
FDvar ¼ 2=p arctanð5VÞ and V ¼
X
piðln xi  ln xÞ2
eqn 4
where xi is the trait value for the species i and pi = ai/Σai, where ai is
the relative cover of the species i in the community (Pla, Casanoves &
Di Rienzo 2012). FDvar values range between 0 and 1. We selected
FDvar over other functional dissimilarity indices due to its relatively
simple calculation and interpretation, because it incorporates relative
abundance and because it has demonstrated good performance
(Mokany, Ash & Roxburgh 2008; Pakeman, Lennon & Brooker 2011).
We calculated functional divergence across multiple traits using the
multifunctional index FDiv, which quantiﬁes how species diverge
in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the centre of
gravity in the multi-trait functional space (Villéger, Mason & Mouillot
2008). We chose this metric because it is a close multi-trait analogue of
FDvar and has also been successfully applied to empirical studies with
general objectives similar to ours (e.g. Mouillot et al. 2011; Pakeman
2011; Navas & Fayolle 2012). FDiv should be closely related to com-
plementarity effects and is largest when functionally different species,
that is, with large trait differences, reach similar high abundances
(Mouchet et al. 2010). As FDvar, it can take values between 0 and 1.
All functional metrics were calculated using the statistical package
FDiversity v. 2011 (Casanoves et al. 2010). A summary of the vari-
ables used in the quantiﬁcation of functional diversity and C storage
is shown in Table S2.
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
AND ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES
To test for links between C storage and the different components of
functional diversity, we followed the sequential procedure proposed
by Díaz et al. (2007). We ﬁrst used simple linear regression analysis
to test for pairwise associations between C storage in different ecosys-
tem compartments and components of functional diversity. All the
variables that signiﬁcantly explained C storage in the pairwise analy-
ses were then included in multiple linear regressions analysis, follow-
ing a stepwise model selection procedure (Burnham & Anderson
2002), to select the best predictors of C storage in different ecosystem
compartments. Statistical analyses were carried out using the statisti-
cal package Infostat v. 2011p (Di Rienzo et al. 2011).
To test for the idiosyncratic effects of particular species, the abun-
dance (% cover) of each species was included as an additional vari-
able in the ﬁnal model. A particular species was assumed to have an
idiosyncratic effect on C storage (i.e. an effect not included in its con-
tribution to CWM or divergence) if the inclusion of its abundance
signiﬁcantly improved the predictive power of the model after signiﬁ-
cant CWM and divergence effects had been incorporated (P < 0.05,
SS type I). For species which have a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnal model,
the signiﬁcance (P) of the variable in the model was reported.
To avoid any possible effects of land use on C storage not medi-
ated by CWM or divergence, we evaluated the signiﬁcance of includ-
ing ecosystem type as an additional variable in the ﬁnal models
(P < 0.05).
Results
A number of individual components of functional diversity
were signiﬁcantly associated with C storage in different ecosys-
tem compartments (Table S4 and Fig. 1). Among leaf traits,
none of the CWMs (LDMC, LNC, LT or SLA) explained the
variations in C storage in the ecosystem compartments analy-
sed. The FDvar of LNC signiﬁcantly and positively predicted C
storage in all compartments except in the above-ground stand-
ing biomass. The FDvar of LT signiﬁcantly and positively
explained C storage in both the soil and the total C ecosystem
compartments, but not in the plant ones. Neither the FDvar of
LDMC nor that of SLA was signiﬁcantly associated with C
storage. Among stem traits, the CWMs of H and WSG signiﬁ-
cantly and positively predicted C storage in all compartments,
with the exception of the link between WSG and the SOC com-
partment, which was not signiﬁcant. The FDvar of the same
traits signiﬁcantly and negatively predicted C storage in all
compartments, except for the FDvar of H not being signiﬁ-
cantly associated with the above-ground standing biomass and
soil C stocks. The multi-trait divergence index (FDiv) signiﬁ-
cantly and negatively predicted C storage in all ecosystems
compartments, but its association with the C stored in the
above-ground standing biomass was not signiﬁcant.
Because the possibility existed that no individual leaf trait
but combinations of leaf traits (i.e. functional syndromes)
would explain C storage, we ran a multivariate analysis
(PCA) of the sites on the basis of their trait CWMs. The
results (Table S5) conﬁrmed our ﬁndings for individual traits.
The ﬁrst multivariate axis (PC 1) was mostly deﬁned by leaf
traits and spanned between predominantly ‘conservative’ and
‘acquisitive’ extremes. We thus tested the association between
the site scores along PC 1 (used as indicators of the predomi-
nant resource-use syndrome in their vegetation) and their C
storage in different compartments. We found no signiﬁcant

relationship. The second multivariate axis (PC 2) was deﬁned
by H and WSG. The scores of the sites along this axis, not
unexpectedly, were signiﬁcantly and positively associated
with C storage in all ecosystem compartments. These results
indicated that in this particular study no signiﬁcantly new
insight could be obtained using functional trait syndromes
(expressed by scores along multivariate axes); therefore, we
only used individual traits in the multiple linear regression
models.
When all those functional diversity components that signiﬁ-
cantly predicted C storage in one or more ecosystem compart-
ments were combined in multiple linear regression models,
only the single-trait indices associated with stem traits and the
multi-trait index were retained in the ﬁnal models (Table 1).
C storage in the above-ground standing biomass was best pre-
dicted negatively by the FDvar of WSG and positively by the
CWM of H. C storage in the above-ground litter was best
predicted negatively by the FDvar of WSG and H. SOC was
best predicted negatively by the multi-trait divergence index
and positively by the CWM of H. Finally, TEC was best pre-
dicted negatively by the divergence of WSG (negatively) and
the CWM of H (positively).
The incorporation of individual species abundance as an
additional
variable
signiﬁcantly
improved
the
predictive
power of the models of all C compartments with the excep-
tion of the above-ground standing biomass. Only one species,
the shrub Moya spinosa, signiﬁcantly improved the prediction
of C storage in the above-ground litter (P = 0.0168), whereas
the woody species Celtis erhenbergiana (P = 0.0307) and
Geoffroea decorticans (P = 0.0222), and the grasses Trichl-
oris crinita (P = 0.0068) and Gouinia paraguayensis were
found to improve the prediction of SOC. Same species,
excepting C. erhenbergiana, appeared as signiﬁcant predictor
variables in the TEC ﬁnal model (T. crinita, P = 0.0055;
G. paraguayensis, P = 0.0347 and Geoffroea decorticans,
P = 0.0431). We therefore included them in an alternative

soil and the total ecosystem stocks.
Discussion
This study is one of the ﬁrst to empirically and explicitly test
the links between different components of functional diversity
and C storage in woody ecosystems in the ﬁeld, using sites
with
different
plant
trait
community
composition
as
a
consequence of different historical and present management
regimes. Although our study did not involve manipulative
experiments
and
therefore
causation
cannot
strictly
be
claimed, our results show clear trends that can be discussed
in the light of current theory.
Our ﬁnal models showed that all major components of
functional diversity – dominant trait values, the variety of trait
values present in the community and the presence of particu-
lar species – contributed to explain C storage in semi-arid
Chaco ecosystems. Our ﬁndings also illustrate (in accordance
with Fukami & Wardle 2005; Vilà et al. 2005) the potential
of the study of spatial variation in functional structure driven
by anthropogenic use for the assessment of the C sequestra-
tion of real landscapes, particularly when other intervening
factors, such as climate, topography and soil parent material,
can be controlled.
We found that among the dominant trait values only H was
included in ﬁnal models as the best predictor of C stored in
the above-ground standing biomass and in the TEC stock,
with a positive relationship. This means that plots where land
management had led to the local dominance of shorter-
statured plants were associated with lesser C storage in
vegetation and soil. This is similar to the results reported by
Ruiz-Jaen & Potvin (2011) for natural tropical forests in Pan-
ama, and it is not surprising considering that height is a good
predictor of total biomass of the plants (Chave et al. 2005),
which directly inﬂuences the amount of C contained in both
the above- and below-ground portions of the standing vegeta-
tion and incorporated into the soil as litter at senescence (De
Deyn, Cornelissen & Bardgett 2008; Lavorel & Grigulis
2012).
WSG was also expected to have a positive effect on C stor-
age, on the basis of both theory (Chave et al. 2009; Moles
et al. 2009; Falster et al. 2011) and previous empirical studies
(Baker et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2005), and appeared to have

a signiﬁcant positive effect according to the individual regres-
sion analyses. However, it was not retained as a predictor in
the ﬁnal model. Having shown in the multivariate analysis
(Table S5) that height and WSG were on the same axis (PC
2), the signiﬁcant effects of WSD in single models could sim-
ply drop out of the multiple models due to correlation with H
(R2 = 0.66, P = 0.01). Additionally, it also could suggest that
the abundance of larger plants, which in this case are not the
ones with the densest wood (see Table S3), could be more
important than the WSG of the standing and decomposing
material in explaining C storage in these ecosystems.
Although leaf traits are known to be involved in the conser-
vation–acquisition trade-off and thus expected to be signiﬁcant
drivers of C dynamics, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relation-
ship between any of the individual leaf traits analysed – or their
combination – and plant or soil C storage. Therefore, in the
case of plant height, our ﬁndings supported our hypothesis (i)
that the dominant plant traits – H and to a much lesser degree
WSG – predict ecosystem C storage, in accordance with the
mass ratio model. However, we found no evidence in support
of our expectation that C storage increases with the dominance
of leaf trait values, which is symptomatic of a conservative
resource use syndrome. This discrepancy with expectations
could be due to the fact that we deliberately chose to keep all
sources of variation other than plant community composition
as constant as possible. As a result, all plots analysed shared
very similar climatic and soil parental material conditions,
leading to relatively small differences in terms of functional
syndromes (Wardle et al. 2004; De Deyn, Cornelissen &
Bardgett 2008). The fact that there was no sharp species turn-
over (i.e. ecosystem types were relatively similar in terms of
the identity of the dominant species) despite strong differences
in the relative abundances of such species points in the same
direction. Above-ground disturbance of the kind that produced
functional trait composition differences among these plots (i.e.
logging, livestock grazing) tends to alter relative abundances
rather than the functional identity of communities, especially
in areas with relatively long disturbance history (Bond &
Midgley 2003; Cingolani, Noy-Meir & Díaz 2005).
The variety of stem trait values, expressed as the FDvar of
WSG and H, best explained C storage in above-ground stand-
ing biomass, litter and TEC ompartments, but the relationship
was negative in all cases (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This was
mainly because the WSG or H value distribution in plots with
low divergence of WSG or H was concentrated towards high
values. In other words, plots with more homogenous WSG or
H were dominated by denser-wooded or taller plants, respec-
tively. Plots with higher FDvar had a more even distribution
of H or WSG and therefore lower CWMs of H or WSG. This
means that the effect of stem traits divergence on C storage
ultimately depended on their associated CWM.
The variety of leaf trait values, in particular that of LNC
and LT, was positively associated with C storage in the indi-
vidual regressions analysis. More than a direct effect of the
variety of leaf quality on C stocks, this could be related to
the fact that plots dominated by large trees that produce large
amounts of litter (the major driver of C accumulation accord-
ing to our ﬁndings) had a rich understorey with species with
highly contrasting leaf qualities. For example, both Justicia
squarrosa and Bromelia urbaniana are typical members of
the community in plots dominated by large trees. The leaves
of the former are about three times richer in N and ten times
less tough than those of the latter (Table S3), which contrib-
utes to increase the divergence of LNC and LT values,
despite the fact that these two species represent only a very
small contribution to either standing biomass (Table S3) or
litter (N. Pérez-Harguindeguy, pers. comm.). In any case,
none of the FDvar indices for leaf traits was retained in the
ﬁnal models. Multi-trait divergence, as expressed by FDiv,
was negatively associated with C storage. Therefore, we
found no evidence to support hypothesis (ii) which, on the
basis of the niche-complementarity model, stated that a higher
functional trait divergence in the plant community should be
associated with larger C storage in the ecosystem.
The fact that the ﬁnal models predicting C storage in most
of the ecosystem compartments were signiﬁcantly improved
by incorporating the abundance of particular species would in
principle suggest that species-driven idiosyncratic effects are
important, as suggested by several previous studies (e.g. Firn,
Erskine & Lamb 2007; Vilà et al. 2007; Delagrange et al.
2008; Potvin et al. 2011).
However, it is not clear whether the abundance of such
species is likely to be a causal driver of C storage, or simply
a response variable to the presence of particular functional
community structures. For example, M. spinosa is a signiﬁ-
cant predictor of C in the above-ground litter compartment,
however, considering its low abundance, relatively small size
and evergreen to semi-deciduous habit (Table S3), this species
is unlikely to be a major driver of litter amount or composi-
tion. The only species which appear abundant enough and
shed enough litter (or standing dead leaf material that gets
slowly incorporated into the soil) to have a potential effect on
C dynamics are the shrub C. erhenbergiana and the perennial
grass T. crinita. In conclusion, it is not clear whether any of
these species whose abundance helps predicting C storage in
some ecosystem compartments are causal factor in the C
accumulation process or – perhaps more likely in some cases
– only indicators of particular functional community struc-
tures (e.g. canopies dominated by large trees) that in turn
favour C accumulation. The experimental assessment of their
role, although feasible (e.g. using removal experiments), has
to be carried out on a case-by-case basis. In the meantime,
the abundance of these species can be used to improve the
predictive power of the models of C storage, especially con-
sidering that they are regionally common and easy to identify
in the ﬁeld. Nevertheless, models including only CWMs and
divergence indices still have enough predictive power (cf.
Table 1) and therefore can be used in those cases in which
for theoretical or logistic reasons the idiosyncratic effects of
particular species are to be excluded.
In synopsis, the stepwise modelling procedure applied here
to explore the relative contribution of different functional
diversity components – dominant trait values, divergence of
single traits and multiple traits, effects of particular species –

in explaining the variation in C storage in Chaco forests
showed that in all cases the combination of different compo-
nents resulted in models with signiﬁcantly larger explanatory
power. The relative importance of the different components
depended on the C stock analysed.
Very few other works have empirically tested different
components of functional diversity in natural ecosystems
(Thompson et al. 2005; Mokany, Ash & Roxburgh 2008;
Schumacher & Roscher 2009), and even less work has been
performed in woody ecosystems, which in general offer a
complex picture. For example, in boreal forests of different
composition originated by different natural ﬁre regimes under
similar
climatic
conditions,
communities
dominated
by
acquisitive trait values showed lower below-ground C storage
than communities dominated by more conservative trait val-
ues (Jonsson & Wardle 2010; Wardle et al. 2012). In natural
moist seasonal tropical forests, Ruiz-Jaen & Potvin (2011)
reported C storage associated positively with plant height and
leaf mass per area (the inverse of SLA) and negatively with
the variety of values of these traits. In neighbouring planta-
tions, in contrast, they found a negative association of C
storage with plant height and leaf mass per area and a non-
signiﬁcant association with variety of values of these traits.
Overall, these antecedents and our ﬁndings coincide in giving
less support to the niche-complementarity hypothesis than to
the mass ratio one, but also in highlighting the complexity of
mechanisms operating in the ﬁeld and their strong context
dependence.
Conclusions
Our ﬁndings suggest that all three major components of plant
functional diversity – the dominant trait values, the variety of
trait values and the presence of particular species in the com-
munity – contribute to explain C storage at the ecosystem
level.
The only dominant traits with strong explanatory power
over C storage were stem traits, especially plant height. In
contrast with other systems, we found no evidence of the
association of C storage with leaf traits involved in well-docu-
mented resource-use syndromes. This may be a general trend
of semi-arid forest ecosystems or a consequence of land use
not changing the resource base of the plots strongly enough
to result in important shifts in functional trait composition.
This aspect merits further study, including combinations of
contrasting climatic and soil resource conditions, as well as
different land uses under the same abiotic conditions.
Our ﬁndings suggest that variety of trait values is a relevant
component of functional diversity. However, because the
association of a larger variety of trait values with C storage
was signiﬁcant, but always negative in the ﬁnal models, we
found no evidence in support of niche complementarity play-
ing an important role in C storage capacity in these ecosys-
tems.
The conclusions of this study, clear at the level of Chaco
and other semi-arid woody ecosystems subjected to similar
climate and land uses, are to be taken with caution when
comparing ecosystems that markedly differ in resource base
as a consequence of different water availability, length of the
growing season or nutrient level in the soil.

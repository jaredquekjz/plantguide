The trait-based approach shows that ecosystem function is strongly affected by plant
functional diversity as reﬂected by the traits of the most abundant species (community-
weighted mean, CWM) and functional dispersion (FDis). Effects of CWM and FDis
individually support the biomass ratio hypothesis and the niche complementarity
hypothesis. However, there is little empirical evidence on the relative roles of CWM traits
and FDis in explaining the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in grassland ecosystems.
We measured plant functional traits in the 34 most abundant species across 24 sites
along a restoration gradient of sandy grassland (mobile dune, semi-ﬁxed dune, ﬁxed
dune, and grassland) in Horqin Sand Land, northern China. Thereafter, we calculated the
CWM traits, the functional divergence of each single trait (FDvar) and the trait dispersion
of multiple traits (FDis). We also measured the C and N storage in plant, litter, root, and
soil. Using a stepwise multiple regression analysis, we further assessed which of the
functional diversity components best explained C and N storage in the sandy grassland
restoration. We found consistent links between C or N storage and leaf traits related
to plant resource use strategy. However, the CWM of plant height was retained as an
important predictor of C and N storage in plant, litter, soil, and total ecosystem in the
ﬁnal multiple models. CWMs of speciﬁc leaf area and plant height best predicted soil
C and N storage and total ecosystem N storage. FDis was one of good predictors of
litter C and N storage as well as total ecosystem C storage. These results suggest that
ecosystem C and N pools in the sandy grassland restoration are primarily associated
with the traits of the most abundant species in communities, thereby supporting the
biomass ratio hypothesis. The positive associations of FDis with C storage in litter and
total ecosystem provide evidence to support the niche complementarity hypothesis.
Both functional traits of dominant species and traits’ dispersion in plant communities
could contribute to explaining total ecosystem C storage. Thus, single- and multi-trait
indices of functional composition play a crucial role in predicting C storage in sandy
grasslands.

Functional Diversity Affects Carbon and Nitrogen
INTRODUCTION
Accelerating declines in species diversity of terrestrial ecosystem
have greatly aﬀected ecosystem function (Butchart et al., 2010;
Selmants et al., 2013). Many components of species diversity
are used to access the relationship between biodiversity and
ecosystem function (Tilman, 1997; Díaz et al., 2007; Mace et al.,
2012). Increasing species richness may increase the space for
the functional diﬀerences among species that strongly aﬀect
ecosystem processes (Petchey et al., 2004; Casanoves et al.,
2011). The trait-based functional diversity, broadly deﬁned as
the value, range, and relative abundance of plant functional
traits in a given community, is widely used in exploring plant
community assembly (Bhaskar et al., 2014; Spasojevic et al.,
2014), ecosystem function (Suding et al., 2008; Mouillot et al.,
2011) and biogeochemical cycling processes (Conti and Díaz,
2013; Silva et al., 2013). Therefore, understanding associations of
plant functional diversity with ecosystem function and properties
can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms
of biodiversity eﬀects on ecosystem function. Depending on the
morphological, phenological, and physiological traits in response
to environmental changes, diﬀerent plant species diﬀering in
their ability to capture, store and input C and N to the soil, are a
major driver of C and N storage in terrestrial ecosystems (Knops
et al., 2002; Cortez et al., 2007; Cornwell et al., 2008; Carrera et al.,
2009; Conti and Díaz, 2013). Grasslands cover approximately
40% of the earth’s land area and store a substantial amount of
carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the terrestrial ecosystem (De
Deyn et al., 2008). However, the body of empirical evidence which
focus on the relationships between plant functional diversity and
C or N storage in natural grassland ecosystems is still lacking
(Cavanaugh et al., 2014).
Plant functional traits aﬀect ecosystem properties via their
eﬀects on plant growth, tissue quality, and resource use (Lienin
and Kleyer, 2012; Lavorel, 2013). Leaf dry matter content
(LDMC), speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), and leaf nitrogen concentration
(LNC), are three important traits of living leaves related to
their structural properties and tissue quality, which aﬀect the
plant growth rate and litter quality (Kazakou et al., 2006; Cortez
et al., 2007; Dechaine et al., 2014). Plant leaf with a high SLA
is associated with high C input through high photosynthetic N
use eﬃciency (Feng et al., 2008). Leaf traits with low values of
the LNC and large values of the LDMC is referred to as the
conservative resource use strategy, which leads to more C and N
accumulation in standing biomass and lower C and N releases in
litter decomposition (Kazakou et al., 2006; Poorter et al., 2009;
Freschet et al., 2012; Milcu et al., 2014). More consistent studies
have shown that the high-standing plants also oﬀer more biomass
and more C and N in the biomass and litter, thus contributing
directly to C and N accumulation in soil (Lavorel and Grigulis,
2012; Lienin and Kleyer, 2012; Conti and Díaz, 2013). Thus,
both the leaf traits and plant size have been linked to a series of
ecosystem processes.
Plant functional diversity is reﬂected by the traits of the
most abundant species (community-weighted mean, CWM) and
the variety of functional trait values (Butterﬁeld and Suding,
2013; Lavorel, 2013). Single-trait index of CWM showing the
dominant trait value of most abundant species was deﬁned as the
abundance-weighted mean trait for a given community (Violle
et al., 2007; Butterﬁeld and Suding, 2013). The CWM eﬀects may
primarily be attributed to the biomass ratio hypothesis (Conti
and Díaz, 2013; Lavorel, 2013). The biomass ratio hypothesis
(Grime, 1998) proposes that ecosystem function is mainly driven
by the plant traits of most abundant species which play key roles
in the response of communities to habitat changes (Lepš et al.,
2011; Bhaskar et al., 2014). CWM traits have been empirically
proven as the main factor in determining the ecosystem C storage
(Butterﬁeld and Suding, 2013; Conti and Díaz, 2013; Milcu et al.,
2014). However, recent studies have also reported that multi-
trait index of functional dispersion (FDis) has a strong eﬀect on
ecosystem biomass and C stock (Mouillot et al., 2011; Ziter et al.,
2013), supporting the niche complementarity hypothesis which
proposes that the resource niches may be used more completely
when a community is functionally more diverse (Tilman, 1997).
Higher function dispersion reﬂects an increase in resource use
complementarity among species in a plant community, which
directly leads to an increased C storage in plant biomass (Ziter
et al., 2013). Some studies have demonstrated that the mass
ratio and niche-complementarity hypotheses are not necessarily
mutually exclusive in explaining ecosystem function, and the
combination of both of them has shown to be in operation in
the natural ecosystems and increases the amount of explained
variation (Schumacher and Roscher, 2009; Mouillot et al., 2011).
So, examining the roles of both CWM traits and FDis in
explaining ecosystem C and N storage can provide some insights
into the mechanism of how plant functional diversity aﬀects
ecosystem function and properties.
Sandy grasslands which are characterized by sandy soils
occupy a large percent of the natural vegetation in the semiarid
regions of northern China (Li et al., 2009). Horqin sandy
grassland is located in the semi-arid area of southeast Inner
Mongolia and is notable for its severe desertiﬁcation in northern
China. However, as a result of annual precipitation ranging
from 350 to 500 mm, mobile dunes (MDs) can be naturally
restored to semi-ﬁxed (SFD) or ﬁxed dunes (FDs) after excluding
grazing disturbance (Zhang et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009; Zuo
et al., 2015). Plant height, species richness and biomass increase
with the vegetation restoration succession from sand pioneer
plants in MDs to low shrub communities in SFDs, then toward
annual herbaceous communities in FDs (Qiao et al., 2012; Zuo
et al., 2014). The previous study has shown that sandy vegetation
restoration may lead to the increase of C and N storage in the
ecosystem, in which the total ecosystem C storage increased
by 4.8 or 7.1 times from MDs to FDs or grasslands, and the
corresponding N storage increased by 15.7 or 20.6 times (Zuo
et al., 2015). However, little is known about the associations of
plant functional diversity with ecosystem C or N storage in the
sandy grassland restoration.
The objective of this study was to examine the relationships
between diﬀerent components of plant functional diversity and
C or N storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments along the
restoration gradient of sandy grassland. We also attempted to
identify the roles of CWM traits and FDis in predicting C and N
storage in the sandy grassland restoration. Speciﬁcally, we tested

the three hypotheses: (1) C and N storage in diﬀerent ecosystem
compartments could be predicted by the trait values of the most
abundant species; (2) plant community dominated by plants with
a higher investment in structure (such as high values of plant
height) has higher C and N storage in standing biomass, litter and
soil; and (3) the higher FDis correlates with the higher C and N
storage in biomass and litter, thus leading to the higher ecosystem
C and N storage in the sandy grassland restoration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site Description and Sampling Design
The study was carried out in southwest of Horqin Sandy
Land (42◦55′ N, 120◦42′ E; 360 m elevation), Inner Mongolia,
Northern China. The climate is a continental semiarid, with
a warm summer and a very cold winter. The mean annual
temperature is around 7.5◦C, and the mean annual precipitation
is 325.14 mm (data from the year 1991 to 2011 in Naiman
Desertiﬁcation Research Station), with 75% of the total in the
growing season of the months of June to September. Sandy
grasslands in this area are covered with native grasses, forbs and
shrubs. The annual forb, Agriophyllum squarrosum, as a sand
pioneer plant, is a dominant species on MDs (vegetation cover
is less than 10%). SFDs (10–60%) were dominated by Artemisia
halodendron shrub. FDs (>60%) were dominated by annual forb,
Artemisia scoparia and perennial grass, Cleistogenes squarrosa.
Grasslands (>60%) were dominated by annual forb, A. scoparia
and perennial grasses, Phragmites communis and Pennisetum
centrasiaticum.
Within the study area, we selected 24 sites from four typical
habitats (six replicate sites per habitat) along a restoration
gradient of sandy grassland, including MD, SFD, FD, and
grassland (G). Study sites were the same as those used in our
previous work (Zuo et al., 2015). SFD and FDs were derived from
MDs by fencing for grazing exclusion approximately from 1995
and 1980, respectively. Grasslands were excluded from grazing by
fencing in 1996. At each site, we established a 20 m × 20 m plot
(replicate) in an area with ﬂat topography (slope < 5◦). Then we
set up ﬁve 1 m × 1 m quadrats at the four corners and at the center
in each plot to carry out vegetation survey, plant traits, and soil
sampling. A description of the vegetation characteristics and soil
properties in diﬀerent habitat types is shown in Supplementary
Table S1.
Carbon and Nitrogen Storage
In each 1 m × 1 m quadrat, we recorded the species number and
plant cover. Above-ground biomass of each species was harvested
during the peak of the growing season, and then litter was
collected within each quadrat. After the litter layer was removed
in each quadrat, roots were taken from three core locations at four
depth increments: 0 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 40, and 40 to 60 cm using
an 8 cm-diameter soil auger. In calculating the soil bulk density,
four soil samples were collected from the same four depths in
each quadrat using a soil auger equipped with a stainless-steel
cylinder (5 cm in both diameter and height). Concurrently, we
also collected three random soil samples at each depth within the
quadrat using a 3 cm-diameter soil auger and they were combined
to form a composite sample for C and N content analysis.
Roots were washed and handpicked over a 1-mm screen
to remove soil, pebbles and debris. The aboveground biomass,
litter and roots were dried at a temperature of 60◦C for 48 h
and were ground using a mill (Pulverisette 14, German). Soil
samples were air-dried and hand-sieved through a 2-mm screen
to remove roots and other debris, and were ground using a soil
grinding bowl and rod. Plant and soil samples were analyzed by
an elemental analyzer (vario Macro cube, Elementar, Germany)
to determine the C and N content. Soil C and N content
at diﬀerent depths were converted to g C and N m2 by the
corresponding soil bulk density. The C and N content in plant,
litter and root were also converted to g C and N m−2 by the
corresponding biomass. We quantiﬁed C and N storage in the
standing aboveground biomass (AGB), aboveground litter (AL),
belowground root (BGR), and soil down to a depth of 60 cm, and
then calculated the total ecosystem C (TEC) and N (TEN) storage.
All C and N storage in the diﬀerent ecosystem compartments are
presented in Supplementary Table S2.
Plant Functional Traits
To estimate the trait values of diﬀerent plant communities along
the whole gradient, we selected the 34 most abundant species
(total 45 species) which accounted for 90% of the total biomass
in the sandy grasslands, including forbs, grasses, and shrubs. For
species richness, the forb life group dominated the four habitats
(Supplementary Table S3). Species abundance thus corresponds
to the relative biomass of each species to the total biomass in
the plot. We selected six key traits that are known to aﬀect
ecosystem function (De Deyn et al., 2008; Lepš et al., 2011; Conti
and Díaz, 2013), including the plant height, SLA, LDMC, leaf
carbon content (LCC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and root
density (RD). The ﬁrst ﬁve traits of 5–10 plants per species in each
quadrat were measured using standard methods (Cornelissen
et al., 2003; Kichenin et al., 2013). RD related to root biomass
was calculated down to a depth of 60 cm (Butterﬁeld and Suding,
2013). The functional trait values of 34 species included in the
study area are shown in Supplementary Table S4.
Function Diversity Measurement
We used two diﬀerent components of functional diversity: the
dominant trait values and the variety of trait values (Díaz et al.,
2007). The CWM expressing the dominant trait value in each
plot was calculated as the abundance-weighted mean trait value
for a community (Violle et al., 2007; Butterﬁeld and Suding,
2013): CWM (traitX) = 6pixi, where CWM (traitX) is the CWM
for X trait, pi is the relative biomass of the i-th species in the
community, and xi is the trait value of the i-th species. Functional
divergence (FDvar) was calculated to express the single-trait
divergence for a community (Conti and Díaz, 2013). We also
calculated FDis in order to express the multiple traits dispersion
within the functional volume of the community (Laliberté and
Legendre, 2010). FDis may be regarded as a surrogate measure
of functional richness and FDvar (Schleicher et al., 2011). We
chose the three indices of CWM, FDvar, and FDis in this study,
because they had also been successfully applied to empirical

studies with similar objectives (Butterﬁeld and Suding, 2013;
Conti and Díaz, 2013; Spasojevic et al., 2014). All functional
diversity indices were calculated using the statistical package
FDiversity v. 2011(Casanoves et al., 2011).
Relationships Between Function
Diversity and C and N Storage
We ﬁrst of all, used the correlation analysis to examine whether
C and N storage in AGB, AL, root, and soil was related
to CWM, FDvar, and FDis. Then, we used the linear (for
example, simple linear regression and log-transformation linear
regression) and non-linear models (for example, power and
exponential models) to quantify the potential relationships
between the total ecosystem C and N storage and the components
of functional diversity. Based on the explanation variation (R2) of
models, we found that simple linear regressions were straight in
showing how the components of functional diversity explained
the C and N storage in the total ecosystem. Finally, all the
variables that signiﬁcantly explained C and N storage in the
analyses of correlation and simple linear regression were included
in the multiple linear regression analyses, following a stepwise
model selection procedure, in order to select the best predictors
of C and N storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments (Conti
and Díaz, 2013). All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS (version 16.0). Abbreviations of habitat, functional trait,
functional diversity index, carbon storage and nitrogen storage
are shown in Supplementary Table S5.
RESULTS
Habitat changes, following sandy grassland restoration had
signiﬁcant eﬀects on six CWM traits, the functional trait variety
of LCC and the FDis (Table 1, P < 0.05). CWM of plant height
and RD increased along the restoration gradient of the sandy
grassland. CWM of LCC increased from MD to FD. CWMs
of SLA and LDMC in SFD were lower than in the other three
habitats and CWM of LNC in MD was higher than in the other
three habitats. FDvar of LCC in MD and SFD was higher than in
FD and grassland. FDis in grassland was higher than in the three
dune habitats, but there was no diﬀerence among the three dune
habitats. So, single- and multi-trait functional indices had strong
responses to habitat changes in the sandy grassland restoration.
A number of individual components of functional diversity
signiﬁcantly correlated with the C and N storage in diﬀerent
ecosystem compartments (Table 2). CWMs of height, LCC and
RD were signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with the C and
N storage in AGB, AL, BGR, and soil, while the CWM of LNC
was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with them. CWMs
of SLA and LDMC were signiﬁcantly and positively correlated
with soil C and N storage. FDvar of SLA was signiﬁcantly and
positively correlated with the C and N storage in BGR, and FDvar
of LCC was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with the C and
N storage in AGB and soil. FDis was signiﬁcantly and positively
correlated with the C and N storage in AL and soil, as well as the
C storage in BGR (Table 2).
We also found that FDis contained a great deal of
information from their single-trait and tended to represent
diﬀerent dimensions of functional composition (Table 2). FDis
was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with the CWM of RD
and FDvar of height, SLA, LDMC, and LNC, and was signiﬁcantly
and negatively correlated with the CWM of LNC. Within single
trait indices, the CWM of height was signiﬁcantly and positively
correlated with the CWMs of LCC and RD, and was signiﬁcantly
and negatively correlated with the CWM of LNC and FDvar
of LCC. RD was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with the
FDvar of SLA. CWM of LCC was signiﬁcantly and negatively
correlated with CWM of LNC and FDvar of LCC. CWM of LNC
was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with the FDvar of
height.

Functional Diversity Affects Carbon and Nitrogen
Single-trait functional diversity signiﬁcantly explained the
total ecosystem C and N storage (Figures 1 and 2). CWMs of
plant height, SLA, LDMC, LCC, and RD were signiﬁcantly and
positively associated with TEC and TEN storage, while the CWM
of LNC was signiﬁcantly and negatively associated with them.
FDvar of LCC was signiﬁcantly and negatively associated with
TEC and TEN storage (Figure 3). FDis was also signiﬁcantly and
negatively associated with TEC and TEN storage (Figure 3).
When all functional diversity components that signiﬁcantly
explained C and N storage in diﬀerent ecosystem compartments
were combined in the multiple linear regression models, the
single-trait indices associated with plant height and leaf were
retained in the most ﬁnal models (Table 3). C storage in AGB was
best explained positively by the CWM of height and negatively by
the CWM of LNC. N storage in AGB was best explained positively
by the CWM of height. C and N storage in AL was best explained
positively by the CWMs of height and FDis. C and N storage in
BGR was best explained negatively by the CWM of RD. Soil C and
N storage was best explained positively by the CWMs of height
and SLA. Finally, TEC storage was best explained positively by
FDis and the CWMs of both height and LDMC. TEN storage was
best explained positively by the CWMs of height and SLA.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to empirically
test the associations between diﬀerent components of functional
diversity and the C and N storage in sandy grassland ecosystems.
Our results had shown how plant functional diversity explained
ecosystem C and N stocks in sandy grassland restoration, which
could be extensively discussed in the trait theory of functional
diversity eﬀects on ecosystem function. Our results suggest that
the dominant species’ traits reﬂected by CWM are the important
predictors of ecosystem C and N storage; however, FDis is
only important for ecosystem C storage in sandy grassland
restoration. A combined eﬀect of the CWM traits and FDis is
the most important explanation for ecosystem C storage in the
sandy grassland restoration, supporting the ﬁnding that the mass
ratio and niche-complementarity hypotheses in combination
may explain ecosystem function and properties (Schumacher and
Roscher, 2009; Mouillot et al., 2011).
In the ﬁnal models, C and N storage in most of the ecosystem
compartments could be best explained by the CWM traits, thus
supporting the ﬁrst hypothesis that the trait values of the most
abundant species could predict C and N storage in accordance
with the mass ratio model. This is also consistent with other
studies that ecosystem function and properties are primarily
driven by the CWM traits (Schumacher and Roscher, 2009; Ruiz-
Jaen and Potvin, 2011; Conti and Díaz, 2013). The previous
study has shown that plant community-level traits may be caused
by changes in the dominant species with diﬀerent trait values,
changes in trait values within a species or a combination of
these two (Lepš et al., 2011). In our case, the relative diﬀerences
between CWM traits aﬀect C and N storage more heavily than
the trait dispersion within-community, due to the restoration

succession of sandy grassland vegetation. This is particularly
relevant when the community-level trait values are weighted by
the abundance of each species, and therefore emphasizes the
eﬀect of traits of the dominant species on ecosystem C and N
storage (Díaz et al., 2007; Conti and Díaz, 2013).
Not surprisingly, we found that the CWM of plant height was
included in the ﬁnal models as an important factor in explaining
C and N storage in the aboveground plant, litter and soil, as
well as total ecosystem, which supported the second hypothesis.
This is in agreement with other ﬁndings that the CWM of plant
height is one of the best predictors of ecosystem C storage
(Garnier et al., 2004; Lavorel and Grigulis, 2012; Conti and Díaz,
2013). Our results have suggested that the habitat where the
sandy grassland restoration has led to the local dominance of the

relatively higher plants is associated with more C and N storage
in the vegetation, litter, and soil. This may be based on the fact
that plant communities with higher plant height can lead to the
higher plant biomass, thus contributing to promote soil C and N
storage because of inputs of abundant litter at senescence in the
sandy grassland restoration.
We also found that both C and N storage in soil or total
ecosystem were positively correlated with the CWMs of SLA
and LDMC in sandy grassland restoration (Figure 1, Table 2).
However, in the ﬁnal models, CWM of SLA was one of the
two best predictors of soil C and N storage, and the CWM of
LDMC was one of the most important predictors of the total
ecosystem C storage. This is conceptually consistent with the
previous studies that leaf traits are known to have an exploitative
strategy with fast nutrient acquisition, fast growth and high
productivity, and thus are expected to be a signiﬁcant predictor

of C and N storage (Wright et al., 2004; Poorter et al., 2009). Our
previous studies showed that C and N storage in plant, litter, and
soil increased with vegetation restoration succession from sand
pioneer plants in MDs to low shrub communities in SFDs, then
toward annual herbaceous communities in FDs and grasslands
(Zuo et al., 2009, 2015). So, these results suggest that soil C and N
storage are likely to be linked with the dominant leaf traits of the
most abundant species in the vegetation restoration succession
of sandy grassland. Our results further suggest that what matters
the most to soil C and N storage is the relative abundance of
plants with high-standing and larger SLA in the sandy grassland
ecosystems.
The variety of leaf C content values were expressed as the
CWM of LCC and FDvar of LCC which separately had a
positive and negative association with C or N storage in the
above-ground standing biomass, soil, and total ecosystem in
the analyses of correlation and regression (Table 2, Figure 3),
while none of them was retained in the ﬁnal models. Although
the high C concentration in leaf may increase the leaf mass,
the litter mass is determined by plant growth or plant biomass
in ecosystem. In our study, this was also likely to relate to
the fact that habitats dominated by the higher plants with a
high C content in leaf had a large litter mass following sandy
grassland restoration. Thus, the direct eﬀects of LCC on C
and N storage might be reﬂected by plant height in the ﬁnal
models, as indicated by the high correlation between them
(r = 0.76, Table 2). The signiﬁcantly negative relationship
between the CWM of LCC and FDvar of LCC showed that
CWM of LCC increased, while the variety of community-
level LCC decreased, suggesting that the increase of LCC
in most species enhances plant biomass or litter mass and
thus favors soil C and N storage in the sandy grassland
restoration.
Multi-trait dispersion, as expressed by FDis, was positively
associated with the total ecosystem C storage in the ﬁnal model.
Litter C and N storage were also positively associated with
FDis. These results partly supported the third hypothesis that
plant community in higher FDis had a higher C storage in
litter and total ecosystem in the sandy grassland restoration.
This provides an evidence to support the niche-complementarity
hypothesis (Tilman, 1997), suggesting that plant FDis has also
an important role to play in the ecosystem C stock (Mouillot

Zuo et al.
Functional Diversity Affects Carbon and Nitrogen
et al., 2011; Ziter et al., 2013). This complementarity eﬀect
implies that the total ecosystem C storage is also likely to depend
on the functional characteristics of the constituent species in
sandy grasslands. Following changes in dominant species and
increase of species richness in the sandy grassland restoration,
niche partitioning or facilitation among species can lead to plant
communities with high functional trait dispersion. The high
functional trait dispersion in the community is likely to promote
litter production or accumulation, thus contributing to the total
ecosystem C storage. In our study, FDis is at least a good predictor
of the total ecosystem C storage as the best component of CWM
traits (Mouillot et al., 2011).
Functional dispersion had a signiﬁcant positive association
with N storage in litter, soil and total ecosystem in the correlation
and regression analyses (Figure 3, Table 2). However, N storage
in most components of the ecosystem was best explained by the
CWM traits in the ﬁnal models. Previous studies have shown
that N storage of these components in the ecosystem was mainly
determined by species composition (Epstein et al., 1998; Carrera
et al., 2009), litter quality and decomposition (Shaw and Harte,
2001; Knops et al., 2007). Therefore, the association between
the functional diversity and the total ecosystem N storage may
primarily be explained by the biomass ratio hypothesis rather
than by the niche complementarity hypothesis.
CONCLUSION
Our results have clearly illustrated the important roles of CWM
traits and FDis in explaining the C and N storage in sandy
grassland restoration. Our ﬁndings suggest that the two major
components of plant functional diversity: the dominant trait
values and the function dispersion in the community, can
contribute to explaining C storage at the ecosystem level. The
dominant traits with strong explanatory power over C and N
storage were plant height at community-level in a sandy grassland
ecosystem. Community-level functional traits with investments
in exploitative strategy linked to plant height and SLA were
proven to be important predictors of soil C and N storage, as

well as the total ecosystem N storage. The trait values of the
most abundant species in plant communities may best explain
the ecosystem C and N pools in the sandy grassland restoration,
which further reinforces the mass ratio hypothesis. Our ﬁnding
also demonstrates that the dispersion of functional traits aﬀects
the litter C and N storage as well as the total ecosystem C storage,
thus supporting that the niche complementarity also plays an
important role in the C storage capacity in sandy grassland
ecosystems. These results suggest that the mass ratio and niche
complementarity models are not mutually exclusive: they both
play an important role in the ecosystem C storage in the sandy
grassland restoration. Therefore, changes in dominant species
following habitat change deserve the most attention when C and
N storage is maintained in sandy grassland ecosystems. At the
same time, eﬀorts need to be made to modify the functional
structure of communities by selecting plants with wide niche or
trait ranges in order to increase the C storage in sandy grassland
ecosystems.

Multiple-use land management is an important aspect of sustainable forest management and requires strategies
that both promote sustainable fiber production and conserve biodiversity. Studies formally integrating these two
aspects of forest management are needed to develop silviculture prescriptions capable of maintaining the de-
livery of multiple ecosystem goods and services. Techniques used to suppress vegetation that competes with
young pine seedlings have become standard practice in the regeneration of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.),
but they can cause changes in plant community composition. We compared white pine performance to un-
derstory development under five vegetation suppression treatments within three experimental white pine
plantations. White pine performance was assessed in terms of basal stem diameter and the percentage of trees
reaching an age 10 height target. Understory development was characterized in terms of understory plant
functional composition using a complementary set of functional and taxonomic diversity metrics. Plantations
included one clearcut site and two sites managed under a uniform shelterwood system. Our results show that
after 10 years, plots treated with a single, second-season application of herbicide that temporarily suppressed
both woody and herbaceous vegetation favoured rapid white pine growth, increased pine canopy cover, and
allowed the understory community to recover towards a mature functional and taxonomic composition.
Repetitive suppression of either only herbaceous or woody vegetation caused major shifts in community com-
position that were still evident after 10 years. These shifts were due to the prevalence of competitive species that
formed dominant layers in these treatments. Impacts of treatments on tree performance and understory devel-
opment observed in this study have important implications for forest management. Some treatments might
create problems in the long-term by delaying understory maturation, while others appear capable of balancing
multiple management objectives.
1. Introduction
Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) has been historically one of the
most economically, socially, and culturally important tree species in
Eastern North America (Uprety et al., 2014). However, in the centuries
since European settlement, harvesting, fire and pest damage have
caused its steady decline (Beaulieu et al., 1996). Early efforts to im-
prove white pine regeneration using then standard silvicultural tech-
niques produced inconsistent results that generated poor growth and
low survival due to plant competition, white pine blister rust infection
(Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.), and white pine weevil attack (Pissodes
strobi Peck) (Hosie, 1953; Stiell, 1985). Although a move to a uniform
shelterwood system in the 1970s helped mitigate losses from white pine
blister rust and weevil (De Groot et al., 2005; Hannah, 1988; Ostry
et al., 2010), achieving successful white pine regeneration still remains
a significant challenge, largely due to the effects of competing vegeta-
tion. Consequently there is a need for research that focuses on methods
to mitigate competition (Carleton et al., 1996; Pitt et al., 2009).
Vegetation management has long been used to raise performance of
desired tree species and its direct positive effects on tree growth are
well documented (Pitt et al., 2016, 2015, Wagner et al., 2006). These
practices usually involve the suppression of herbaceous and woody
competitive species through herbicide application and/or manual re-
moval (Wagner et al., 2006; Wiensczyk et al., 2011), providing crop

trees with greater access to limited resources. Developing vegetation
management strategies for white pine is particularly challenging be-
cause successful regeneration often relies on both managing understory
environmental conditions to help mitigate weevil and blister rust da-
mage while maintaining light levels that do not overly suppress re-
generating seedlings (Hodge et al., 1989; Pitt et al., 2016; Stiell, 1985).
It can be difficult to predict the long-term outcomes that vegetation
suppression will have on complex and dynamic understory commu-
nities. Vegetation suppression can be detrimental to interior forest
species of the understory by altering community composition and
contributing to a loss of species and plant diversity (Gauthier et al.,
2015; Miller et al., 1995; Noble and Dirzo, 1997). Disturbances asso-
ciated with vegetation suppression can also provide colonization op-
portunities by freeing up space and increasing resource availability for
previously non-dominant opportunistic species (Balandier et al., 2006;
Davis et al., 2000). This may lead to the formation of a dense compe-
titive layer (or “recalcitrant layer”) that has the potential to limit forest
regeneration by preventing the colonization of more desirable, late
successional species (Mallik, 2003; Meier et al., 1995; Royo and Carson,
2006; Young and Peffer, 2010). The persistence of competitive species
could also lead to increased silvicultural efforts, and therefore costs, to
ensure success of the current crop and to initiate subsequent rotations.
For example, early dominance of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.)
Kuhn) can pose significant challenges to regenerating tree seedlings;
and once it dominates a site it is very difficult to eradicate (Griffiths and
Filan, 2007; Milligan et al., 2016). Since multiple-use land management
is a fundamental aspect of sustainable forest management (Wang and
Wilson, 2007), it requires management strategies that both promote
sustainable fiber production and the conservation of biodiversity
(Eriksson and Hammer, 2006; Spence, 2001; Work et al., 2003). It is of
central importance for land managers seeking to ensure the sustain-
ability and ecological integrity of commercial forests to have access to
research that address the potential trade-off that exists between these
two interrelated objectives so they can make informed decisions (Urli
et al., 2017).
This paper aims to compare understory development to gains in
crop tree performance under contrasting vegetation suppression treat-
ments. To explore this topic we took advantage of three experimental
sites initiated in 2000 to evaluate the effects of timing and duration of
vegetation suppression treatments on planted white pine survival and
growth. Our objective was to address the following questions: (1) How
do vegetation suppression treatments alter the trajectory of understory
development over time? (2) How do understory communities respond
to these treatments after 10 years? (3) What are the responses of com-
petitive species and interior forest species? (4) What are the effects of
these treatments on planted white pine performance? We used a trait-
based approach in addition to traditional taxonomic information to
provide a comprehensive assessment of understory community devel-
opment. This approach is particularly useful because it provides greater
comparability among geographically distant sites (Garnier et al., 2016).
Another aspect of our study is that it included vegetation suppression
treatments designed to isolate the response from removal of specific
understory components (i.e. suppression of either herbaceous-only or
woody-only vegetation). Only a few studies have looked at the response
of understory vegetation and crop tree performance to suppression of
specific competitive components (e.g. Little et al., 2018; Miller et al.,
2003) and, to our knowledge, none have been conducted in Eastern
North America.
Our intent is to identify vegetation suppression approaches and
intensities (i.e., duration of suppression in years) that provide adequate
resources for successful white pine regeneration in terms of stem dia-
meter and height, with minimal effects on understory plant community
composition. These results can provide an empirical basis on which to
develop vegetation suppression prescriptions designed to optimize in-
vestment both in the short- and long-term.
2. Methods
The study was conducted in three planted white pine sites – two in
Ontario, Canada (henceforth: Clearcut-ON and Shelterwood-ON) and
one in New Brunswick, Canada (henceforth: Shelterwood-NB). All three
sites are part of the White Pine Competition Study (Pitt et al., 2016,
2011, 2009). The sites were harvested using either one of two con-
ventional silviculture systems: clearcut or uniform shelterwood. Both
create conditions for even-aged regeneration, but the clearcut system
generally involves the harvest of all overstory trees from an area at one
time. The uniform shelterwood system consists of harvesting overstory
trees in two or more successive cuts, depending on the management
objective, with the primary intent of managing the understory en-
vironment – in the case of white pine, to mitigate damage from white
pine weevil and white pine blister rust (Hodge et al., 1989; Stiell,
1985). Site histories and characteristics of these sites are summarized in
Table 1; for more details on white pine response and ecophysiology
effects of treatments from previous investigations within these sites, see
Pitt et al. (2016, 2011, 2009) and Parker et al. (2012, 2010, 2009).
2.1. Study sites
2.1.1. Climate and soil conditions
Clearcut-ON (World Geodetic System; WGS 84: 46°42′44.3″ N;
79°22′14.4″
W)
and
Shelterwood-ON
(WGS
84:
46°43′50.7″
N;
79°22′46.1″ W) are located 2.2 km apart in the Great-Lakes-St.
Lawrence forest region (Rowe, 1972), northeast of the city of North
Bay. Shelterwood-NB (WGS 84: 46°24′30″ N; 66°04′26″ W) is located in
the Acadian forest region (Rowe, 1972) of central New Brunswick, near
the city of Doaktown. The Ontario sites had mean annual, January, and
July temperatures of 4.4 °C, −12.2 °C, and 18.8 °C, respectively, with
1574 annual growing degree days and 475 mm of precipitation from
May to September. The New Brunswick site had a similar climate with
mean annual, January, and July temperatures of 5.0 °C, −10.5 °C, and
18.9 °C, respectively, with 1559 annual growing degree days and
480 mm precipitation during May to September.
Both Ontario sites represent Ecosite G033 (Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources, 2009) and are typical of white and red pine-domi-
nated (Pinus resinosa Aiton) mixedwood forests. Shelterwood-NB is lo-
cated within the transitional zone between the Castaway and Bantalor
ecodistricts of the Eastern Lowlands Ecoregion and is classified as an
Ecosite 5 (Zelazny et al., 2007). Both Ontario sites have approximately
10 cm of fine loamy sands that overlay deep, medium- to coarse-tex-
tured sands, with a rooting depth of about 60 cm and no signs of
mottling or gleying. By contrast, Shelterwood-NB has less than 10 cm of
fine loamy sand soil underlain by formations of grey lithic and feldspar
sandstone (Colpitts et al., 1995; Loucks, 1962).
2.1.2. Site history
Prior to harvesting, sites were mature stands likely of fire origin
(approximately 86 years old for the Clearcut site and 100 years old for
the Shelterwood sites). Clearcut-ON was full-tree harvested in spring
2000 with subsequent manual felling of all remaining residual trees to
emulate a true clearcut harvest condition. No advanced regeneration
remained following harvest. Shelterwood-ON was partially harvested in
1999 following a prescription for the regeneration cut phase of the
uniform shelterwood system. This harvest left an overstory of high
quality Pinus strobus L. and Pinus resinosa Aiton, along with many sub-
ordinate stems of Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.,
Acer rubrum L., and Populus tremuloides Michx. that had been marked for
harvest but left standing due to poor market conditions. To achieve the
intended silvicultural prescription, these remaining marked
sub-
ordinate stems were manually felled in 2000 and removed with a
grapple skidder. The result was an overstory of relatively evenly spaced
dominant and co-dominant trees (basal area 18 m2/ha, 71% white
pine). In 1998, Shelterwood-NB was partially harvested for the

regeneration cut phase of the uniform shelterwood system. Like the
Shelterwood-ON site, the residual overstory was dominated by large
white pine, but these trees tended to be of lower overall quality (e.g.,
poor form) due to early white pine weevil damage (basal area 17.5 m2/
ha, 92% white pine). Post-harvest stand volume, basal area, and light
transmittance
were
similar
within
the
Shelterwood-ON
and
Shelterwood-NB sites, but more variable within Shelterwood-NB due to
the more irregular spacing of fewer and larger diameter residual trees.
To encourage natural regeneration, both Shelterwoods were mechani-
cally site prepared using chains pulled by a skidder. Site history, in-
cluding site preparation and planting details, are described in Table 1.
Seedlings at all three sites were initially the same size when planted
(Table 1).
2.2. Vegetation suppression treatments
The original White Pine Competition Study had 14 treatments
consisting of various levels and timing of woody and non-woody species
suppression, including a single broadcast herbicide treatment to
emulate operational practices (Pitt et al., 2016, 2011, 2009). Our in-
vestigation focused on 5 of the original 14 treatments (Table 2).
Herbaceous suppression in 4-yr herb-only and 4-yr herb and woody
treatments was maintained for the first four growing seasons after
planting via repeated directed foliar applications of 3% solution of
Vision® herbicide (a.i. glyphosate; see Pitt et al., 2016 for details).
Woody stem removal in 10-yr woody-only was achieved by basal bark
treatment using the herbicide Release® (a.i. trycolpyr) just before
planting. Subsequent woody stem regeneration was manually clipped
each year during the first ten years. The intent of these treatments was
to achieve the four different vegetation conditions as a 22 factorial
(Herb (0, 1) x Woody (0, 1)), and not test any specific operational
treatments or means of achieving these conditions. The 1-yr herb and
woody treatment was intended to emulate an operational treatment and
was achieved by a single broadcast application of 2% Vision® applied at
the end of the second growing season. This treatment targeted both
woody and herbaceous vegetation, with no subsequent follow-up
treatment. All herbicides were applied using Solo® backpack sprayers
with either 8004 nozzles for Vision® or SS1502 nozzles for Release®.

Each vegetation suppression treatment was replicated three times at
each site in a randomized complete block design. The original design of
the White Pine Competition Study also included an additional stem
density treatment that consisted of three levels of regenerating decid-
uous hardwoods (5000, 10000, 15,000 stems per hectare). However,
these density treatments were subsequently found to have non-sig-
nificant effects on understory vegetation and planted tree performance
(Pitt et al., 2016; p > 0.1), so these density treatments were kept as
additional replicates for vegetation suppression treatments in the pre-
sent study. Hence, vegetation suppression treatments were replicated
either three (4-yr herb and woody, 10-yr woody-only) or nine times (no
suppression, 1-yr herb and woody, and 4-year herb) (Table 2). Each
treatment was randomly assigned to an 18-m × 18-m plot separated by
at least 2-m corridors.
2.3. Tree performance indicator
Each treatment plot consisted of 9 rows of 9 planted white pine at 2-
m spacing. The inner 10 m × 10 m area of each treatment plot, coin-
ciding with 5 rows of 5 planted trees, was established as the measure-
ment plot. Basal stem diameter (5 cm above the ground line) and the
percentage of trees meeting or exceeding a target height of 2.5 m height
(henceforth: P250), a standard target height for a 10-year-old stand,
were used as practical indicators of planted pine performance (Pitt
et al., 2016). P250 and basal stem diameter was determined through
total height and basal stem diameter measurements of the surviving
planted trees and was measured at the end of the tenth growing season.
2.4. Vegetation survey
Non-crop vegetation was assessed during July or early August of
growing seasons one, three, six and ten from five 2 m × 2 m subplots
randomly located within each treatment plot. Cover (%) of all non-crop
vascular species was visually estimated to the nearest one percent.
Identification was done to the species level following the nomenclature
of the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN), with the ex-
ception of 13 genera (Actaea L., Alnus Mill., Amelanchier Medik, Aster L.,
Hieracium L., Lactuca L., Pyrola L., Ribes L., Salix L., Solidago L.,
Vaccinium L., Viburnum L., Viola L.) that were identified to the genus
level. Grass cover was pooled to include both grasses and Carex spp.
Total cover of natural conifer regeneration was assessed and appor-
tioned to each species based on stem density. We did not include cover
values of planted white pine in our analysis of plant community re-
sponse, as we were interested in the response of naturally regenerating
species to the competition suppression treatments.
2.5. Species traits
Plant traits were obtained from the TOPIC database (Aubin et al.,
2012) and from field observations. We use the term “trait” in its broader
sense, which includes morphological, physiological or phenological
features of the plant, as well as performance traits related to individual
fitness (Violle et al., 2007). Traits were selected for analysis because of
their relation to the competitive ability (Raunkiaer lifeform, maximum
height,
foliage
architecture)
and
colonization
potential
following
disturbance (lateral extension, seed weight, seed production, seed
dispersal distance, shade tolerance; Table 3).
2.6. Analyses
Analyses were designed to test for similarities in plant community
response and planted white pine performance to treatments across the
three study sites. We based the analyses on four distinct matrices to
answer our four research questions: (1) matrix L (plots by species)
containing cover data, (2) matrix Q (traits by species) containing mixed
species traits data, (3) matrix R consisting of ordinal variables
representing vegetation suppression treatment (Table 2), and (4) a
matrix containing pine performance (plots by performance indicator).
All statistical analyses and graphics were conducted using the open-
source statistical package R (R Core Team, 2017).
2.6.1. How do vegetation suppression treatments alter the trajectory of
community composition development over time?
To explore the effect of treatment on species composition over time,
we used the principal response curve method (PRC) (Van den Brink and
Ter Braak, 1999) on the L and R matrices. PRCs are a special case of
redundancy analysis (RDA) that uses a multivariate approach based on
constrained ordination techniques to test the interaction between time
and a given treatment (α = 0.05), relative to the change between a
given treatment and an a priori determined baseline for comparison.
Preliminary analyses found the two shelterwood sites responded
similarly to treatments, therefore the clearcut was analyzed separately
(see Appendix, Fig. S1). Prior to analysis, a Hellinger transformation
was performed on the L matrix (Legendre and Gallagher, 2001) using
the “decostand” function of the “vegan” package (Oksanen et al., 2008).
We considered treatment and year as factors. The no suppression
treatment was used as the a priori baseline for comparison. Since the
vegetation in this treatment was not disturbed, other than by
harvesting, it was considered the most appropriate baseline condition
against which to assess the impact of suppression treatments on
community composition. Significance for the overall PRC was assessed
using Monte-Carlo permutations (n = 999). To test for differences
among treatments in the 10th year, the PRC included a Tukey’s post-hoc
comparison of site scores, which were evaluated against a multivariate
t-distribution using the “multcomp” package (Hothorn et al., 2008). To
avoid bias introduced by multiple comparisons between treatments, a
Bonferroni correction was applied when significant effects were
detected.
2.6.2. How do understory communities respond after 10 years?
We used a complementary set of functional and taxonomic metrics
to assess understory response in year 10. To investigate how understory
functional composition is related to vegetation suppression treatments,
we first generated a Community-Weighted Mean (CWM) matrix using
matrix L and matrix Q. The CWM matrix was generated by calculating
the mean of the trait value present in the community, weighted by its
percent cover for each species (Garnier et al., 2004). We then conducted
a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the CWM matrix to relate
patterns of co-occurring traits to experimental treatments. Seed weight
and typical maximum height were both skewed in distribution and each
were log-transformed to obtain a normal distribution (Májeková et al.,
2016).
Taxonomic and functional diversity metrics were calculated and
compared between vegetation suppression treatments. Taxonomic di-
versity was measured using species richness (S; i.e. the number of
species per site) computed on matrix L. Functional diversity was cal-
culated using Rao’s quadratic entropy index (FD; Rao, 1982). Rao’s
index is calculated as the sum of pairwise distances between species
weighted by their relative abundance, and describes the variation of
species trait composition within the community. Using the matrices L
and Q, FD was computed as a univariate index (i.e. the mean value of
each trait FD). To asses the response of diversity indices between ve-
getation suppression treatments (i.e. alpha diversity) we used one-way
ANOVAs with Monte Carlo tests with 999 permutations, followed by a
Bonferonni post hoc test for multiple tests when significant treatment
effects were detected. FD Rao’s quadratic entropy were calculated using
the library ‘FD’ (Laliberte and Legendre, 2010). For computational
details and definition of CWM and FD, see Ricotta and Moretti (2011).
2.6.3. What are the responses of competitive species and interior forest
species?
We tested differences in the 10th year mean cover of competitive
K. Santala et al.
Forest Ecology and Management 432 (2019) 748–760
751

species between treatments for each of the three study sites separately
using one-way ANOVAs with permutations (n = 999) (Anderson, 2001;
Borcard et al., 2011; Legendre, 2007). Post-hoc pairwise t-tests were
used to test for differences between treatments. When significant effects
were detected with post-hoc tests, a Bonferroni correction was applied
to avoid bias introduced by multiple comparisons between treatments.
Eleven species in this dataset were identified as competitive species:
Acer rubrum L., Acer spicatum Lam., Betula papyrifera Marshall, Corylus
cornuta Marshall, Epilobium angustifolium L., Kalmia angustifolia L.,
Populus tremuloides Michx., Prunus pensylvanica L.f., Pteridium aquilinum
(L.) Kuhn, Rubus spp., and Grass. These species are known in Eastern
Canada for their ability to suppress crop tree survival and growth, and
for their potential to form dense “recalcitrant understory layers” that
can dominate the understory community and inhibit the colonization of
later successional species (Bell et al., 2011; Jobidon, 1995; Young and
Peffer,
2010).
Because
woody
species
were
actively
suppressed
throughout the experiment in 10-yr woody-only and 4-yr herb and woody
suppression treatments, we only included non-woody species (P.
aquilinum, E. angustifolium, and Grass) in the analysis for these two
treatments.
Ten species known to be typical of interior forest habitats were
identified in our dataset: Clintonia borealis (Aiton) Raf., Coptis trifolia
(L.) Salisb., Cornus canadensis L., Dryopteris spp., Maianthemum cana-
dense Desf., Mitchella repens L., Polygaloides paucifolia (Willdenow) J.R.
Abbott, Rubus pubescens Raf., Lysimachia borealis (Rafinesque) U. Manns
& Anderberg and Trillium undulatum Willd. These species tend to be
shade tolerant, less nutrient demanding, with known sensitivity to
frequent and/or intense disturbances (Avon et al., 2010). We were in-
terested in the recovery of interior forest species because there is a
growing interest in using management strategies and practices that
produce forest ecosystems that are structurally and functionally similar
to ecosystems that would result from a natural disturbance (Long, 2009;
Urli et al., 2017). We compared cover of species typical of interior forest
habitats among treatments as an indication that later successional
species are beginning to colonize the plot. These species have low cover
values therefore we used an average percent cover for all ten interior
forest species to test differences between vegetation suppression treat-
ments for each of the three study sites separately. One-way ANOVAs
with permutations (n = 999) were used for these analyses, followed by
a post-hoc pairwise t-test to test for differences between treatments
(Anderson, 2001; Borcard et al., 2011; Legendre, 2007). To avoid bias
introduced by multiple comparisons between treatments, a Bonferroni
correction was applied when significant effects were detected for post-
hoc tests.
2.6.4. What are the treatment effects on white pine performance?
To assess the effects of vegetation suppression treatments on white
pine performance, we tested for differences in stem diameter, cover,
and percentage of trees reaching year the 10 height target of 2.5 m,
between treatments. Each site was analysed separately using one-way
ANOVAs with permutations (n = 999; Anderson, 2001; Borcard et al.,
2011; Legendre, 2007) followed by post-hoc pairwise Bonferroni com-
parison to test for differences between treatments.
3. Results
3.1. How do vegetation suppression treatments alter the trajectory of
community composition development over time?
3.1.1. Clearcut – ON
A total of 19 woody species and 24 herbaceous species were identified
in the Clearcut site. Principal response curves for the site revealed that all
treatments led to changes in species composition over the 10-year
monitoring period when compared to plots that received no suppression
treatment (RDA axis 1 = 64.8%, F = 217.41, p = 0.01) (Fig. 1a). Time
explained 11% of the variance and the treatment × time interaction
explained 67% of the variance. Changes were most pronounced between
years one and three, after which composition remained relatively stable
until year 10 (Fig. 1a). Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant
differences between all vegetation suppression treatments relative to the
no suppression treatment (Appendix Table S2a, p < 0.001). The species
composition within 4-yr herb-only treatment developed differently over
time from that of the 10-yr woody-only, 1-yr herb and woody, and 4-yr herb
and woody suppression treatments (Fig. 1a, Appendix Table S2a). Positive
scores for Pteridium aquilinum, Grass, and Comptonia peregrina indicate
that these species benefited from conditions generated by treatments
consisting
of
10-yr
woody-only
suppression, 1-yr
herb
and
woody
suppression, and 4-yr herb and woody suppression (Fig. 1a). Populus
tremuloides became more prevalent in the 4-yr herb-only treatment
(Fig. 1a).
3.1.2. Shelterwood sites
A total of 32 woody species and 41 herbaceous species were identified
at the two Shelterwood sites. At these sites, all vegetation suppression
treatments altered species composition over time (RDA axis 1 = 52.9%,
F = 76.96, p = 0.001) relative to the no suppression treatment. Time
explained 11% of the variance and the treatment × time interaction
explained 33% of the variance. Like Clearcut-ON, changes in species
composition were most pronounced between years one and three

(Fig. 1b). Although the species composition of the treatments appear to
converge towards the a priori baseline for comparison (i.e. no suppression
treatment) over time, some significant differences between treatments
remained in year 10 (Fig. 1b, Appendix Table S2b). Plots receiving 4-yr of
herb-only suppression or 10-yr woody-only suppression were found to
differ significantly from the a priori baseline and from each other, whereas
1-yr both herb and woody and 4-yr herb and woody suppression treatments
did not (Fig. 1b, Appendix Table S2b). Species scores for Pteridium aqui-
linum, Diervilla lonicera, and Aralia nudicaulis indicate that these species
benefited from conditions generated by treatments with 10-yr woody-only
suppression (Fig. 1b). Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera became
more frequent throughout the experiment when compared to the no
suppression treatment and were more prevalent in the 4-yr herb-only
treatment (Fig. 1b).
3.2. How do understory communities respond after 10 years?
3.2.1. Clearcut-ON
The two PCA axes of the Community-Weighted Mean (CWM) show
trait distribution in relation to their relative importance for each
treatment (Clearcut-ON site: Fig. 2a; Shelterwood sites: Fig. 2b). For
Clearcut-ON, the first two axes explained 87.2% of the total variation
(Fig. 2a). The first axis clearly separates the treatments, with the no
suppression and the 10-yr woody-only treatments on the left and the
other treatments on the right. The no suppression treatment showed a
high prevalence of tall (HT), shade intolerant species (LI), abundant
seed producers (SDPRO), with small seeds (SDWT), and long dispersal
ability (DI). Geophyte ferns (Ra_gf) with erect stems (Fol_e) spreading
extensively though vegetative means (LE) were prevalent in the 10-yr
woody-only treatment. Multi-stemmed (Fol_mu), micro-phanerophytes
(Ra_mc) were also associated with this treatment. Traits associated with
the 1-yr and the 4-yr herb and woody suppression treatments included
large seed size (SDWT), shade tolerance (LI), short stature (HT), low
seed production (SDPR), and low dispersal ability (DD). The 4-yr herb-
only treatment tended to be associated with mono-stemmed (Fol_m) and
meso-phanerophytes (Ra_mg).
3.2.2. Shelterwood sites
The first two axes of the PCA explained 86% of the total variation
for the two shelterwood sites (Fig. 2b). Similar to Clearcut-ON, the first
axis shows a clear separation in treatments with no suppression and 10-
yr woody-only treatments on the left and the other treatments on the
right. Traits of species associated with the no suppression treatment in-
cluded tall (HT), shade intolerant (LI), abundant seed producers
(SDPRO), with small seeds (SDWT), and good dispersal ability (DI).
Geophyte ferns (Ra_gf) with erect stems (Fol_e) spreading extensively
though vegetative means (LE) were prevalent in the 10-yr woody-only
treatment. This treatment was also associated with multi-stemmed
(Ra_mu) micro-phanerophytes (Ra_mc). Traits associated with the 1-yr
and the 4-yr herb and woody suppression treatments included shade
tolerant species (LI) that produce few large seeds (SDPRO, SDWT), with
low dispersal ability (DI). The 4-yr herb and woody suppression treat-
ment was also associated with mono-stemmed (Fol_m) meso-phaner-
ophytes (Ra_mg).

3.2.3. Clearcut-ON
The taxonomic and functional diversity indices responded similarly
to the suppression treatments (ANOVA; Table 4). The taxonimic and
functiona diversity were greatest in the 1-yr herb and woody suppression
treatment (S:15; FD:0.53), no suppression and the 4-yr herb and woody
suppression (S:14, 13; FD:0.51, 0.52, respectively) treatments. The 4-yr
herb-only treatment had the lowest taxonomic (S: 8) and functional
diversity (FD: 0.15).
3.2.4. Shelterwood sites
For the shelterwood sites, taxonomic and functional diversity re-
sponses deferred from that of functional diversity (ANOVA; Table 4).
Plots that received no suppression, 1-yr herb and woody, or 10-yr woody-
only suppression treatments, had the highest values for taxonomic di-
versity (S:15.5, 13.5, 13.5 respectively). Plots that received 4-yr herb
and woody, and 4-yr herb-only suppression treatments had the lowest
taxonomic diversity (S:11 and 11.5 respectively). In terms of functional
diversity, the 4-yr herb-only, the no suppression, and the 1-yr herb and
woody suppression treatments had greatest values (FD: 0.49, 0.46, 0.44
respectively). The 4-yr herb and woody and the 10-yr woody-only sup-
pression treatments had the lowest values (FD: 0.31 and 0.38 respec-
tively).

3.3. What are the responses of competitive species and interior forest
species?
The no suppression treatment had greater cover of tall woody com-
petitive species (Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides)
than the 1-yr herb and woody treatments (Table 5). The 4-yr herb-only
and the 10-yr woody-only treatments also tended to have greater cover
of tall woody competitive species than the 1-yr herb and woody sup-
pression treatment (Table 5). Pteridium aquilinum cover was greatest in
the no suppression and 10-yr woody-only treatments (Table 5). Although
total cover of interior forest herb species was less than 5% in all sites
and treatments, interior forest herbs were found to have greatest cover
at Shelterwood-ON in the 1-yr herb and woody treatment (F4,28 = 16.93,
p < 0.001; Appendix Table S3).
3.4. What are the treatment effects on planted white pine performance?
There was a strong treatment effect on basal stem diameter at all
sites (p = 0.001; Table 6). The smallest stem diameters in year 10 were
consistently found in the no suppression treatment (22–30 mm). A mod-
erate diameter growth response was achieved at each site in the 4-yr
herb-only suppression, 10-yr woody-only suppression, and 1-yr herb and
woody suppression treatments. For the 4-yr herb and woody suppression
treatment, stem diameters were more than double those of the no sup-
pression treatment at each site (Table 6).
The percentage of trees reaching the year 10 height target of 2.5 m
(P250) was affected by treatment at each of the three sites (p ≤0.002;
Table 6). Only shelterwood sites had treatments that exceeded the year
10 height target for over 50% of stems. Plots with no suppression had the
poorest performance, with the lowest P250 across the three sites (5 to
21%). At the shelterwood sites, intermediate heights were achieved in
treatments with either 4-yr herb-only (31–59%) or 10-yr woody-only
suppression (36–59%). The highest P250 values were achieved within
the 4-yr herb and woody suppression treatment (70–97%; Table 6).
Overall, Clearcut-ON had the lowest P250 values (< 36%). At this site,
the greatest P250 values were found in the 4-yr herb-only (36%) and the
4-yr herb and woody suppression treatments (21%).
Treatments caused differences in the cover of planted white pine at
each of the three sites (p = 0.001) (Table 6). Plots with no suppression
had the lowest white pine cover values across the three sites (12–13%).
At the shelterwood sites, intermediate cover results were achieved with
4-yr herb-only and with 10-yr woody-only treatments. The greatest cover
of planted white pine was found in the 1-yr and the 4-yr herb and woody
suppression
treatments
within
the
shelterwood
sites
(37–54%)
(Table 6).
4. Discussion
In this study, we quantify understory response and white pine per-
formance to a range of vegetation suppression treatments that varied in
duration and intensity. By comparing three geographically distant sites
managed under two harvest systems, we were able to find common
patterns in response to the different treatments, allowing us to go be-
yond the limits of a regional context when informing silvicultural
prescriptions. We identified treatments beneficial for tree performance
and with minimal effect on understory community composition - a
central goal of current silviculture.
An ideal treatment would release white pine from competition while
allowing the understory community to recover quickly enough to
converge toward the functional composition of a mature forest. Within
the range of experimental treatments compared in this investigation, a
single, second-season suppression of herbaceous and woody vegetation,
which emulates current practices, was the most effective treatment in
these regards (Tables 5 and 6). This treatment in the shelterwood sites
provided white pine performance close to that of the more intense 4-yr
suppression of both herb and woody vegetation where virtually all
competition was eliminated for four growing seasons. Although it is
generally accepted that conifer performance is positively related to the
duration of vegetation suppression treatments (Wagner et al., 2006),
several studies have found, similar to ours, that an early one-time
treatment can produce comparable growth and performance in Picea
engelmannii, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana to those produced in sup-
pression treatments applied annually over several years (Biring et al.,
2003; MacDonald and Thompson, 2003).
Analysis of the trait distribution at year 10 (Fig. 2b) showed con-
trasting impacts of treatments on the understory plant functional
composition. The 1-yr and the 4-yr herb and woody vegetation sup-
pression treatments within the shelterwood sites had a greater pre-
valence of species with traits that included: shade tolerant, production
of a few large seeds, and low seed dispersal ability (Fig. 2b). These traits
are associated with interior habitats in several ecosystems (Dölle et al.,
2008; Knapp et al., 2016; Messier et al., 2009). The 1-yr treatment also
had higher taxonomic and functional diversity (Table 4). Several stu-
dies have reported that a single application of herbicide at initial stand
development in conifer forests has only minor short-term effects on
plant communities due to adaptation to disturbance-prone environ-
ments (Miller and Miller, 2004). Seed banks in the soil and crown, ef-
fective seed dispersal and re-sprouting ability, are all traits contributing
to the resilience of boreal forest species that can rebound quickly pro-
vided no other compounding disturbance follows (Hart and Chen, 2006;
Seidl et al., 2014).
By contrast, intensive, annual suppression of competing vegetation

for several years can emulate short intervals of multiple disturbances
that can have drastic effects on understory development (Donato et al.,
2009; Pidgen and Mallik, 2013). Multiple disturbances can exert a
strong filter on species capacity to survive, colonize and establish,
promoting the establishment of species that are adapted to disturbances
(i.e. fast-growing, pioneer species with small wind-dispersed seeds) to
the competitive disadvantage of interior forest herbs (Haeussler et al.,
2002). In our investigation the 4-yr herb and woody suppression treat-
ment was similar in terms of functional composition to the 1-yr treat-
ment, but had lower taxonomic and functional diversity (Table 4;
Fig. 2b). Several factors may explain the similarity between these two
treatments. Good survival and growth of large seeded white pine (Pinus
strobus) and red pine (Pinus resinosa) seedlings that performed well in
both the 4-yr and 1-yr treatments that provided suitable competition
free growing conditions. Greater canopy cover of planted and naturally
regenerating pine species found within this more intense treatment
(Table 6) also resulted in a rapid recovery of understory environmental
conditions (i.e. light availability and microclimate) that were more
suitable for interior forest species. Other studies have also found faster
recovery of interior forest species in previously harvested sites fol-
lowing canopy closure (Jones et al., 2012; Scheller and Mladenoff,
2002). Low taxonomic and functional diversity observed within the 4-
yr treatment may be the result of shifts in community composition in
response to environmental filters imposed by a reduction in light
availability that converged composition to a more functionally similar
community better adapted to these conditions (Mayfield et al., 2010;
Sabatini et al., 2014). These findings could have management im-
plications as there is a growing consensus that biodiversity can play a
key role in promoting ecosystem stability and resilience to disturbance
on the basis that more functionally diverse systems will be more likely
to compensate for the environmentally driven decline of other species
(Hallett et al., 2017).
Treatments that suppressed only one specific competitive compo-
nent, the 10-yr woody-only or the 4-yr herb-only suppression treatments,
appeared to cause major shifts in community composition. This was due
to the prevalence of competitive species that were favoured in these
treatments at the end of our 10 year study (Fig. 1, Table 6). We found
that Pteridium aquilinum tended to dominate treatments with 10-yr
woody-only suppression at all three sites, whereas the 4-yr herb-only
suppression treatment tended to be dominated by competitive trees and
tall shrubs, primarily Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Acer
rubrum in both shelterwood sites (Fig. 1, Table 5).
Other studies have also shown that suppression of non-woody spe-
cies increases abundance and cover of competitive woody species,
while the suppression of woody species alone typically favours the re-
lease of competitive herbaceous species (de la Cretaz and Kelty, 1999;
Miller et al., 2003). Minimal gains and some volume losses have been
observed in Pinus taeda plantations in the Southeastern United states
when either herbaceous-only or woody-only vegetation were sup-
pressed as a result of severe competition from remaining vegetation
(Miller et al., 2003). In contrast, reductions in mean growth were not
observed when either herbaceous-only or woody-only vegetation were
suppressed within Pinus patula and Pinus tecunumanii plantations within
a South African study because vegetation was never found to have
reached competitive levels in this study (Little et al., 2018). Dis-
turbances such as logging and vegetation suppression can increase co-
lonization potential by freeing up space and increasing availability of
light and soil moisture for opportunistic species (Balandier et al., 2006;
Davis et al., 2000). The establishment of competitive species into dis-
turbed areas, either woody or herbaceous, means that positive effects
on crop trees can be only temporary (Balandier et al., 2006). These
competitive species can then become a management problem them-
selves, by forming a recalcitrant layer, reducing not only crop tree
growth but also limiting successional development of the overall plant
community (Royo and Carson, 2006).
In the present study we also found high taxonomic diversity but low
functional diversity following 10-yr woody-only suppression in the
shelterwood sites (Table 4). Differences in taxonomic and functional
response to this treatment may be the result of intense light competition
from a dense fern layer that is limiting species composition to a more
functionally similar community (Mayfield et al., 2010; Sabatini et al.,
2014). We found the opposite response in the 4-yr herb-only suppression
treatment within shelterwood sites where we observed the lower
taxonomic diversity but the highest functional diversity compared to
other treatments. This difference in response could be the result of an
initial suppression of species that then allowed for recolonization of
species with more diverse functional types (Mayfield et al., 2010). Due
to the roles functional composition and diversity play in the regulation
and maintenance of key ecosystem processes, the use of these com-
plementary taxonomic and functional metrics can provide important
information on the potential impacts of vegetation suppression on the
long-term stability of ecosystem function (Chillo et al., 2018; Díaz and
Cabido 2001; Sabatini et al., 2014).
The release and dominance of P. aquilinum in the 10-yr woody-only
suppression treatment and the dominance of deciduous tree species in
the 4-yr herb-only suppression treatment are of particular concern be-
cause both can remain locally dominant for several decades (Balandier
et al., 2006; Douterlungne et al., 2013). Success of P. aquilinum as a
competitor is attributed to its extensive rhizomes containing consider-
able carbon stores, nutrients and dormant buds. Rapid growth allows
this species to quickly develop dense understory layers that compete
aggressively for light with other forest herbs. P. aquilinum also causes
the accumulation of a thick litter layer containing potentially phyto-
toxic compounds that can limit establishment of other species (Dolling,
1996; Milligan et al., 2016). By comparison, competitive overstory tree
species are considered one of the longest persisting competitive groups
(Balandier et al., 2006). Traits that make P. tremuloides, B. papyrifera,
and A. rubrum strong competitors include their ability to colonize
quickly through abundant seed production, effective resprouting
ability, and rapid juvenile growth that allows them to overtake neigh-
bouring trees quickly following establishment (Johnson et al., 1987;
Landhäusser and Lieffers, 1998; Lavertu et al., 1994; Safford et al.,
1990). The strong competitive nature of P. aquilinum and of deciduous
trees along with their ability to dominate communities for long periods
of time, suggest that beyond the challenges they pose at stand initiation,
they may create longer term issues that affect future rotations. These
changes in community composition can also cascade into changes in
ecological services and functions that these systems provide (Milligan
et al., 2016; Mori et al., 2017).
Although we did not attempt to statistically compare the two har-
vest systems (clearcut vs. shelterwood), we observed differences in re-
sponses to the treatments within them. The Clearcut-ON site remained
dominated by competitive, shade intolerant species, including P.
aquilinum, Grass, Comptonia peregrina and P. tremuloides (Fig. 1,
Table 5). In contrast, we observed a more rapid convergence of plant
community composition in the vegetation suppressed treatments at
shelterwood sites towards similar composition of the no suppression
treatment. Lower tree retention in clearcuts than in shelterwoods is
likely to affect understory development (Macdonald and Fenniak,
2007). Clearcuts are known to be colonized quickly by fast growing,
early successional species because these species can more efficiently
utilize newly available resources (Parker et al., 2009; Thompson and
Pitt, 2003). No suppression, 1-yr and 4-yr herb and woody suppression
treatments had higher taxonomic and functional diversity in the
clearcut site. However, white pine suffered from strong competition
combined with increased occurrence of weevil attack that resulted in
stunted height and poor form (Pitt et al., 2016). This suggests that
clearcut harvesting may be unsuitable for the effective regeneration of
white pine unless additional measures are taken to mitigate effects of
both weevil and competition (Hébert and Thiffault, 2015; Parker et al.,
2010, 2009; Pitt et al., 2016)

5. Conclusions
There is growing support in the literature that biodiversity can play
a key role in promoting ecosystem stability. Diverse forests can support
a greater number of ecosystem services (Hallett et al., 2017; Hisano
et al., 2018); can be more resistant to insect pests and disease (Carnus
et al., 2006); and can recover more quickly following extreme drought
events (Sousa-Silva et al., 2018; Van Ruijven and Berendse, 2010).
Furthermore, changes in functional composition in response to vege-
tation suppression can have a strong influence on key ecosystem pro-
cesses such as biogeochemical cycles, decomposition, as well as food
availability and habitat for wildlife and insect pollinators (Lindenmayer
et al., 2006; Sabatini et al., 2014). Since silviculture prescriptions will
need to be capable of providing sustainable yield while mitigating the
risks of climate change and evolving societal needs (Franklin et al.,
2018), studies investigating the impacts of vegetation suppression
practices on both crop tree productivity and biological conservation are
needed to improve management options available.
Findings from our study suggest a balance can be struck between
sustainable fiber production and conserving plant biodiversity within
managed forests. For regenerating white pine, management practices
that provide early release from competition and conserve enough ca-
nopy cover are necessary to favour white pine seedling survival and
growth
while
allowing
the
understory
community
to
recover.
Comparing the magnitude of change in understory community to gains
in crop tree performance will help identify future vegetation suppres-
sion strategies that manage competitive vegetation, minimize the ef-
fects on plant community composition, and enhance crop tree perfor-
mance. Our use of a complementary set of taxonomic and functional
metrics provides a mechanistic understanding of understory recovery
that may serve as an empirical basis on which to develop silviculture
prescriptions. The use of functional metrics also provides unique in-
sights regarding disturbance intensity that support understory recovery
in areas with similar forest composition and may also allow for future
comparisons (Scolastri et al., 2017). Forest managers could use this
information to define management objectives and create similar out-
comes using the tools available to them

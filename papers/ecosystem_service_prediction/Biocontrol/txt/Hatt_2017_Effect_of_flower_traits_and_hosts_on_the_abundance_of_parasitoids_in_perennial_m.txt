ABSTRACT 
Reducing the use of insecticides is an important issue for agriculture today. Sowing 
wildflower strips along field margins or within crops represents a promising tool to support 
natural enemy populations in agricultural landscapes and, thus, enhance conservation 
biological control. However, it is important to sow appropriate flower species that attract 
natural enemies efficiently. The presence of prey and hosts may also guide natural enemies to 
wildflower strips, potentially preventing them from migrating into adjacent crops. Here, we 
assessed how seven flower traits, along with the abundance of pollen beetles (Meligethes spp., 
Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and true weevils (Ceutorhynchus spp., Coleoptera: Curculionidae), 
affect the density of parasitoids of these two coleopterans in wildflower strips sown in an 
oilseed rape field in Gembloux (Belgium). Only flower traits, not host (i.e. pollen beetles and 
true weevils) abundance, significantly affected the density of parasitoids. Flower colour, ultra-
violet reflectance and nectar availability were the main drivers affecting parasitoids. These 
results demonstrate how parasitoids of oilseed rape pests react to flower cues under field 
conditions. Similar analyses on the pests and natural enemies of other crops are expected to 
help to develop perennial flower mixtures able to enhance biological control throughout a 
rotation system.

INTRODUCTION 
Conserving natural enemies in farming landscapes is a primary challenge for increasing the 
sustainability of agriculture. Indeed, natural enemies may help to biologically control pests 
and, thus, reduce the use of insecticides, which irrational uses have led to environmental 
degradation (Krebs et al. 1999; Gibbons et al. 2015) and may be harmful to human health 
(Baldi et al. 2013). Conservation biological control is defined as “the manipulation of the 
environment (i.e., the habitat) of natural enemies so as to enhance their survival, and/or 
physiological and behavioral performance, and resulting in enhanced effectiveness [in terms 
of predation and parasitism]” (Barbosa 1998). These habitats include woodlots, hedgerows, 
and wildflower or grassy strips introduced to fields, farms and landscapes. Because these 
habitats are less disturbed compared to annual crop fields, they provide a range of resources 
for natural enemies, including food, alternative prey or hosts, shelters and overwintering sites 
(Landis et al. 2000). 
There is clear evidence supporting that agricultural practices (i.e. mowing, pesticide use, 
harvesting) negatively affect natural enemy populations in fields (Colignon et al. 2001; 
Horton et al. 2003; Hanson et al. 2015) and, thus, the potential for biological control (Geiger 
et al. 2010). In most cases, wildflower strips (WFS) sown at field margins support a higher 
abundance and diversity of insects compared to adjacent fields (Haaland et al. 2011). Some of 
these insects are natural enemies of pests that are able to migrate to adjacent crops to control 
them, which reduces damage and potentially enhances yield and crop quality (Büchi 2002; 
Balzan and Moonen 2014; Tschumi et al. 2016). However, these beneficial effects may not 
always occur (Uyttenbroeck et al. 2016). One reason is the potential incompatibility between 
the natural enemies and the floral resource provided (Lundgren 2009; Tscharntke et al. 2016). 
As simply sowing flowers may not necessarily support the targeted natural enemies, it is 

4 
 
important to improve our understanding about how flowers affect their behaviour to enhance 
the efficiency of WFS to support these species. 
Flowers may be described through their traits, which are defined as “any morphological, 
physiological or phenological feature measurable at the individual level, from the cell to the 
whole-organism level, without reference to the environment or any other level of 
organisation” (Violle et al. 2007). Once a plant is considered in the context of the 
environment in which it grows, its traits may affect ecological processes. Consequently, these 
traits are termed as functional     a  and  a ido 2001; Lavorel and Garnier 2002), even 
though debate remains on the use of this term (Violle et al. 2007).    a  and  a ido (2001) 
showed that the range and values of functional traits carried by plants are strong drivers of 
ecological processes. Furthermore, different insect taxa may respond differently to a specific 
flower trait. For example, Campbell et al. (2012) showed that for the flower trait ‘corolla 
length’, long corolla flowers were visited by bumblebees Bombus spp. Latreille 
(Hymenoptera: Apidae), while flowers with short corollas were visited by hoverflies (Diptera: 
Syrphidae) and hymenopteran parasitoids. Many studies have explored the effect of one or 
two traits on insect behaviour in relatively controlled experiments (Patt et al. 1997; Vattala et 
al. 2006; Döring et al. 2012; Cook et al. 2013; Van Rijn and Wäckers 2016), or through 
modelling (Bianchi and Wäckers 2008). In field conditions, the effect of multiple flower traits 
was tested by developing small monospecific plots (Fiedler and Landis 2007a; Sivinski et al. 
2011). However, no studies investigated how traits of flowers incorporated in multiple species 
mixtures affect natural enemies whereas such mixtures are bought and sown by farmers. 
The attractiveness of WFS for natural enemies may also arise from the presence of prey and 
host species. They may help support natural enemy populations at field margins (Landis et al. 
2000), potentially retaining them there if they are more abundant than in the adjacent field 
(Rand et al. 2006). Thus, it is important to assess whether the presence of prey and hosts are 

5 
 
significant drivers of natural enemy behaviour in WFS, or whether flower traits alone are 
important. 
Oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus is an important crop in Western Europe. Pollen beetles 
Meligethes spp. (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and true weevils Ceutorhynchus spp. (Coleoptera: 
Curculionidae) are its main pests in spring (Williams 2010). Their natural enemies are mainly 
parasitoids – some being more specialists than others –, parasitising pest larvae (Nilsson 
2003; Ulber 2003; Williams 2003). With levels of parasitism which can exceed 50% (Ulber et 
al. 2010), finding ways to support their presence at OSR field margins may allow enhancing 
biological control. In the present study, we analysed how WFS sown within OSR crops 
affected the parasitoids of these two coleopteran pests by answering the following questions: 
(i) what factors affect parasitoid abundance in WFS (i.e. flower traits or hosts); and (ii) which 
flower traits are drivers? The results are expected to provide information on potential 
perennial flower mixtures that would enhance biological pest control in crop rotation systems. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Field set up 
This study was conducted at the experimental farm of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech (University 
of Liège), Namur Province, Belgium (50° 34ʹ 03ʹʹ N; 4° 42ʹ 27ʹʹ E). In a field of about 9 ha, 
five replicated WFS (125 m × 8 m) were sown, separated by 27 m (Fig. 1). Each WFS was 
divided into five equally sized plots (25 m × 8 m). In each plot, a different flower mixture was 
sown (mixtures A to E, Table 1). The layout resulted in a Latin square design with 25 plots. 
However, in the present study, only three strips (thus totally 15 plots, named 1 to 15, Fig. 1) 
were used. Four out of the five mixtures (i.e., mixtures A to D) sown in each strip were 
composed of seven flower species and three grass species (Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris 

6 
 
and Poa pratensis), while the remaining mixture (i.e., mixture E) only contained the three 
grass species (Table 1). The five mixtures were originally chosen regarding their value of 
functional diversity using the Rao quadratic entropy index described by Botta-Dukát (2005) 
(mixture A had the highest value while mixture E the lowest one, see Uyttenbroeck et al., 
2015 for more details). However the present study focuses on how flowers affect insect 
behaviour through their traits rather than through mixture functional diversity. All flowering 
plants were native perennial species commonly found in Belgian grasslands (benefits of such 
species, compared to exotic and/or annual ones were reviewed by Fiedler and Landis 2007b), 
used in Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) in Wallonia, Belgium, and available on the 
market (seeds were obtained from ECOSEM, Belgium). Each species was described based on 
seven traits (Table S1). Visual traits were (i) flower colour (i.e. yellow, white, violet), (ii) the 
ultra-violet (UV) reflectance of the peripheral part of the flower (numerical value indicated as 
‘UV periphery’) and  iii) whether the UV reflectance of the internal flower part differed to 
that of the external flower part (i.e. yes or no, indicated as ‘UV pattern’). Phenological traits 
were (iv) the month of the onset of blooming  i.e. numerical value from 1 to 12 with ‘1’  eing 
January) and (v) the number of blooming months (numerical value). (vi) Height (numerical 
value) was chosen based on its effect on insect flight (Wratten et al. 2003) and (vii) flower 
class was delineated after Müller (1881)  indicated as ‘Flower type’) because it notably gives 
the availability of nectar for insects that visit flowers (i.e. bee flowers, hymenoptera flowers, 
flowers with open nectaries, flowers with partly hidden nectar, flowers with totally hidden 
nectar, flower associations with totally hidden nectar). For each plant species, the values on 
the phenological traits and plant height were obtained from Lambinon et al. (2008), while 
those on the visual and nectar availability traits were retrieved from the TRY database (Kattge 
et al. 2011). The flower mixtures were sown on 6 June 2013 and the OSR was sown on 10 

7 
 
September 2013. During the experimental period, the WFS were mown twice a year, at the 
end of June and September.

Flower species monitoring 
Flower species and their relative cover were monitored on 17 and 18 June 2014. In brief, three 
1 m² permanent quadrats were laid at a distance of 6 m from one another in each plot (Fig. 1). 
Every flower species present in the quadrats was listed and its cover assessed. Plant 
nomenclature of Lambinon et al. (2004) was followed. Every month, the species that bloomed 
were recorded by visual observations following a 20 m × 2 m transect in each plot. To address 

8 
 
the effect of flower traits on parasitoids fully, only the flower species that were blooming 
when wasp abundance peaked were used for the analyses. 
 
Fig. 1 Field experimental design. The composition of the wildflower mixtures originally sown 
(A to E) is detailed in Table 1. Each plot (1 to 15) was then considered independent in the 
statistical analyses. 
 
 
 
 
Insect species monitoring 
OSR pests and their associated parasitoids were monitored for 11 weeks from 2 April to 25 
June 2014. In brief, a yellow pan trap (Flora®, 27 cm diameter and 10 cm depth) was installed 
on a fibreglass stick in each plot. Traps were positioned at vegetation height, and were filled 
with water containing a few drops of detergent (dish-washing liquid) to reduce the surface 
tension of the water. Their position was adjusted during the growing season to follow plant 

9 
 
growth. The traps were emptied and refilled every seven days during the survey period, and 
the trapped insects were conserved in 70% ethanol. Pollen beetles and true weevils were 
identified to the genus level following Kirk-Spriggs (1996) and Morris (2008), respectively. 
Parasitoids were identified to the species level following Ferguson et al. (2010). 
 
Statistical analysis 
For the data analysis (performed with R Core Team 2013), each plot (i.e., plots 1 to 15) was 
considered unique. We assumed that the sown replicated mixtures (i.e., mixtures A to E) 
could have developed to form different vegetation compositions. Therefore, 15 flower plots, 
thus 15 flower mixtures, were considered. For each plot, the average cover of each species 
found (i.e., both sown and spontaneous ones) was calculated from the three quadrats (the 
average cover of each blooming flowering species in each plot is given in Table S2). Then, 
for each plot, the Community Weight Mean (CWM, Lavorel et al. 2008; Laliberté and 
Legendre 2010) value was calculated for each trait based on the trait values obtained for each 
flowering species and their average cover in the plot  R function ‘d F ’, package ‘F ’, 
Laliberté et al. 2014). For numerical trait values, a single CWM value was obtained per trait 
for each plot. For class trait values, a single value for each class was obtained per plot. Both 
CWM values and the abundance of Meligethes spp. and Ceutorhynchus spp. were used as 
explanatory variables (details about CWM values in each plot are given in Table S3). 
The interactions between parasitoids and explanatory variables were analysed by considering 
only data when the populations of parasitoids reached their abundance peak in order to limit 
the random dilution effect of parasitoids in the different plots. Indeed, it was hypothesised that 
the effect of explanatory variables would be clearer on when parasitoid population was the 
highest. To do so, a forward selection of the significant explanatory variables was firstly 
performed, and secondly a redundancy analysis (RDA) was used. This method combines 

10 
 
multivariate multiple linear regression and principal component analysis (Borcard et al. 2011). 
The matrix of the CWM values and host abundance was the ‘matrix of explanatory varia les’, 
while the ‘matrix of centred response’ was the log10(x+1) transformation of parasitoid 
abundance in each plot (respectively the matrices X and Y in Borcard et al. 2011). Through 
the forward selection process  function ‘ordistep’, package ‘vegan’, Oksanen et al. 2015), the 
significant variables (P < 0.05) affecting parasitoid abundance were identified and those with 
the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) at each step were selected for inclusion in the 
RDA model. Based on the selected model, the constrained ordination between parasitoid 
abundance and the selected variables was obtained using Bray-Curtis distances (function 
‘capscale’, package ‘vegan’, Oksanen et al. 2015) and tested with a permutation test (n = 
1000, P = 0.05). Finally, correlation circles of significant explanatory variables were plotted 
to visualise how they were correlated with the parasitoid species. 
 
Fig. 2 Mean number (± SE) per trap in WFS and OSR of (a) Meligethes spp. and their 
parasitoids and (b) Ceutorhynchus spp. and their parasitoids along the trapping period. For 
Meligethes spp. and their parasitoids, the three last trapping weeks (from 11 to 25 June) are 
not included in the graph to facilitate the reading. Indeed, in the end of June, abundance of 
Meligethes spp. increased to reach, on 18 June, 1902 and 2444 individuals on average per trap 
in WFS and OSR, respectively, while abundance of parasitoids decreased. However at that 
time, crops were not sensitive to Meligethes spp. anymore. Details of abundance means for all 
trapping dates are given in Table S4.

RESULTS 
 
Flowers 
 
Fourteen flowering species bloomed during insect peaks, which occurred in May and June. 
Leucanthemum vulgare and Achillea millefolium were the most abundant species found in the 
different plots. Capsella bursa-pastoris and Medicago lupulina only bloomed in May, while 
Galium verum and Malva moschata only flowered in June. Aethusa cynapium, C. bursa-
pastoris, Matricaria recutita, Sinapis alba and Trifolium repens were not sown, but grew 
spontaneously in the quadrats (Table 1, see also Table S2 for details of each plot).

Parasitoids and hosts 
Five parasitoid species of Meligethes spp. and six parasitoid species of Ceutorhynchus spp. 
were trapped, representing 254 and 193 individuals, respectively. The diversity and relative 
abundance of the parasitoid species are presented in Table 2. In WFS, population peaks of 
Meligethes spp. and their parasitoids in WFS occurred simultaneously on 14 and 21 May (Fig. 
2a). The populations of Ceutorhynchus spp. and their parasitoids peaked on 11 June (Fig. 2b). 
On these dates, four parasitoid species of both Meligethes spp. and Ceutorhychus spp. were 
identified in WFS (Table 2). For each host, a second peak occurred at end of June. Despite 
parasitoids and their hosts occurred simultaneously in WFS, neither the abundance of 
Meligethes spp. nor Ceutorhynchus spp. affected the abundance of their related parasitoid 
species (Table 3, see also Fig. S1 for the abundance of hosts and parasitoids in each plot at 
their peaks). 
 
Parasitoid–flower trait interactions 
Instead, flower traits were the main drivers of parasitoid density in WFS. Indeed, flower 
colour, UV reflectance (i.e. both ‘UV Pattern’ and ‘UV Periphery’) and the availability of 
nectar  i.e. ‘Flower type’) were the traits that significantly affected parasitic wasps (Table 3). 
Meligethes spp. parasitoids Blacus nigricornis Haeselbarth (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), 
Brachyserphus parvulus (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Proctotrupidae) and Phradis interstitialis 
(Thomson) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were more abundant in mixtures dominated by 
yellow flowers, rather than mixtures dominated by white and violet flowers. Flowers with 
high UV reflectance for both internal and external flower parts were also more attractive to 
these parasitoids. Moreover, parasitoids were less abundant in mixtures containing flowers 
with totally hidden nectar (Figs 3a-b, Table 3). Tersilochus heterocerus Thomson 
(Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) generally responded to the opposite flower cues compared to 

14 
 
the other species (Fig. 3a). Ceutorhynchus spp. parasitoids Mesopolobus morys (Walker) 
(Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Trichomalus lucidus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) 
and Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), but not Stenomalina 
gracilis (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), were significantly less abundant in mixtures 
containing violet flowers and flowers with totally hidden nectar (Figs 3c-d, Table 3).

DISCUSSION 
 
Meligethes spp. and Ceutorhychus spp. parasitoids and their respective hosts reached their 
abundance peaks in WFS simultaneously in May and June, respectively. Pests, but not their 
parasitoids, showed a second peak at the end of June. However, at that time, harvesting of 
OSR was imminent and crops were not sensitive to the pests anymore. 
 
Effect of hosts on parasitoids 
Despite the simultaneity of their abundance peak, the density of Meligethes spp. and 
Ceutorhynchus spp. in the WFS did not affect the one of parasitoids. Instead, several flower 
traits had a significant role. Previous studies have warned that the presence of crop pests in 
WFS could affect natural enemy behaviour (Rand et al. 2006; Carrié et al. 2012). However, 
this study is the first to assess pest abundance in WFS as a potential explanatory variable for 
natural enemy density. It matters as Meligethes spp. are polyphagous feeders (Free and 
Williams 1978), thus may have settled in the WFS. Ceutorhynchus spp., however, are 
oligophagous on Brassicaceae and none of them were sown. Only S. alba was found 
flowering in June, certainly as a regrowth from previously cultivated crop. Nevertheless, even 
if OSR pests were trapped in the WFS, we previously indicated that they were always more 
attracted by the adjacent crops at their abundance peak, which shows that OSR pests did not 
prefer wildflower species (Hatt et al. 2015). Our results demonstrate that flower traits are 
stronger drivers at attracting parasitoids in WFS compared to hosts. An explanation is that 
parasitoids, at early stage of their adult life and before ovipositing, need energy they can find 
through flower nectar, which also increases their reproduction capacity (Lundgren 2009). The 
presence of attractive and suitable flowers may orient their flight when they start colonising 

16 
 
WFS. This confirms the importance of understanding which flower traits affect parasitoid 
behaviour in open fields and how. 
 
Traits affecting parasitoid abundance in WFS 
The abundance of Meligethes spp. parasitoids was significantly affected by flower colour and 
UV reflectance in the WFS. Visual cues have an important role in insect–plant interactions 
(Wäckers 1994; Begum et al. 2004). In the present study, yellow coloured flowers attracted 
more parasitic wasps compared to white and violet flowers. This result is consistent with that 
obtained by Jönsson (2005), who also found that yellow is a strong visual cue for pollen 
beetle parasitoids. The attraction to yellow is caused by the positive input from green 
receptors coupled with a negative input from blue receptors in the insect eye, termed the 
‘green–blue colour opponent mechanism’ (Döring et al. 2009; Döring et al. 2012). In contrast 
to Meligethes spp. parasitoids, Ceutorhynchus spp. parasitoids were less sensitive to flower 
colour. Only violet had a significant effect, repellent to most wasps. Yellow also attracts 
Meligethes spp. (Döring et al. 2012), which partly explains why it is one of the main pest of 
OSR (Williams 2010). Their parasitoids, also attracted by yellow coloured flowers, are more 
likely to find their hosts on such flowers. Thus, we hypothesise that flower colour is a main 
driver for pollen beetle parasitoids to locate their hosts. This phenomenon is not the case for 
Ceutorhynchus spp. parasitoids. Indeed, the majority of these species were not positively 
affected by any colour, with Williams and Cook (2010) also reporting that their parasitism 
rate is not affected by flower colour. 
In addition to colour, flowering species with high UV reflectance for both internal and 
external flower parts attracted Meligethes spp. parasitoids. Indeed, the UV reflectance of 
flowers affects insect behaviour (Chittka et al. 1994; Tansey et al. 2010). Yet, it did not affect 
Ceutorhynchus spp. parasitoids. This study is the first to assess the attraction of OSR pest 

17 
 
parasitoids to UV. However, pollen beetles have been shown to be attracted to flowers with 
higher UV reflectance (Döring et al. 2012), such as OSR (Ômura et al. 1999). Like the colour 
yellow, the attractiveness of flowers with high UV reflectance to Meligethes spp. parasitoids 
may help them to locate their hosts. 
After visual cues, nectar availability, which is linked to flower morphology, also influenced 
insect attraction. In particular, parasitoids search for sugar resources to increase their 
longevity and help to increase oviposition rate of females by accelerating egg maturation 
(Lundgren 2009). In the present study, the parasitoids of both Meligethes spp. and 
Ceutorhynchus spp. were negatively affected by flowers with totally hidden nectar. This result 
is consistent with all previous studies, which showed that hymenopteran parasitoids 
preferentially feed on flowers that offer accessible nectar, notably those with open nectaries 
(Idris and Grafius 1995; Patt et al. 1997; Vattala et al. 2006; Bianchi and Wäckers 2008). 
Jervis et al. (1993) reported that Ichneumonidae and some Braconidae species are generally 
too large and have mouth parts that are too short, which prevents them from exploiting the 
nectar of flowers with narrow and tubular corolla. In contrast, Proctotrupoidea species may 
feed on such flowers; however, in the present study, very few individuals of this superfamily 
were trapped (Table 2). There is a lack of information on the interactions between 
Pteromalidae species and flower corolla. In the present study, they were mainly negatively 
affected by flowers with totally hidden nectar, as were the majority of the studied parasitoids. 
 
Practical implications and further research  
Parasitoids were trapped at their adult stage. As mentioned here-above, flower nectar is an 
essential resource for parasitoid longevity and reproduction capacity, thus its provision may 
favour their ability of controlling pests. Nectar from OSR flowers may be exploited, however, 
the resource must be available at the latest when pests flight on crops in order to increase 

18 
 
parasitoid chance to find and parasite their host at the early stage of infestation. Because 
pollen beetles damage crops from their green bud stage, other source of nectar than those 
from OSR flowers must be available earlier. In the present study, OSR was even not blooming 
anymore when Meligethes spp. parasitoids occurred (i.e. in mid-May, simultaneously in WFS 
and OSR, Fig. 2a). The present results on the effects of flower morphology, colour and UV 
may be used in order to select flower species – among those blooming earlier than OSR – able 
to attract and support Meligethes spp. parasitoids at field margins before OSR flourishes and 
pollen beetles occur on them. In the present study, the first Meligethes spp. individuals were 
trapped on 23 April in OSR, three weeks before parasitoids peaked (Fig. 2a). As for 
Ceutorhynchus spp. parasitoids, they appeared in the field along with weevil adults (i.e. mid-
June, simultaneously in WFS and OSR, Fig. 2b). The presence of blooming flowers in WFS 
from which they may have benefited could have increased their longevity and foraging 
capacity in order to parasite weevil larvae in the following days in adjacent crops. Their 
simultaneous occurrence in both WFS and adjacent OSR may have favoured parasitism, thus 
pest control.  
By focusing on the effect of flower traits on natural enemies in cropping conditions, the 
present study may allow improving the constitution of mixtures sown at field margins or 
within fields. The sowing of WFS is subsidised by several European countries through the 
AES policy. The AES were firstly introduced to “reduce environmental risks associated with 
modern farming on the one hand, and preserve nature and cultivated landscapes on the other 
hand” (European Commission 2005). Today, there is a need to optimise AES to benefit from 
important ecosystem services, such as biological control (Haaland et al. 2011; Ekroos et al. 
2014). The results of the current study indicate that yellow flowers with high UV reflectance 
should be sown – if only they can bloom early in spring – while those with totally hidden 
nectar should be excluded to attract the parasitoids of OSR pests when OSR is cultivated. 

19 
 
However, in cropping systems following rotations (which is actually a practice in itself to 
control pests as it disrupts the presence of pest host plants through time, Oerke 2006), the 
challenge remains to develop flower mixtures that are able to support a wide diversity of 
natural enemies associated with the different pests of crops that are sown adjacent to perennial 
WFS. It could be proposed to sow annual flowering plants adapted to each crop each year, as 
some previously studied (Balzan and Wäckers 2013; Tschumi et al. 2015). Nevertheless, 
perennial WFS present the advantage of preserving permanent vegetation in annual cropping 
systems, providing an overwintering site and resources for natural enemies, thus, reducing 
ecological disturbance in agricultural landscapes and potentially favouring the early 
colonisation of crops (Rusch et al. 2013). Previous studies have shown that increasing the 
range of values taken by various traits within mixtures may optimise the conservation of 
several arthropod functional groups that provide multiple ecosystem services (Campbell et al. 
2012; Balzan et al. 2014). However, research is needed to determine whether flower mixtures 
with higher functional diversity support a wide range of natural enemies that are able to 
control different crop pests. Better knowledge on how flower cues affect different predators 
and parasitoids may help with the selection of appropriate perennial species for inclusion in 
mixtures. Similar analyses to those presented in this study, but on crops other than OSR, 
could provide such information. The present study provides first results, as well as a 
methodology, towards long term research on the development of perennial flower mixtures 
that are able to enhance biological control throughout a whole rotation period.

Supplementary materials 
 
Table S1 Theoretical trait values for each flower species. The values on blooming start, 
blooming duration and plant height were obtained from Lambinon et al. (2008), while those 
on colour, UV periphery, UV pattern, and the flower type were retrieved from the TRY 
database (Kattge et al., 2011). 
 
Table S2 Mean cover (%), calculated from the three quadrats in each plot, of each blooming 
flower species found. Sum of percentage may be less than 100 as grass cover and bare soil 
was also considered when assessing flower cover.  
 
Table S3 Community Weight Mean (CWM) calculated for each plot based on the average 
cover of each flower species found in the quadrats and blooming in May and June (see Table 
S2), and the traits of each species (see Table S1). CWMs of May was put into relation with 
Meligethes spp. parasitoids, while CWMs of June was linked with Ceutorhynchus spp. 
parasitoids, as these two parasitoids groups did not occurred at the same time in the 
wildflower strips.

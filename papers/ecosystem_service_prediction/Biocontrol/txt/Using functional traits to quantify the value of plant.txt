Summary
1. The loss of farmland biodiversity threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services delivered
within agricultural landscapes. The functional trait approach has been successfully used in grassland
systems to quantify trade-offs and synergies between services delivered directly by plant communi-
ties. Many of the services delivered by arable landscapes, however, depend on invertebrate consum-
ers, and the application of the trait-based approach to these systems depends on quantifying
functional relationships between trophic levels.
2. Two data sets of plant and invertebrate communities from a range of annual crops and uncropped
land habitats were analysed. The community-weighted means of plant functional traits were calcu-
lated for the vegetation samples and used as the explanatory variables in a multivariate analysis of
plant species composition across habitats. The constrained axes scores were used in statistical mod-
els to explain the variance in associated total invertebrate abundance, phytophagous invertebrates
and invertebrate numbers weighted by importance in the diet of farmland bird chicks.
3. The multivariate analysis discriminated between plant communities characterized by ruderal traits
(high speciﬁc leaf area and early ﬂowering) and those with more competitive traits. More ruderal
communities also supported proportionally more invertebrates. The suite of traits included in the
analysis explained a greater proportion of the variance in invertebrate abundance between uncropped
habitats, as opposed to between annual crops.
4. The overlap between the plant traits that respond to disturbance (functional response traits) and
those that affect the abundance of phytophagous invertebrates (functional effect traits) and the diet
of farmland birds demonstrates the potential for using common functional metrics to integrate the
assessment of an ecosystem service across different habitats particularly on uncropped land where
intensity of disturbance is the main environmental driver.
5. Synthesis. The quantiﬁcation of functional linkages between arable plants and the abundance of
their associated invertebrate consumer communities is the ﬁrst step in extending the trait-based
approach to quantify trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services developed in grassland
systems to landscapes dominated by arable crops. However, applying the functional approach to
in-crop weed communities and other service providers such as pollinators will require the incorpora-
tion of additional response and effect traits.

Introduction
The adoption of the concept of ecosystem services within the
scientiﬁc and environmental policy communities has high-
lighted a number of systems where current land use policy is
unsustainable in terms of balancing the suite of ecosystem
services they deliver (Luck et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2011;
Diaz et al. 2011). Nowhere is this more apparent than in agri-
cultural landscapes. Farmland is the largest land use type in
Europe but reconciling the need for provisioning services of
food and energy production with other supporting, regulating
or cultural services presents a signiﬁcant challenge (Zhang
et al. 2007; Power 2010). The non-provisioning services
within agro-ecosystems are largely delivered by non-crop
biodiversity that has suffered serious declines over recent
decades as a consequence of the intensiﬁcation of production
(Chamberlain et al. 2000; Stoate et al. 2001; Robinson &
Sutherland 2002; Storkey et al. 2012). There is concern that
the continued degradation of natural capital may threaten sus-
tainable crop production by, for example, adversely affecting
pollination services, natural enemy control of pest populations
and soil fertility and structure (Kremen 2005).
The use of plant functional diversity metrics to quantify the
delivery of ecosystem services and trade-offs between services
is increasingly been demonstrated, particularly for primary
productivity, support of livestock and nutrient cycling in
grassland systems (Vile, Shipley & Garnier 2006; Diaz et al.
2007; Lavorel & Grigulis 2012), and there is value in devel-
oping similar approaches in arable systems to reconcile con-
ﬂicting ecosystem services. Non-crop plant communities in
arable landscapes deliver a number of ecosystem services
directly, including reducing erosion through soil stabilization,
nutrient retention, climate regulation and puriﬁcation of water
courses by buffering against diffuse pollution by agro-
chemicals (Zhang et al. 2007). However, much of the focus
on ecosystem services in arable systems is on services
provided by the consumers of plant resources found in the
mosaic of farmland habitats. These include the regulating ser-
vices of pollination (Lonsdorf et al. 2009), biocontrol of crop
pests (Bianchi & Wackers 2008), weed seed predation (Bohan
et al. 2011a) and cultural services including the support of
farmland bird populations (Bradbury, Stoate & Tallowin
2010). An extension of the trait-based approach to modelling
the impact of change on these services requires the quantiﬁca-
tion of functional linkages between multiple trophic levels, of
which there are relatively few examples in the literature (de
Bello et al. 2010). Developing quantitative models of the
positive contribution made by noncrop plants in arable land-
scapes will be important for designing sustainable systems
that maintain regulating services without compromising the
main provisioning service of food, ﬁbre and fuel production.
The interactions between plants and consumers within ara-
ble systems have generally been based on qualitative associa-
tions between plants and consumers (Wilson et al. 1999;
Marshall et al. 2003; Holland et al. 2006) or community
approaches using food web algorithms (Bohan et al. 2011b;
Pocock, Evans & Memmott 2012). However, recently a num-
ber of studies have attempted to identify functional relation-
ships
between
taxa
either
using
functional
groups
or
characterizing
species
by
their
ecological
requirements
(Storkey 2006; Butler et al. 2009; Hawes et al. 2009; Brooks
et al. 2012). By adopting a functional approach, where
species are classiﬁed according to functional traits, rather than
relying on traditional taxonomic deﬁnitions, a better assess-
ment of multitrophic system responses to change could poten-
tially be made (Hawes et al. 2005). A functional approach
not only allows direct evaluation of the effects of change on
the functioning of the system, but also avoids the assumptions
that all taxonomic units are functionally equivalent and that
there is no redundancy in the system (Hawes et al. 2009). A
natural progression of this work is to develop models based
on continuous metrics of functional traits to link management
with ecosystem function via trophic interactions that are appli-
cable across contrasting species pools (Lavorel & Grigulis
2012). This functional approach is particularly attractive for
the quantiﬁcation of ecosystem services where service deliv-
ery can be independent of the species identity of consumers,
such as the example developed in this analysis – the provision
of chick food for breeding farmland birds.
The arable landscape is characterized by a range of habitats
ranging from regularly cultivated, cropped ﬁelds to less inten-
sively managed ﬁeld margins and areas of uncropped land.
These contrasting habitats represent a gradient of disturbance
from ﬁeld centres to margins and boundaries. It would be
expected that the ﬂoras adapted to these contrasting habitats
will exhibit a continuum of functional traits in response to
these gradients that represent trade-offs in plant ecological
strategy (Grime et al. 1997; Westoby 1998; Storkey, Moss &
Cussans 2010; Pakeman 2011). As arable landscapes are gen-
erally characterized by high fertility, it would be expected that
the main contrast would be between ruderal and competitor
strategies
(sensu
Grime
1974).
Species
found
in
more
disturbed environments will be characterized by ruderal traits
including high speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate,
shorter development times and small seed size (often reﬂected
in the production of large numbers of seed). Land that is no
longer regularly cultivated will be expected to have a peren-
nial community of species characterized by taller stature and
later ﬂowering. A number of the functional traits that mediate
response to disturbance have also been related in the litera-
ture to the palatability of plants to invertebrate herbivores –
speciﬁcally leaf traits associated with the trade-off between
resource acquisition and conservation (Perez-Harguindeguy
et al. 2003). It can be hypothesized therefore that there will
be an overlap between the suite of functional traits that
respond to disturbance and fertility and those that determine
the value of the plant community to invertebrate herbivores
(Lavorel & Garnier 2002).
Two large-scale experiments over multiple sites and years,
which sampled plant and invertebrate assemblages in arable
landscapes in the UK, have recently been completed. The

crops
(Firbank
et al.
2003),
focussed on cropped ﬁelds and the second, Farm4Bio (Hol-
land et al. 2007), on different areas of uncropped land man-
aged as wildlife habitats. When combined, they represent a
unique resource for validating the functional approach to
model the management
plant and invertebrate community
ecosystem service pathway within arable landscapes. These
data were used to test three hypotheses: (i) within the arable
ﬂora, adapted to environments along a gradient of distur-
bance, trade-offs between ruderal and competitor traits can be
identiﬁed, (ii) contrasting management in the arable landscape
has selected for communities along this trade-off gradient; this
selection pressure was expected to be less evident between
the annual crops in the FSE than between uncropped habitats
in Farm4Bio that have more variation in their levels of distur-
bance and (iii) these functional gradients effect the abundance
of invertebrate consumers used by farmland birds as a
resource for brood rearing.
Materials and methods
DATA SETS
The FSE (Firbank et al. 2003) was conducted across the UK from
2000 to 2003 on sugar and fodder beet (65 sites), spring oilseed rape
(67 sites), forage maize (68 sites) and winter oilseed rape (68 sites).
The aim was to investigate the potential impact of the management of
genetically modiﬁed herbicide-tolerant crops on farmland biodiversity
relative to conventional practice (Squire et al. 2003). Each ﬁeld was
divided into two halves, and the treatments (GM or Conventional)
were randomly allocated to each. Conventional management was
monitored, and an audit of all inputs demonstrated consistency with
current commercial practice for each crop (Champion et al. 2003).
The non-crop ﬂoras and associated consumer communities were mea-
sured using the abundance of all weed species and a wide range of
invertebrates. The biomass of weed species was assessed in the month
before harvest, in 1 9 1 m quadrats located at 2 m and 32 m from
the crop edge along 12 transects in each half-ﬁeld. All weeds that
were rooted within the quadrat were cut at ground level, sorted into
species and oven-dried at 80 °C for 24 h before being weighed
(Heard et al. 2003). Invertebrates were sampled from the weed vege-
tation below the crop using a Vortis suction sampler. Samples con-
sisted of ﬁve 10-s ‘sucks’ taken 1 m apart at 2 m and 32 m from the
crop edge at each of three locations around each half-ﬁeld in June
and August, giving a total sampled area of 0.09 m2 (Haughton et al.
2003). For the purposes of this analysis, only data from the conven-
tional half-ﬁelds were used, representing the mean weed biomass m2
and invertebrate numbers m2 at the half-ﬁeld scale.
The Farm4Bio project was established to quantify the effect of the
scale, quality and arrangement of uncropped land on biodiversity in
agro-ecosystems (Holland et al. 2007). Fourteen farms were chosen
in each of two regions in England (south-west and south-east) and a
contiguous 100-ha study area within each farm identiﬁed. Within the
study area of eight farms in each region, wildlife habitats were estab-
lished on uncropped land at different scales and arrangements. These
habitats consisted of four distinct areas with different management: (i)
annually established seed mix based on a cereal and a brassica to
encourage wild birds (wild bird cover, WBC), (ii) a perennial seed
mix to provide ﬂowering resources (ﬂoristically enhanced grass,
FEG), (iii) annually established seed mix to encourage food for farm-
land bird chicks (insect rich cover, IRC) and (iv) natural regeneration
of the naturally occurring arable ﬂora (NR). The habitats were sown
in 4 years from 2007 to 2010, but 2007 was excluded from this anal-
ysis because of very poor plant establishment in that year. In the
remaining six farms, two of which were managed organically, no pre-
scriptions were made for the management of uncropped land that was
largely made up of 6-m grass buffer strips. The vegetation in each of
the
four
habitats
and
on
equivalent
areas
of
farmer-managed
uncropped land was assessed in June/July in each year by recording
the presence/absence of all species in 12 0.71 9 0.71 m quadrats
positioned along a 100-m transect and estimating total percentage
cover. Vortis samples were taken in June/early July using a modiﬁed
nozzle that was placed over the vegetation and held for 5 s in each of
15 subsampling locations (giving a total sample area of 0.47 m2)
positioned along each of the four habitats or equivalent farmer-man-
aged uncropped land.
SELECTION OF TRAITS
Plant functional traits were selected for the analysis based on the liter-
ature of functional responses to management in agricultural systems
and links with consumers identiﬁed in the literature (Hawes et al.
2009; Pakeman 2011; Brooks et al. 2012):
1 Number of cotyledons (monocots = 1 and dicots = 0); monocots
and dicots have different effect traits (structure and resource quality)
and different responses to management (Heard et al. 2003).
2 Annuality and life-form (annuals = 0, herbaceous perennials
= 0.333, rhizomatous perennials = 0.667 and woody perennials = 1).
3 Development rate (month of ﬁrst ﬂowering).
4 Duration of ﬂowering (in months); both timing and duration of
ﬂowering affect a plant’s response to the timing and frequency of dis-
turbance and determine the phasing and quality of resources available
to higher trophic levels.
5 Speciﬁc leaf area (SLA mm2 mg1).
6 Leaf dry matter content (LDMC, mg g1).
7 Ln seed mass, which affects fecundity and ability to compete with
established vegetation.
8 Maximum height (cm) as an approximation for plant architecture,
shade tolerance and apparency to herbivores.
An upper limit to maximum height was set at 200 cm to allow the
inclusion of trees and shrubs in the analysis, which were often present
in the data bases as seedlings. Values for all traits were obtained for
all species identiﬁed across both data sets. The values for SLA and
LDMC were obtained from the LEDA trait data base (Kleyer et al.
2008), seed weight from the seed data base held at Kew gardens, UK
(Flynn, Turner & Dickie 2004), and the remaining traits from the
Ecoﬂora data base (Fitter & Peat 1994) supplemented by Clapham,
Tutin & Moore (1989).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The matrix of species x the eight traits was ﬁrst analysed to identify
trade-offs between traits in the UK arable ﬂora and to test the hypothe-
sis that species in the data base represent a spectrum of plant ecological
strategies from more ruderal to more competitive. Variance in trait val-
ues between species were standardized to zero mean and unit standard
deviation to give them all equal weight in the analysis before perform-
ing a Principal Components Analysis (PCA), using the CANOCO V4.5

program (Ter Braak & Šmilauer 2002); the trait values were used as
the ‘species’ data. For the purposes of this study, it was assumed that
the differences in functional effect traits on invertebrate abundance
were mediated through the mean traits in the community as opposed to
the range of traits (Violle et al. 2007; Lavorel & Grigulis 2012). For
each vegetation sample in the two data sets, the community-weighted
mean for the eight traits was calculated using the relative biomass of
the component species in the community. In the case of the Farm4Bio
samples, a measure of relative abundance was calculated as the number
of quadrats, in which a species was recorded divided by the total num-
ber of records of all species along a given transect. Although this could
not be regarded as a direct proxy for relative biomass (which would
have been a preferable measure for the analysis), it was effective in
identifying the dominant species in each sample.
To test the second hypothesis that contrasting management (differ-
ent crop type in the FSE or habitat in Farm4Bio) had selected for
plant communities along this gradient of plant strategy, a Canonical
Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed on the raw data sets
of ﬁeld-scale species biomass, in each data set separately, using the
CANOCO V4.5 program (after ﬁrst performing a DCA to quantify the
length of gradient and conﬁrm that a unimodal model was appropri-
ate). The analysis was constrained using the community-weighted
mean values of the eight traits for each of the samples and the signiﬁ-
cance of the ﬁrst two axes tested using a permutation test. Forward
selection was used to identify the traits that explained the most vari-
ance between the samples. Habitat type was included as a supplemen-
tary
environmental
variable
and
projected
passively
onto
the
ordination space.
The PCA analysis of the arable plant trait data base identiﬁed strong
colinearity between several traits including a negative correlation
between SLA and LDMC and time to ﬁrst ﬂowering and duration of
ﬂowering. Rather than attempt to quantify relationships between inver-
tebrate abundance and individual traits, therefore, to test the third
hypothesis (that invertebrate abundance responded to variance in the
functional composition of plant communities), models were run using
the axes scores from the CCA analysis as the explanatory variables. In
this way, the effect of contrasts between samples in suites of correlated
traits on invertebrate communities was tested. The method of Residual
Maximum Likelihood (REML), using GENSTAT 14 (Payne, Murray &
Harding 2011), was used to ﬁt a linear mixed model to three response
variables for each data set separately: (i) total invertebrate abundance,
(ii) abundance of phytophagous invertebrates (excluding predators and
detritivores) and (iii) abundance of invertebrates weighted by impor-
tance in the diets of a selection of farmland bird chicks. In each case,
region and year were considered as random effects and the ﬁrst and
second CCA axes scores as ﬁxed terms. A natural logarithm transfor-
mation was applied to the response variables to ensure a normal distri-
bution. To calculate the third response variable, the numbers of
individuals in different orders of invertebrates were multiplied by a
conversion factor generated from a review of invertebrates as food for
farmland birds in Europe (Holland et al. 2006). The review paper cal-
culated a mean percentage of the invertebrate chick food diet from a
range of sampling methods and composition measures (i.e. percentage
of items, percentage biomass and percentage occurrence) for each of
14 farmland bird species; the conversion factor used in this study was
calculated as the mean of this variable for all bird species, in which it
was present in the diet. It has been established previously that the
abundance of consumers is related to plant biomass in arable ﬁelds
(Haughton et al. 2003). Because the aim of this analysis was to quan-
tify qualitative differences in the value of plant resources, all response
variables were divided by plant biomass (FSE) or percentage cover
(Farm4Bio) before being used in models.
Results
The PCA of variance in trait values between species within
the arable ﬂora sampled across both data sets (Fig. 1)
conﬁrmed a trade-off between ruderal traits, which increase
ﬁtness in disturbed environments (high SLA, frequent and
early ﬂowering, and low seed mass) and competitive traits
(including tall stature and perennial life-form). There were
clear functional trends between the plant communities sam-
pled from different habitats (Table 1). Weed communities
sampled from the annual crops in the FSE experiment were
characterized by high proportions of annuals with high
community-weighted
means
for
ruderal
traits
(including
high SLA and low LDMC). Plant communities sampled
from
the
regularly
disturbed
habitats
in
the
Farm4Bio
experiment had similar trait values to the annual crops. In
contrast, the two perennial habitats, ﬂoristically enhanced
margins and grass margins, had lower SLA, higher LDMC
and later ﬂowering.
For both the data sets derived from in-ﬁeld habitats (FSE)
and uncropped land (Farm4Bio), the community-weighted
mean values for the eight traits signiﬁcantly explained a pro-
portion of the variance between plant communities in the
CCAs (3.7%, P = 0.001 and 8.4%, P = 0.001 respectively,
Fig. 2). In the case of the Farm4Bio data, where there was a
clear distinction between disturbed and undisturbed habitats,
the ﬁrst axis differentiated between samples along the ruderal
vs. competitive functional gradient with NR, IRC and WBC
(the three annually disturbed habitats) samples associated with
high SLA, low LDMC and early and precocious ﬂowering. In
contrast, the eight traits explained less of the variance
between samples in the FSE data set. The ﬁrst axis was lar-
gely determined by life-form (identiﬁed as the most important
variable by forward selection), with maize having a higher
proportion of perennials (Table 1). However, the second CCA
axis reﬂected the trade-off between communities characterized
by more ruderal vs. more competitive traits as was observed
in the Farm4Bio data, although this trend does not appear to
have been driven by crop types, which were mostly associ-
ated with the ﬁrst axis.
In the Farm4Bio data set, variance in invertebrate abun-
dance per unit cover between samples was correlated with
the ﬁrst CCA axis, with high loadings for SLA, LDMC and
ﬂowering time (Table 2, Fig. 3). Although a similar positive
relationship between invertebrate abundance per unit weed
biomass and these traits was observed in the FSE data set
(represented by the second CCA axis), particularly for total
invertebrates,
a
greater
proportion
of
the
variance
was
explained by the ﬁrst axis, with a high loading for life-form
(Table 2). In the Farm4Bio data set, variance in phytopha-
gous invertebrates and invertebrate samples weighted by
importance in the diets of farmland bird chicks were similar
to those for total invertebrates. However, because of the
high proportion of Collembola in the FSE samples, Table 3,
variance in total invertebrates was less well correlated with
phytophagous invertebrates and chickfood items (Fig. 4).

Discussion
The plant response/effect framework has proved to be an
effective tool for modelling the impact of environmental
change
on
ecosystem
services
delivered
by
plant
communities, particularly in grassland systems (Lavorel &
Grigulis 2012). A natural progression of this approach is to
develop quantitative models that incorporate the functional
responses of consumers and the ecosystem services they
deliver based on their functional response to variance in
plant traits. This will be particularly important for extend-
ing the trait-based approach to quantifying ecosystem ser-
vices to arable systems where many services are delivered
by consumers. The consistent trend, in both the ordinations
of the data base of arable plant traits and the plant commu-
nities sampled in the two data sets, between suites of traits
that are indicative of ruderal vs. competitive strategies con-
ﬁrmed that frequency of disturbance is an important driver
of community assembly in the arable systems analysed in
this study. In the Farm4Bio data set, there was a clear
functional distinction between habitats with annual distur-
bance and perennial habitats, reﬂected by the ﬁrst CCA
axis being driven by ruderal traits including SLA, LDMC
and time of ﬂowering. In the FSE data set, where the fre-
quency of disturbance was similar across the crop types,
the traits included in this analysis explained less of the var-
iance between ﬁelds, where weed communities were largely
associated with the speciﬁc management of the different
crops. The primary ordination axis was driven by the
higher proportion of perennial species in the maize plots,
possibly as a result of maize often being incorporated into
Table 1. Average community-weighted mean values for eight functional traits (with standard errors in parentheses) calculated for 336 ﬁeld margin samples in the Farm4Bio data set across ﬁve habitat types
[natural regeneration (NR), wild bird cover (WBC), insect rich cover (IRC), ﬂoristically enhanced grass (FEG) and grass buffer strips (GBS)] and 252 ﬁeld samples in the FSE data set across four crop types

trade-off was still observed on the second ordination axis,
possibly as a result of previous ﬁeld history or the nature of
the margin bordering the crops [the majority of weeds are
found on the edges of ﬁeld and often reﬂect the ﬂora in the
ﬁeld margins (Marshall 1989)].
Leaf traits can account for the variation in palatability
between species (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2003) and were
therefore
expected
to
be
a
useful
common
metric
for
integrating across habitats with contrasting plant communities
in terms of their value to invertebrates. The strong positive
relationship between the functional axis of SLA vs. LDMC
and duration vs. time to ﬁrst ﬂowering and invertebrate
abundance in the Farm4Bio data conﬁrmed that invertebrates
were favouring more ruderal communities, the high R2 for
the model indicating a strong overlap between response and
effect traits in this data set. Although a similar relationship
was observed in the FSE data, invertebrate abundance also
appeared to be responding positively to life-form; this is con-
trary to what would be expected as perennials were generally
characterized by a lower SLA and higher LDMC in the trait
data base. It is probable that weed community assembly
between the different crops is being driven by additional
plant traits that have not been included in this analysis,
including response to herbicides (Fried, Norton & Reboud
2008; Fried, Chauvel & Reboud 2009). The lower explana-
tory power of the models in predicting both the functional
response of the weed communities to management and the
effect on invertebrate abundance suggests that the selection
of traits could be improved to better take account of these
crop management drivers.
It was expected that the response of phytophagous inverte-
brate groups to leaf traits would be stronger than that for total
invertebrate numbers. However, this effect was not observed
and may reﬂect the complex interactions at the trophic levels
above the predators acting as a top down control on herbivore
numbers (Hawes et al. 2009). However, the fact that variation
in the abundance phytophagous invertebrate groups could be
modelled using plant functional traits is an important link in
the pathway being developed in this study as, in the FSE data
set, phytophages were more closely correlated with the dietary
requirements of farmland birds.
Non-crop arable plants have traditionally been viewed neg-
atively as an impediment to crop production, reducing yield

and crop quality. Any methodology for quantifying the posi-
tive contribution of these ﬂoras to maintaining biodiversity
and ecosystem services must therefore be set in the context
of these dis-services associated with weeds. Because of the
negative impact of weeds in crops, the tendency has been to
manage plants for conserving ecosystem services, such as
farmland birds and pollinators, on uncropped land outside the
crop. Within these areas, habitats that require annual estab-
lishment are also less favoured by farmers and instead there
had been a widespread adoption of perennial habitats with
low disturbance such as grass buffer strips (Butler, Vickery
& Norris 2007). Our results have demonstrated that a given
gram of plant biomass in different habitats is not functionally
equivalent and that, in the case of invertebrate food for farm-
land birds, plant communities adapted to regularly disturbed
habitats (ruderals) are preferred over later successional com-
munities. This has implications for the land sparing approach
which assumes that ﬁeld centres will be managed solely for
food production. If the function of the weed communities
adapted to cultivated ﬁelds is to be provided on uncropped
land, areas need to be regularly disturbed to encourage desir-
able ruderal plants (Storkey & Westbury 2007; Westbury

et al. 2008). The analysis of the Farm4Bio data set in this
study highlighted the value of wild bird cover, insect rich
cover and natural regeneration as example habitats. For the
former two, it was the understorey of weeds that provided
much of the beneﬁt for invertebrates as opposed to the sown
species. However, in the design of the spatial arrangement of
these habitats, reference should be made to the ecology of
the farmland birds using them as a resource in terms of their
foraging behaviour (Butler et al. 2009; Henderson et al.
2012).
The quantitative relationships between management, plant
functional traits and invertebrates that provide an ecosystem
service has established a baseline for building a more
complex model incorporating different invertebrate functional
groups and ecosystem services. Examples include pollinators
and biocontrol agents. It is probable that these groups will
respond to different plant traits, as already demonstrated for
granivorous carabids (Brooks et al. 2012). For example, we
would expect pollinator abundance to be related to ﬂowering
time and nectar quality and quantity. The large data sets used
to validate the approach taken in this study have the potential
to populate these models with data from sites with contrasting
management and environmental variables. These data could
be used in the future to build a fully quantiﬁed framework of
the response of ecosystem services to plant traits to allow
multiple services to be mapped at the landscape scale using
common functional metrics.

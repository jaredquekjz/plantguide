ecological measures, including the maintenance of “eco-
logical focus areas”, such as ﬁ eld margins (i.e. “greening 
of direct payment” in Pillar 1, Hodge et al., 2015). Moreo-

adopted by farmers on a voluntary basis, were developed 
to “reduc[e] environmental risks associated with modern 
farming on the one hand, and preserve nature and cultivat-
ed landscapes on the other hand” (European Commission,

Abstract. Among the semi-natural elements in agricultural landscapes, wildﬂ ower strips sown at ﬁ eld margins or within ﬁ elds are 
potential habitats for the natural enemies of insect pests. As insects are sensitive to a variety of ﬂ ower traits, we hypothesized that 
mixtures with high functional diversity attract and support a higher abundance and species richness of aphid ﬂ ower visiting preda-
tors than mixtures with low functional diversity. During a ﬁ eld experiment, repeated over two years (2014 and 2015) in Gembloux 
(Belgium), aphid predators (i.e., lacewings, ladybeetles and hoverﬂ ies) were pan-trapped in ﬁ ve sown ﬂ ower mixtures (including 
a control mixture, with three replicates of each mixture) of low to high functional diversity based on seven traits (i.e., ﬂ ower colour, 
ultra-violet reﬂ ectance and pattern, start and duration of ﬂ owering, height and ﬂ ower class, primarily based on corolla morphol-
ogy). In both years, the species of ﬂ owering plants in the sown mixtures (i.e., sown and spontaneous ﬂ owers) were listed, and the 
realized functional diversity in each plot calculated. Over the two years, a high functional diversity was not associated with high 
abundance and richness of aphid predators. Moreover, ladybeetles, which made up the majority of the predators trapped, were 
more abundant in mixtures with very low or intermediate functional diversity at sowing, especially in 2014. We hypothesize that 
certain ﬂ owers, which were abundant in certain mixtures (and not in those exhibiting the highest functional diversity), attracted 
predators and were sufﬁ ciently abundant to support them. Our results present novel information that could be used for developing 
ﬂ ower mixtures that provide effective ecosystem services, such as pest control.
INTRODUCTION
Wildﬂ ower strips (WFS) are one of several types of habi-
tats used by insects in agricultural landscapes (Holland et 
al., 2016). There is extensive evidence that, when sown at 
ﬁ eld margins, WFS support a higher abundance and diver-
sity of insects compared to adjacent crops (reviewed by 
Haaland et al., 2011). Indeed, WFS provide insects with 
ﬂ oral food (such as nectar and pollen), as well as alternative 
prey and hosts for insect predators and parasitoids, respec-
tively. WFS also provide insects with overwintering sites 
and shelters against adverse conditions, such as pesticide 
spraying (Landis et al., 2000). For these reasons, subsidiz-
ing the sowing of WFS is part of the agri-environmental

vided by ﬂ owers must be available when the insects need it 
(Colley & Luna, 2000).
The extensive literature available on how ﬂ ower traits 
affect natural enemy behaviour highlights that different 
insect species respond differently to the same trait. There-
fore, it is hypothesized that mixing ﬂ ower species with dif-
ferent values for these traits, generating a high functional 
diversity (FD) at the mixture level, will attract and support 
a high diversity and abundance of insects. Previous studies 
showed that plant mixtures with high FD beneﬁ t both natu-
ral enemies and pollinators (Fontaine et al., 2006; Camp-
bell et al., 2012; Balzan et al., 2014). However, the high 
FD in these studies was based on an increased diversity in 
types of corolla, which determines the availability of food 
resources. Because insects are sensitive to several other 
ﬂ ower traits, the present study aimed to explore whether 
a high FD in ﬂ ower mixtures based on a multiplicity of 
traits enhances their use by ﬂ ower visiting aphid predators. 
Our results are expected to provide baseline information 
for developing effective WFS mixtures for use in agricul-
tural landscapes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study design
Field experiments were conducted during the 2014 and 2015 
growing seasons in a 9 ha ﬁ eld of the experimental farm belong-
ing to Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech (University of Liège), Namur 
Province, Belgium (50°34´03 ̋ N; 4°42´27 ̋ E). The ﬁ eld was char-
acterized by a loamy soil that drains naturally (Service Public de 
Wallonie, 2014). Before starting this experiment, the ﬁ eld was 
managed conventionally (i.e. synthesised fertilisers and pesti-
cides were applied), and winter wheat was grown the previous 
year. No particular soil treatments were implemented before the 
experiment. A forest (i.e. l’Escaille natural reserve) is present 
on the north-west side of the ﬁ eld, while a young agroforestry 
system (planted in 2013) is present on the north-east side. Five 
WFS (125 m × 8 m) were sown in 2013. Each strip was divid-
ed into ﬁ ve equally sized plots (25 m × 8 m), i.e., a total of 25 
plots. These plots were sown with ﬁ ve different ﬂ ower mixtures 
in a Latin square design. Three out of the ﬁ ve strips were as-
sessed due to logistic constraints and work force limitation (Fig. 
1). Four of the ﬁ ve mixtures contained seven ﬂ ower species and 
three grass species (Festuca rubra, Agrostis spp. and Poa praten-
sis). The ﬁ fth mixture (control, C) only contained the three grass 
species (Table 1). All ﬂ owering plants are native perennial spe-
cies that are commonly found in Belgian grasslands (beneﬁ ts of 
such species, compared to exotic and/or annual species are re-
viewed by Fiedler & Landis, 2007a), are typically used in agri-
environmental schemes in Wallonia, Belgium, and are available 
commercially (seeds were obtained from ECOSEM, Belgium). 
Flower species (0.5 kg.ha–1 of each, see Table 1) and grass species 
(Festuca rubra: 11.5 kg.ha–1; Agrostis spp.: 5 kg.ha–1; Poa prat-
ensis: 5 kg.ha–1) were sown on 6th June 2013. Equal seed masses 
of the ﬂ ower species were sown so that the species were similarly 
abundant. Species with lower seed mass are expected to suffer a 
greater mortality and, thus, might need more seeds compared to 
species with higher seed mass in order to obtain the same abun-
dance (Turnbull et al., 1999). Each year, WFS were mown at the 
end of June and September. Adjacent to WFS, oilseed rape (Bras-
sica napus L.) was grown from September 2013 to June 2014, 
while winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown from Octo-
ber 2014 to July 2015.
ecosystem services, in addition to approaches that purely 
aim to support biodiversity (McKenzie et al., 2013; Ekroos 
et al., 2014). Among other ecosystem services (Zhang et 
al., 2007), the natural regulation of insect pests is of par-
ticular interest when considering the damaging effects of 
insecticides on human health and the environment (Devine 
& Furlong, 2007; Baldi et al., 2013) and the resistance of 
pests to insecticides (Foster et al., 2007).
Conservation biological control is deﬁ ned as “the use 
of tactics and approaches that involve the manipulation of 
the environment (i.e., the habitat) of natural enemies so as 
to enhance their survival, and/or physiological and behav-
ioural performance, and resulting in enhanced effective-
ness” (Barbosa, 1998). When applied to WFS, such ma-
nipulations consist of sowing mixtures that support natural 
enemies. Yet, enhancing natural enemies through habitat 
management might not necessarily lead to pest control. 
In addition to the ﬁ ve hypotheses proposed by Tscharntke 
et al. (2016), the resources and shelter provided by WFS 
might retain natural enemies, limiting their ability to con-
trol pests in adjacent crops (Rand et al., 2006). Moreover, 
simply sowing ﬂ owers might not generate a higher abun-
dance of key beneﬁ cial species in strips, and reduce the 
abundance of pests in adjacent crops (Uyttenbroeck et al., 
2016). One explanation is that some natural enemies might 
not be attracted to the species of ﬂ owers that are sown, 
or, if they are, might not ﬁ nd the resources that they need 
(Wäckers, 2004). Therefore, several studies have explored 
the effects of speciﬁ c ﬂ ower species on insect behaviour 
in order to select the species that effectively attract and 
support the beneﬁ cial ones (Tooker et al., 2006; Fiedler & 
Landis, 2007a; Van Rijn & Wäckers, 2010; Carrié et al., 
2012). However, the functional traits of ﬂ owers must be 
assessed in order to understand why some ﬂ ower species 
are suitable for insects, and why some are not.
Traits are deﬁ ned as “any morphological, physiological 
or phenological feature measurable at the individual level” 
(Violle et al., 2007). When traits are considered in the envi-
ronment in which a plant grows, they may affect ecological 
processes, and are qualiﬁ ed as functional (Dı́az & Cabido, 
2001). Several studies have explored the effect of ﬂ ower 
traits on the behaviour of natural enemies using labora-
tory experiments, monospeciﬁ c plots in ﬁ elds or plants in 
pots (Mondor & Warren, 2000; Schaller & Nentwig, 2000; 
Fiedler & Landis, 2007b; Miller et al., 2013; Van Rijn & 
Wäckers, 2016). The shape of the corolla is another ﬂ ower 
trait, which determines how insects access the food pro-
vided by ﬂ owers. This trait has been extensively studied 
because many natural enemies need pollen and nectar at 
certain stages in their development (Lu et al., 2014; Van 
Rijn et al., 2016). Other morphological traits, such as col-
our and ultra-violet (UV) reﬂ ectance, are involved in host 
plant recognition and, thus, ﬂ ower attractiveness (Chittka 
et al., 1994; Campbell et al., 2010), while plant height 
might affect their ﬂ ight (Wratten et al., 2003). Finally, phe-
nological traits, such as the month of the onset and duration 
of ﬂ owering, might be important, because the food pro-

Sown functional diversity
The four ﬂ ower mixtures (the ﬁ fth one being the control) were 
chosen based on their FD values using Rao’s quadratic index 
(Botta-Dukát, 2005). To create the mixtures, 20 ﬂ ower species 
were chosen and described based on seven of their functional 
traits that were retrieved from Lambinon et al. (2008) and the 
TRY database (Kattge et al., 2011) (Table S1). The seven traits 
were chosen based on their potential effect on ﬂ ower visitors. 
First, visual cues are known to be decisive for insects when se-
lecting a plant (Campbell et al., 2010). Hence, the following traits 
were considered: (i) ﬂ ower colour, (ii) UV reﬂ ectance of the pe-
ripheral part of the ﬂ ower, and (iii) whether the UV reﬂ ectance of 
the internal ﬂ ower part differed from that of the external part (also 
called “UV pattern”). Second, ﬂ owering phenology determines 
whether ﬂ oral resources are available when target insects need 
them (Colley et al., 2000). Therefore, (iv) the month of the onset 
of ﬂ owering and (v) the duration of ﬂ owering were chosen. Third, 
(vi) vegetation height was included, because it might affect insect 
ﬂ ight (Wratten et al., 2003). Fourth, (vii) ﬂ ower class after Müller 
(1881) was used, because it provides a measure of the the avail-
ability of nectar for insects that visit ﬂ owers, which determines 
whether WFS are able to support natural enemies (Van Rijn et 
al., 2016). All of the possible combinations of mixtures of seven 
species were listed, and their FD value was calculated (R function 
“divc”, package “ade4”; Dray & Dufour, 2007). Combinations 
with the lowest and the highest FD were selected, as well as those 
with a value closest to the 33rd and the 67th percentile of the range. 
As a result, four mixtures were generated with contrasting FD, 
termed very low (VL), low (L), high (H) and very high (VH) 
(Table 1). 
Realized functional diversity
To evaluate the effect of the realized FD of the mixtures on 
ﬂ ower visiting aphid predators, the effective composition of the 
ﬂ ower mixtures was assessed each year. In three 1 m*1 m perma-
nent quadrats in each plot (Fig. 1), ﬂ ower species were recorded 
and their relative cover estimated on 18–19 June 2014 and 19–23 
June 2015 (before mowing). The nomenclature of Lambinon et 
al. (2004) was followed. Based on the species of ﬂ owers listed 
(both sown and spontaneous), their traits and their relative cover 
in the quadrats, the realized FD of the mixture in each plot was 
calculated.
Monitoring of insect species
Flower visiting predators were trapped from 7 May to 25 June 
2014 and from 12 May to 30 June 2015 (i.e. for seven weeks 
in both years). In each plot, a yellow pan trap (Flora®, 27 cm 
diameter and 10 cm depth) was installed on a ﬁ berglass stick and 
positioned at vegetation height. Its position was adjusted during 
the growing season to follow plant growth. Traps were ﬁ lled with 
water containing a few drops of detergent (dish-washing liquid) 
to reduce the surface tension of the water. The traps were emptied 
and reﬁ lled every seven days, and the trapped insects were con-
served in 70% ethanol. Aphidophagous ladybeetles (Coleoptera: 
Coccinellidae), as well as lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) 
and hoverﬂ ies (Diptera: Syrphidae), the larvae of which prey on 
aphids, were identiﬁ ed to species using identiﬁ cation keys in San 
Martin (2004), van Veen (2010) and Roy et al. (2013), respective-
ly. Because the adults of these predatory families are all highly 
mobile and able to traverse agricultural landscapes (Evans, 2003; 
Villenave et al., 2006; Almohamad et al., 2009), their dispersion 
through the different plots was comparable.
Statistical analyses 
First, the linear relation between the sown and realized FD in 
each plot was tested for both years by using Pearson’s correlation 
(P < 0.05).
Second, the effects of the sown mixtures on insect abundance 
(response variables: all predators pooled, and lacewings, lady-
beetles, hoverﬂ ies individually) and total predator species rich-
ness (species of the three predator families pooled) were assessed 
by ﬁ tting generalised linear mixed effect models (R function 
“glmer”, package “lme4”; Bates et al., 2014) with Poisson error 
distribution (log-link function). Mixtures (C, VL, L, H, VH), 
years (2014, 2015) and their interaction were included as ﬁ xed 
factors, and the plots included as random effects, as measures 
were repeated on seven consecutive occasions in the same plots 
each year. For every model, data over-dispersion was tested and 
found to occur for the summed predator, ladybeetle and hoverﬂ y 
abundance. For these variables, generalised linear models with 
negative binomial error distribution were ﬁ tted (R function “glm.
nb”, package “MASS”, Venables & Ripley, 2002), as suggested 
by Ver Hoef & Boveng (2007). The effects of ﬁ xed factors in 
every model were tested using likelihood-ratio tests (P < 0.05). 
When their interaction was signiﬁ cant, analyses were performed 
for each year separately.
Third, the effect of the realized FD on insect abundance (re-
sponse variables: all predators pooled, and lacewings, ladybee-
tles, hoverﬂ ies individually) and total predator species richness 
(numbers of species of the three predator families pooled) were 
assessed for each year separately, as each year each plot poten-
tially had a different value of FD, by ﬁ tting generalised linear 
mixed effect models. FD values were included as ﬁ xed factors 
and plots were included as random factors. Data over-dispersion 
was tested and found to occur for the summed predator, lady-
beetle and hoverﬂ y abundance in 2014. Thus, generalised linear 
models with negative binomial error distribution were ﬁ tted in-
stead. The effects of realized FD in every model were tested using 
likelihood-ratio tests (P < 0.05). All analyses were done using R 
program (R Core Team, 2013).
RESULTS
Flower cover, species and functional diversity 
Twenty-one and 20 ﬂ ower species were recorded in the 
quadrats in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Table 2), out of 
which eight species in both years were not sown. Among 
these spontaneous species, Cirsium arvense and Sinapis 
alba had the highest cover in plots in 2014, whereas in 
2015 it was C. arvense and Rumex obtusifolius (Table 2). 
The cover of all other spontaneous species never on aver-
age exceeded 3% of the quadrat surface in each plot. Con-
versely, three of the sown species, Anthriscus sylvestris, 
Heracleum sphondylium and Lythrum salicaria, were not 
recorded in either year, with Origanum vulgare also not 
recorded in 2015.
The values of the realized FD in 2014 and 2015 are given 
in Table 2. Except for the C plots, the values of the realized 
FD were lower than those of the sown mixtures. No signiﬁ -
cant correlations were found between the sown and real-
ized FD in both 2014 (df = 13; r = 0.48; p-value = 0.071) 
and 2015 (df = 13; r = 0.22; p-value = 0.423). 
Aphid predator abundance and diversity
Predators were signiﬁ cantly more abundant in 2014 than 
2015 (i.e. 161 and 51 individuals trapped respectively, Ta-

70
Hatt et al., Eur. J. Entomol. 114: 66–76, 2017 
doi: 10.14411/eje.2017.010
bles 3–4). Ladybeetles were the most abundant predators 
in both years, especially in 2014, followed by hoverﬂ ies 
and lacewings (total abundance is presented in Table 3). 
Equal species richness was recorded for ladybeetles and 
hoverﬂ ies in 2014 (i.e., four species); however, hoverﬂ y 
species richness was higher in 2015 (i.e. ﬁ ve and three 
species respectively, Table 3). During this two year experi-
ment, only one species of lacewing was recorded.
Effect of sown mixtures and realized functional 
diversity on aphid predators
Only ladybeetle abundance was signiﬁ cantly associated 
with the mixtures sown (Table 4). As the interaction be-
tween mixture and year effects was also signiﬁ cant, annual 
analyses showed that mixtures had a nearly signiﬁ cant ef-
fect in 2014 (df = 4; χ² = 9.4; p-value = 0.052) and a signiﬁ -
cant effect in 2015 (df = 4; χ² = 12.4; p-value = 0.014). The 
mixtures had no signiﬁ cant effect on the sums of predators, 
lacewings and hoverﬂ ies and their species richness (Table 
4). In 2014, ladybeetles were the most numerous in VL, L 
and H mixtures, whereas they were the least abundant in 
L and VH mixtures in 2015 (Fig. 2). Neither insect abun-
dance (i.e., sum of predators, as well as every family sepa-
rately) nor their species richness was signiﬁ cantly affected 
by the realized FD in either 2014 or 2015 (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Our study indicates that a high abundance and richness 
of ﬂ ower visiting aphid predators is not necessarily asso-
ciated with a high FD of ﬂ ower mixtures. Only ladybee-
tles, which made up the majority of the predators trapped 
in both years, were affected by the sown mixtures. Lady-
beetles were mostly trapped in plots where the FD of the 
mixture was very low or intermediate at sowing, especially 
in 2014.
A surprisingly low number of predators was trapped. 
In the case of hoverﬂ ies, we trapped on average 30 times 
more per week per trap in the crops growing adjacent to 
the WFS in 2015 (Hatt et al., 2017) while Tschumi et al. 
(2016) trapped on average 20 times more per week per 
trap in WFS adjacent to potato crops in June and July in 
Switzerland. A reason for this might be that hoverﬂ y abun-
dance often peaks in July in such regions, as was the case 
in 2015 in adjacent crops (Hatt et al., 2017). In the present 
experiment, insects were trapped in the WFS only up to 
the end of June. As for ladybeetles, a slightly higher num-
ber than recorded in these previous studies was trapped in 
2014, but three times less was recorded in 2015. Indeed, 
insect abundance differed in the two years of the study. The 
higher abundance of predators, especially ladybeetles, in 
2014 might be due to the early summer in that year, favour-
ing greater insect occurrence in early spring compared to 
2015. In addition, other studies conducted in the same re-
gion report a very low density of ladybeetles in 2015, indi-
cating that their abundance was low that year in the region 
of Gembloux (Fassotte, 2016; Hatt et al., 2017). Similar 
annual variability in ladybeetle abundance is reported in 
Belgium (Vandereycken et al., 2013).
The results recorded for the effect of FD contradicted 
our hypothesis. We expected the abundance and richness 
of natural enemies to be positively associated with FD,

both years, three repetitions per mixture, one yellow pan-trap per repetition, which was emptied and reﬁ lled every week).

because these predators have different nutritional require-
ments and might react differently to different ﬂ ower traits 
at different times. However, our ﬁ ndings are consistent 
with Balzan et al. (2014, 2016), who report that FD had 
no effect on the abundance of ﬂ ower visiting natural en-
emies. Furthermore, these authors report that mixtures 
with intermediary FD support a higher natural enemy rich-
ness. Balzan et al. (2014, 2016) increased FD by increas-
ing the diversity of ﬂ ower corolla types, which determines 
the ability of natural enemies to beneﬁ t from ﬂ ower nectar 
(Vattala et al., 2006; Van Rijn & Wäckers, 2016). Insect 
abundance and diversity recorded in this study, however is 
not associated with FD based on seven traits. Balzan et al. 
(2014, 2016) suggest that the presence of certain species of 
plants, particularly those attractive to natural enemies (i.e., 
Apiaceae spp. in their case), might mask the effect of FD 
on ﬂ ower visitors. This might also have affected our re-
sults, especially as some ﬂ owering species covered a large 
surface area in some plots, whereas others that were sown 
were not even recorded (Table 2).
There are several explanations for the unequal establish-
ment of different species of plants, despite similar seed 
weights being sown. For instance, competition for space 
and resources might result in the establishment of the most 
competitive species. Alternatively, the conventional farm-
ing practices used in the ﬁ eld before the experiment (es-
pecially the application of nitrogen fertilisers) might have 
favoured the most productive species, which limited the 
establishment of diversiﬁ ed mixtures (Pywell et al., 2002). 
In our experiment, the Asteraceae Leucanthemum vulgare 
was the most abundant species in VL and H mixtures (Table 
2). The high abundance of this species, compared to others, 
may account for the lower than expected values of realized 
FD in H and the low values in VL plots. However, most of 
the predators trapped, especially ladybeetles, were trapped 
in the H and VL plots. Leucanthemum vulgare is typically 
visited by hoverﬂ ies, ladybeetles and lacewings (Ricci et 
al., 2005; Carrié et al., 2012; Wäckers & Van Rijn, 2012), 
because it is a rich source of nectar and pollen (Brodie et 
al., 2015). This resource might be of particular beneﬁ t to 
ladybeetles, for which pollen is one its most nutritious non-
prey food sources, enabling them to complete their devel-
opment and survive when prey are scarce (Berkvens et al., 
2008; Lundgren, 2009).
Adult hoverﬂ ies exclusively feed on ﬂ owers, with pol-
len providing a source of proteins that directly inﬂ uence 
their fecundity, while nectar is a source of sugars, provid-
ing energy and increasing their longevity and foraging 
capacity (Laubertie et al., 2012; Van Rijn et al., 2013). 
Thus, any ﬂ ower that was abundant in the mixtures and 
produced nectar (i.e. ﬂ owers with shallow ﬂ orets, because 
hoverﬂ ies have a short proboscis; Van Rijn & Wäckers, 
2016) and pollen are likely to be attractive. For instance, 
the Asteraceae, Achillea millefolium, is typically visited 
by hoverﬂ ies (Salveter, 1998; Tooker et al., 2006; Car-
rié et al., 2012) and enhances their longevity (Van Rijn & 
Wäckers, 2016). In our study, A. millefolium was present 
in every ﬂ ower mixture, and was quite abundant in most 
plots (Table 2). The presence of this species might have 
resulted in hoverﬂ ies being equally distributed across the 
different treatments. Moreover, ladybeetles and hoverﬂ ies 
are sensitive to colour, especially yellow (Sutherland et al., 
1999; Mondor et al., 2000). Hoverﬂ ies are also sensitive to 
ﬂ owers with a contrasting UV-pattern (Koski & Ashman, 
2014). Some species with these traits might have been at-
tractive. For instance, Hypochaeris radicata was quite 
abundant in L mixtures, especially in 2014, and might have 
attracted hoverﬂ ies, resulting in their being slightly (but 
not signiﬁ cantly) more numerous in plots with these than 
other mixtures.
Lacewings were less abundant than other predators in 
both years. They might also have beneﬁ ted from a large 
variety of ﬂ owers in the strips, as they are considered to 
be opportunistic (Villenave et al., 2006). In addition, some 
spontaneous weeds, such as C. arvense and R. obtusifolius 
(the most abundant spontaneous plants listed in several 
plots), might have attracted predators, as they often host 
aphids that are prey for ladybeetle adults and the larvae 
of all three predators studied (Salveter, 1998). This phe-
nomenon might also explain why some individuals were 
trapped in the control plots, even when few ﬂ oral resources 
were available but with the values of the functional traits 
differed enough to result in higher than expected values of 
realized FD. 
The presence of prey in adjacent crops might also have 
attracted natural enemies out of the ﬂ ower strips, poten-
tially explaining their generally low abundance in the mix-
tures. Indeed, hoverﬂ y adults for instance search for aphid 
colonies in which to lay their eggs after having fed on 
ﬂ owers (Almohamad et al., 2009). While further analyses 
are needed to conﬁ rm such a hypothesis, a higher abun-
dance of natural enemies in adjacent crops than in WFS, 
would enhance biological pest control. Despite the high-
er FD of VH mixtures at sowing, and to some extent in 
2014 and 2015 (Table 2), the low attraction of the WFS 
to natural enemies might also be explained by the limited 
establishment of some of the species sown. The cover of 
Fig. 2. Mean (summed abundance recorded during seven weeks 
of trapping each year divided by the three repetitions ± SEM) lady-
beetle abundance in each mixture sown, based on their functional 
diversity at sowing: C – control, VL – very low, L – low, H – high, 
VH – very high.

doi: 10.14411/eje.2017.010
sown ﬂ ower species in the quadrats was low (except for A. 
millefolium, which was also abundant in other mixtures) 
and, some sown species, like Lythrum salicaria, were not 
even recorded in the quadrats (Table 2). Moreover, some 
of the plant species that established successfully could a 
priori not provide food for hoverﬂ ies, ladybeetles or lace-
wings, because of their ﬂ ower morphology. This is the case 
for plants of both Fabaceae and Malvaceae, which have a 
corolla that is too deep for e.g. hoverﬂ ies to access their 
nectar (Wäckers & Van Rijn, 2012).
The non-signiﬁ cant correlations between the sown and 
realized FD indicate that it is difﬁ cult to obtain a certain 
realized FD by sowing ﬂ ower mixtures. This may be due 
to various factors such as the presence of spontaneous spe-
cies, the better development of the most productive and 
competitive, and the non-development of some sown spe-
cies. Considering the optimal growing conditions (e.g. ex-
posure to sun, humidity, soil disturbance) for the different 
species on the one hand, and better balancing of the num-
ber of seeds between the different species by also consider-
ing their productivity and competitiveness (and not only 
considering their weight as in this study) on the other hand, 
may result in more diversiﬁ ed mixtures. Moreover, rather 
than relying on mixture FD, sowing ﬂ ower species that 
are known to support natural enemies might enhance their 
presence in WFS, and even favour pest control in adjacent 
crops. This is the “pick and mix” approach developed by 
Wäckers & Van Rijn (2012) and successfully tested in 
the ﬁ eld by Tschumi et al. (2014, 2015, 2016). Neverthe-
less, WFS have to provide multiple ecosystem services, 
including pollination, and participate in the conservation 
of insect species that are endangered in agricultural land-
scapes (Ekroos et al., 2014; Batáry et al., 2015). Within this 
context, a higher diversity of arthropods could potentially 
occur in ﬂ ower mixtures with a high FD. Indeed, Balzan et 
al. (2014) report that the abundance of wild bees (Hyme-
noptera) increases with FD. Depending on the objectives 
assigned to WFS (i.e. enhancing pest control, pollination, 
conservation, or all of these combined), different strategies 
could be used when formulating ﬂ ower mixtures. 
Within an agricultural context, sowing WFS is proposed 
to enhance biodiversity conservation and ecosystem ser-
vices, with doubts being raised about whether they will be a 
source of pests infesting adjacent crops (Frank, 1998; Hatt 
et al., 2015; Tscharntke et al., 2016). Moreover, it is worth 
establishing the threshold at which increasing the mixture 
of FD also improves its attraction for predators and shelters 
pests. For instance, aphids use visual and olfactory cues to 
locate host plants (Döring, 2014). Thus, increasing plant 
functional diversity might increase the chance of including 
more colours, UV patterns and odours that are attractive to 
aphids. It is also possible, a higher diversity of trait values 
might confuse aphids. For instance, when a high diversity 
of colours is present, the attractive ones might be masked. 
In parallel, if a large variety of odours is present, it might 
not be possible to distinguish attractive cues. This effect of 
diversiﬁ ed plant systems was ﬁ rst theorised by Root (1973) 
in the Resource concentration hypothesis. This suggests 
that diversiﬁ ed cropping systems (e.g. intercropping), or, 
in the present case, diversiﬁ ed ﬂ ower strips, might be less 
attractive to pests than monospeciﬁ c systems (Letourneau 
et al., 2011; Lopes et al., 2016).
The present study investigated an array of traits; howev-
er, the selection was not exhaustive. Other traits could have 
been chosen; for instance, traits related to the abundance 
and quality of nectar and pollen (rather than just availabili-
ty, as used here in the context of “ﬂ ower type” based on the 
classiﬁ cation of Müller, 1881) or the proﬁ le of semiochem-
ical volatiles emitted by ﬂ owers. Indeed, ﬂ ower visiting in-
sects, particularly aphid predators, respond to nectar and 
pollen abundance and quality, as well as odour (Laubertie 
et al., 2006; Adedipe & Park, 2010; Laubertie et al., 2012). 
Thus, it is necessary to screen a variety of ﬂ ower species 
for these traits and establish their ability to attract and sup-
port aphid predators, in order to advance our knowledge in 
this ﬁ eld of research. As the value of the FD being tested 
depends on the chosen traits, further ﬁ eld-based research 
assessing different mixtures based on several other traits 
should be implemented, with the objective of enhancing 
the ability of WFS to deliver multiple ecosystem services 
in agriculture.

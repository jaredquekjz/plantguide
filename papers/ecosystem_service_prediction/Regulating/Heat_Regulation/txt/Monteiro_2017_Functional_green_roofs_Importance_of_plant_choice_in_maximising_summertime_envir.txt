Abstract 
19 
Green roof plants can reduce local air temperatures and heat load to a building in the summer, 
20 
improving thermal comfort of residents. Little is known, however, about how different plants compare 
21 
in their potential to provide these two ecosystem services. Consequently, this study investigated 
22 
whether some plants can offer more potential summertime environmental cooling and substrate 
23 
insulation than others. Over two summers (2012/2013), canopies of two succulent and four broad-
24 
leaved plant genotypes, with contrasting plant traits, were monitored alongside bare substrate in 
25 
Reading, UK. Plants were studied outdoors within small plots (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.1 m). Continuous 
26 
monitoring took place during warm days and nights and included variables (leaf surface temperatures) 
27 
and fluxes (long-wave radiation, sensible heat flux and transpiration) that are indicative of cooling 
28 
potential. The strength of substrate insulation was estimated by comparing the ground heat flux below 
29 
the canopies to that of the bare substrate. Plant traits (leaf colour or thickness), structural parameters 
30 
(height and leaf area index, LAI), radiative properties (albedo and emissivity), and stomatal 
31 
conductance were also measured to help explain the differences in cooling potential among the 
32 
species. Non-succulent canopies, in particular light-coloured ones, with high leaf stomatal 
33 
conductance and high LAI provided maximum potential for substrate insulation and environmental 
34 
cooling in hot periods, particularly compared to bare substrate and thick-leaved succulents. These 
35 
results suggest that succulent plants are not best suited to provide significant summertime 
36 
environmental cooling and substrate insulation and that others (e.g. Salvia and Stachys) might be 
37 
preferable where the delivery of these benefits is a priority. Our findings highlight that, in addition to 
38 
survival, aesthetics and cost, the plants’ ability to deliver a range of ecosystem services should be 
39 
considered in the plant selection/green roof planning process.

1. Introduction 
49 
Urban landscapes are typically warmer than adjacent rural areas [1]. This phenomenon, (the urban 
50 
heat island, UHI), is partly due to anthropogenic activities which generate heat that becomes trapped 
51 
within the urban fabric. It is also due to a widespread use of impervious materials, which alter the 
52 
thermal and radiative properties of the land surface, significantly influencing the surface energy 
53 
balance [2,3]. In urbanised areas, latent heat flux (i.e. evapotranspiration) is thus reduced compared to 
54 
more rural, vegetated areas, while heat storage and the resulting re-emission of heat as long-wave 
55 
radiation or sensible heat are increased. The heat absorbed, stored and re-released as long-wave 
56 
radiation by the urban fabric to the atmosphere can also be intercepted by air pollutants and redirected 
57 
back to the urban environment, contributing to further warming [3].  
58 
The UHI generally has a negative impact on human thermal comfort and health, and this impact is 
59 
predicted to increase due to a warming climate. For example, by the 2080s, mean summertime 
60 
maximum air temperatures in southern England are estimated to rise by an average of 5.4oC, 
61 
compared to 1961-1990 [4]. Heat wave events, which amplify human mortality rates, are also 
62 
expected to increase in intensity, duration and frequency [5]. Residents in urban areas will be 
63 
particularly susceptible to such events, owing to the already enhanced temperatures associated with 
64 
the UHI effect.  
65 
Plants in cities have an important role in reducing local summertime air temperatures and can mitigate 
66 
local UHI [6–9]. However, the area available in highly urbanised cities for green infrastructure 
67 
expansion is scarce. Roofs can occupy around 30% of the horizontal surface within a city [10], 
68 
making them prime spaces to be vegetated. In addition to being able to reduce local air temperatures 
69 
[11], plants on roofs (i.e. green roofs) can further reduce the energy load to the buildings during the 
70 
day in summer, thereby leading to a reduced reliance on artificial air conditioning, thus saving energy 
71 
[12,13].  
72 
Such ecosystem services (i.e. both in terms of summertime air temperature regulation and the plants’ 
73 
ability to reduce the summertime conductive heat load, thus increasing the insulation of the rooftop) 
74 
can be provided by a variety of mechanisms. Plants hold, and can subsequently release, relatively 
75 

 
 
 
5 
 
 
 
large volumes of water. The vapourisation of liquid water consumes about 2450 J per g of water [14]. 
76 
This latent energy is retained in the water molecules that exit through the leaf stomata [15], allowing 
77 
radiation absorbed by well-watered plants to dissipate without an increase in air temperature within 
78 
the immediate environment. Plants on roofs may also absorb less heat than bare roof surfaces [12], 
79 
due to higher reflectance, at least compared to dark surface materials such as bitumen or slate. 
80 
Additionally, plants in urban areas partially absorb the long-wave energy re-emitted by the adjacent 
81 
built surfaces [16] as well as shade a built surface [17]. Thus, when placed on roofs they can reduce 
82 
the radiation received by the roof surface. A model simulating the thermal behaviour of green roofs 
83 
when several parameters, including LAI, were manipulated, found that an increase in LAI from 2 to 5 
84 
led to a decrease of almost 250 W m-2 in solar radiation transmitted to the roof surface [18]. When 
85 
combined, these features lead to green roofs (consisting of the canopy and the below-canopy rooftop) 
86 
being considerably cooler in the summer than their non-green counterparts. This will result in a 
87 
decrease in the heat conducted to the inner parts of the building, but also reduces the release of 
88 
sensible heat and long-wave radiation by the roof, thereby decreasing the extent of warming to the 
89 
wider urban environment.  
90 
While plants differ in their surface temperature when compared to inert roof materials, variations in 
91 
leaf characteristics and canopy structure, substrate factors and physiological traits can vary the 
92 
thermal properties of canopies associated with different species. Leaf temperature is strongly 
93 
influenced by substrate moisture content and leaf stomatal conductance [19,20]. Morphological traits 
94 
such as leaf colour, thickness and pubescence also influence leaf temperature [20,21]. 
95 
Many green roofs are planted with succulents such as Sedum, as they tolerate the dry conditions 
96 
common on extensive green roofs [22,23]. However if sustainable irrigation was possible, other low-
97 
growing plants with higher water requirements could survive too [24]. More water-demanding plants, 
98 
if possessing the ‘right’ traits, could potentially generate greater environmental cooling and substrate 
99 
insulation in the summer than succulents. A previous study within a Mediterranean climate, however, 
100 
could not justify the use of green roofs (with succulent, grass, perennial or small shrub covering) 
101 
solely on the basis of beneficial cooling effects, particularly taking into account the water use and 
102 

 
 
 
6 
 
 
 
associated costs [25]. In contrast though, in climates where natural precipitation is higher and evenly 
103 
distributed over the seasons, the economic benefits of using more water-demanding plants (in terms of 
104 
reduced air conditioning, for example) may outweigh costs linked to supplementary irrigation. 
105 
Despite preliminary evaluations on how different roof plant communities affect the surrounding 
106 
environment and the thermal performance of a roof [26–29], there is still a lack of knowledge on how 
107 
key plant traits influence the energy balance of the combined substrate/vegetation layer and the 
108 
implications for using different plants to provide direct cooling or insulation services.  
109 
The main aim of this research was to determine the extent to which plant genotype affects the 
110 
thermodynamic properties of the substrate-vegetation system during summer. A range of plants 
111 
potential useful for green roof situations, were evaluated within the context of the UK’s temperate 
112 
maritime climate. This study deliberately does not account for any factors (e.g. roof/building material, 
113 
roof orientation, building energy efficiency etc.) that may influence the cooling attributes of green 
114 
roofs per se. Such an experimental set-up would struggle to be comprehensive and would be too 
115 
complicated from an in-depth monitoring point of view, thereby limiting the amount, and potentially 
116 
compromising the quality, of the micrometeorological and plant physiological data. To achieve our 
117 
aim, six genotypes (two succulent and four broad-leaved) with contrasting leaf stomatal conductance 
118 
rates and variations in leaf colour, pubescence or thickness were selected. Canopies were compared 
119 
over two summers with regards to their surface temperatures, outgoing long-wave radiation, and their 
120 
surface energy balance (net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes, as well as substrate heat flux). 
121 
Additional comparisons were made with bare substrate (i.e. non-vegetated plots), which acted as an 
122 
experimental control.  
123 
Improved understanding of the combined effect of these traits will allow urban planners, architects 
124 
and green roof professionals to base their future choice of plants not only on genotypes’ survival and 
125 
aesthetical value, but also on their ability to maximise important ecosystem services.

2. Materials and Methods 
128 
2.1. Plant material 
129 
All plants in the experiment were herbaceous/sub-shrub forms (Figure 1) with potential to be 
130 
integrated in green roofs, particularly if additional irrigation is provided during times of prolonged 
131 
water deficit. These were (with key leaf characteristics in parenthesis): 
132 
 
Heuchera ‘Obsidian’ (non-pubescent, purple)  
133 
 
Heuchera ‘Electra’ (non-pubescent, yellow) 
134 
 
Salvia officinalis ‘Berggarten’ (pubescent with grey-green hue) 
135 
 
Stachys byzantina (pubescent with pale grey hue) 
136 
 
Sempervivum ‘Reinhard’ (non-pubescent, succulent, light to dark green hue) 
137 
 
Sedum mix (a mat of Sedum species used as an industry standard; non-pubescent, succulent 
138 
leaves, light-green hue).  
139 
Individual plants were either propagated in-house or acquired from UK nurseries, as plugs or 9 cm 
140 
potted plants. Sedum mix was acquired as a green roof mat from a commercial supplier (Q lawns, 
141 
Hockwold-cum-Wilton, UK). Non-succulent plants were replanted into 2 L containers to aid further 
142 
establishment, at least one month before being planted into the experimental plots.  
143 
[Insert Figure 1] 
144 
2.2. Experimental setup 
145 
Experiments were carried out in the summers of 2012 (24 July to 21 September) and 2013 (15 July to 
146 
31 August), on the outdoor experimental grounds at the University of Reading (UK). In 2012, 
147 
fourteen timber frames were constructed (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.1 m) and positioned 1.1 m apart. These were 
148 
placed in an open space at ground level rather than on top of building roofs to minimise any ancillary 
149 
thermal effects due to building function and infrastructure (parapets, air cooling vents, chimney flues, 
150 
etc.) and for ease of access. All frames were lined with polyethylene pond liner and filled with a 0.1 m 
151 
layer of John Innes compost No. 2. Field capacity and permanent wilting point of a similar substrate 
152 
were respectively measured at 0.32 and 0.07 g g-1  [30]; equivalent to 0.42 and 0.09 m3 m-3 when 
153 

 
 
 
8 
 
 
 
assuming a substrate bulk density of 1.3 g cm-3, an average of values presented for soils and composts 
154 
with comparable compositions [31,32]. Each treatment was replicated twice, i.e. two ‘mono-culture’ 
155 
plots of each genotype. Plant genotypes were randomly allocated to the plots and planted at least 10 
156 
days before measurements started, to achieve 100% of coverage (or in the case of Sempervivum 80%, 
157 
due to the small size of the plants). The Sedum mix mat was cut to fit the plot with the underneath 
158 
membrane removed, to ensure direct contact with the substrate. 
159 
Two of the frames were left with just bare substrate so that plant canopies could be compared to an 
160 
unplanted ‘control’ surface. A layer of bare substrate was used instead of a rigid inert surface, as it has 
161 
similar hydraulic (i.e. in relation to water retention and transfer) and thermal properties to the 
162 
substrate layers located below the plant canopies.  
163 
In 2013, two additional timber frames were constructed and a new treatment was added. These vacant 
164 
plots were planted with shorter specimens of Salvia, where shoot tips were pinched out to promote a 
165 
bushier, lower habit. Consequently, in 2013, Salvias planted in that year were approximately half the 
166 
height of Salvias planted in 2012; these treatments were used to assess the effect of canopy height on 
167 
the variables studied. 
168 
Plots and surrounding areas were kept weed free, and any emerging flower heads removed from the 
169 
plants to ensure that only the leaf canopy effect was accounted for (flower heads only accounted for a 
170 
very small area).   
171 
Environmental and temperature measurements, described in Table 1, represent mean values over a 10 
172 
minute period (averaged from measurements made every 10 seconds). Sensors (full list in Table 1) 
173 
were attached to DL2e loggers (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and a DataHog2 logger (Skye 
174 
Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK), which were covered by well-ventilated white plastic boxes 
175 
to protect from intense radiation. In addition, incoming long-wave radiation (Li) and wind speed (Uz,) 
176 
at 2 m from the ground were monitored at the University’s meteorological station, located 600 m from 
177 
the experimental plots. 
178 
Leaf temperature, Ts, was measured using thermocouples (Table 1, Figure 2) attached to the underside 
179 
of individual leaves mostly with a plastic paper clip [33] thus ensuring the thermocouple was located 
180 

 
 
 
9 
 
 
 
within the leaf boundary layer (i.e. the air layer in contact with the leaf surface). For succulent and 
181 
Stachys leaves, which are small or easily broken, thermocouples were attached by threading [34]. In 
182 
all cases, selected leaves were young, exposed and fully expanded, and located in the upper layer of 
183 
the canopy. In 2013, plant coverage of yellow Heuchera was reduced to < 50% due to winter losses, 
184 
thus one of the thermocouples within each plot with yellow Heuchera was used to measure leaf 
185 
temperature whilst the other was used to measure substrate temperature.  
186 
Thermocouples and thermistors were calibrated at the start of each experimental season in a hot water 
187 
bath and were measuring within 0.30oC of each other.  
188 
The instantaneous measurements of plant and substrate parameters/variables carried out over the 
189 
course of the experiment (i.e. substrate moisture, SMC; leaf stomatal conductance, gs; albedo, Į; 
190 
spectral reflectance; leaf area index, LAI and canopy height, h) are described in Table 2 (also see 
191 
Figure 2). In addition to the discrete measurements (Table 2), SMC was also continuously recorded 
192 
hourly on four randomly selected plots, with SM200 sensors (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK). 
193 
Both the discrete and continuous SMC measurements were used to estimate continuous SMC 
194 
variations in each treatment, information needed to estimate substrate heat flux and to guide irrigation 
195 
requirements. 
196 
Leaf emissivity, İ, which plays an important role in net radiation calculation via the outgoing long-
197 
wave radiation term, was determined in a laboratory test in 2012. Four leaves from each genotype 
198 
were evaluated, except for Sempervivum where the shape of its leaves prohibited the measurement. 
199 
For each leaf, İ was calculated based on the temperatures extracted from a thermal image, recorded 
200 
with an infrared imaging camera FLIR i5 (FLIR Systems UK, West Malling, UK) whilst the leaf was 
201 
floating in a well-stirred water bath [35]. In all cases, İ was around 0.97. The fact that all leaf 
202 
emissivities were similar suggests that any differences in Ts between genotypes which we 
203 
subsequently determined were caused by differences in Į, gs and/or leaf traits that affect aerodynamic 
204 
transfer.

2.3. Watering requirements 
207 
In both summers, all plots, including the bare ones, were manually irrigated whenever a plot’s mean 
208 
SMC fell below 0.15 m3 m-3. Water applied was adjusted so that mean SMC after irrigation was 
209 
around 0.32 m3 m-3. Salvia received the highest irrigation water quantity in both years and 
210 
Sempervivum the lowest. The total water received by the canopies in 2013 (quantities given are a 
211 
combination of both precipitation and supplementary watering) was approximately: 134 L/m2 for 
212 
Salvia planted in 2012, 127 L/m2 for Salvia planted in 2013, 126 L/m2 for purple Heuchera, 105 L/m2 
213 
for Stachys, 99 L/m2 for Sedum, 93 L/m2 for yellow Heuchera (in plots partially covered) and 77 L/m2 
214 
for Sempervivum. 
215 
When plots were irrigated, the soil around their frame was also irrigated to reduce micro-scale 
216 
advection typical of small-sized plot design experiments surrounded by soil with different moisture 
217 
concentrations [36].  
218 
2.4. Calculation of the outgoing long-wave radiation and surface energy balance 
219 
Net radiation, outgoing long-wave radiation and heat fluxes were calculated for every 10 minutes and 
220 
averaged hourly. Net radiation, Rn, was calculated as: 
221 
Rn = Si + Li - So - Lo,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (1)  
222 
where Si and Li are the short-wave and long-wave radiation received by the surface, and So and Lo are 
223 
the short-wave and long-wave radiation reflected and emitted by the surface.  
224 
At night, So was assumed to be 0 W m-2.  
225 
Continuous daytime So values were not available, but representative estimates of albedo, Į, were 
226 
obtained (see Table 2) to derive So. Using these data, between 10:00-16:00 h, So was calculated as: 
227 
So  = Į Si  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) 
228 
Between 06:00-10:00 h and 16:00-20:00 h, Į was either assumed to be equal to the mean Į values 
229 
between 10:00-16:00 h (when mean Si < 200 W m2), or assumed to increase linearly with a decreasing 
230 
sun angle (when mean Si > 200 W m2 ) [37]. Based on values presented by Monteith and Szeicz [37], 
231 
during sunny periods, maximum Į (at 06:00 or 20:00 h) was set to a value that was 0.05 higher than 
232 
the mean Į for the period between 10:00-16:00 h for canopies, or to 0.03 for bare substrate. 
233 

 
 
 
11 
 
 
 
Lo was calculated according to Stefan-Boltzmann’s law: 
234 
Lo =  İ ı (Ts)4 + (1 – İ) Li , 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  (3)                                          
235 
where ı is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Ts, the mean leaf/surface temperature of each plot, was 
236 
calculated as the mean of temperatures measured by the thermocouples and İ was assumed to be on 
237 
average 0.95 for the bare substrate (based on the ranges presented for bare soils by Rubio et al. [38]), 
238 
0.97 for canopies with LAI > 1, as measured, and 0.96 for canopies with LAI < 1. 
239 
Sensible heat flux, H, was calculated as:  
240 
,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
               (4)  
241 
where Ta is the air temperature recorded at 2 m from the ground, ȡa is the air density, Cp is the air 
242 
specific heat and ra is the aerodynamic resistance, calculated as: 
243 
,          
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  (5)                           
244 
where z is the height of wind and temperature measurements, d is the zero plane displacement height, 
245 
zom is the surface roughness length for momentum transfer, zoh is the surface roughness length for heat 
246 
and vapour transfer, k is the von Karman’s constant (0.41) and Uz is the wind speed. In this equation 
247 
the effect of atmospheric stability has been neglected as this effect is relatively small.  
248 
Roughness parameters d, zom and zoh were calculated as a function of surface cover height:  
249 
d = 2/3 h 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (6) 
250 
zom = 0.123 h 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (7)  
251 
zoh = 0.1 zom         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (8)   
252 
The height of bare substrate was set to 0.01 m, leading to a zom for bare substrate of 0.001 m [39]. 
253 
Substrate heat flux, G, was estimated by Fourier’s law:  
254 
,   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
               (9) 
255 
here ∆T is the substrate temperature difference between two depths (at 0.01 m and 0.06 m) and ∆z is 
256 
the distance between those two depths. The substrate thermal conductivity, , was calculated based on 
257 
the assumed value of substrate bulk density, the quartz content and the estimated continuous SMC, as 
258 

 
 
 
12 
 
 
 
per Lu et al. [32]. Using Eq. 9 with substrate temperatures measured at 0.01 m and 0.06 m means that 
259 
the heat stored in the first 0.01 m of substrate was not accounted for. Calculating this storage would 
260 
require an estimate of heat capacity, Ch, but SMC (required to calculate Ch) in such a thin layer cannot 
261 
be easily determined. Alternatively one could use substrate temperature at 0 m (i.e. the substrate 
262 
surface temperature) to calculate the temperature difference in Eq. 9, but this variable was only 
263 
measured in uncovered (bare) plots. However, this storage term was assumed to be relatively small, in 
264 
particular below vegetation. Furthermore, the plots, albeit lined with polyethylene membranes, were 
265 
not thermally insulated from the ground below them. Thermistors were placed at 0.06 m from the 
266 
substrate surface (and 0.04 m from the membranes) to reduce the influence that the heat flux from the 
267 
ground below may have had on the calculated G. We use G to assess substrate insulation potential of 
268 
the green roof plant species. We define substrate insulation potential as the reduction in (surface) 
269 
ground heat flux by vegetation cover compared to bare substrate. 
270 
Latent heat flux, LE, was calculated as the residual of the energy balance: 
271 
 LE = Rn - H - G  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                   (10) 
272 
With these calculations, any advection and storage of heat in the canopy biomass and within the 
273 
canopy air that might have occurred were embedded in the LE and H heat fluxes terms. 
274 
2.5. Statistical analysis  
275 
Statistical analysis was performed with GenStat 16th Edition (VSN International Ltd., Hemel 
276 
Hempstead, UK). Differences in gs within a season were assessed with analysis of variance 
277 
(ANOVA), on the basis of the least significant difference (LSD; 5% level). Two contrasting groups of 
278 
data (i.e. day and night) were selected for the analysis of differences in calculated Ts, Lo, Rn and heat 
279 
fluxes: i). ten (2012)/nine (2013) rain-free days with Tmax > 24oC and ii). ten rain-free nights with Tmin 
280 
> 12oC. For daytime data, the statistical analysis was only performed over intervals of four hours, 
281 
when differences between treatments reached their maximum: i.e. between 12:00-16:00 h for Ts and Lo 
282 
or 11:00-15:00 h for Rn and heat fluxes. For the night periods, differences were statistically analysed 
283 
between 20:00-24:00 h, when the effect of the UHI is highest [1].  
284 

 
 
 
13 
 
 
 
Data from each selected group/period were analysed using residual maximum likelihood (REML) 
285 
analysis. All p-values presented in this paper were extracted from each REML analysis and an 
286 
estimated LSD, as per Andrist-Rangel et al. [40], was used to assess treatment differences. As means 
287 
considered were based on a number of days (and hours within a day), this should have mostly reduced 
288 
errors associated with the measurements/calculations.  
289 
3. Results 
290 
3.1. Environmental and substrate moisture content (SMC) conditions 
291 
For the period in which data collection coincided in both seasons (24 July to 31 August) mean daily 
292 
Tmax/Tmin in 2012 and 2013 were 22.5oC/12.6oC and 23.1oC/13.2oC, respectively. Temperatures for the 
293 
first thirteen days of the experimental season in 2013 were, however, part of heatwave-like weather 
294 
experienced in the UK in July 2013 (mean daily Tmax/Tmin for that period were 27.6oC/15.2oC).  
295 
Despite Sempervivum’s plots receiving the lowest amount of water, their SMC was generally the 
296 
highest (as a result of their low transpiration), particularly in 2013, where Sempervivum’s SMC was 
297 
mostly ≥ 0.30 m3 m-3. For the remaining treatments, mean SMC varied between 0.15-0.32 m3 m-3, in 
298 
both years (data not shown). 
299 
3.2. Plant structure 
300 
Of the genotypes tested, Salvia planted in 2012 was the tallest (Table 3) with a high LAI recorded in 
301 
both years. The specimens of this species planted in 2013 were shorter, but also had relatively high 
302 
LAI values. Sempervivum and Sedum had the shortest stature with relatively low LAI, although the 
303 
LAI of Sempervivum increased between the two years (Table 3). In contrast, both Stachys and yellow 
304 
Heuchera plots had lower LAI in the second year compared to the first. In plots with yellow 
305 
Heuchera, the LAI reduction between 2012 and 2013 was particularly dramatic; this was due to many 
306 
plants perishing during winter. By 2013, the yellow Heuchera plots had the lowest LAI (Table 3). 
307 

 
 
 
14 
 
 
 
3.3.  Short-wave reflectance (albedo, Į, and spectral reflectance) 
308 
The Į of most plant plots remained unaltered throughout the two-year period (Table 3). There was, 
309 
however, a marked reduction in Į of yellow Heuchera plots, with its 2012 value of 0.27 falling to 0.14 
310 
in 2013. Again, this is the result of the severe reduction in plant cover, which left bare substrate, with 
311 
its lower Į, in particular when wet, exposed. The Į of Sempervivum plots was also slightly altered 
312 
from 2012 to 2013, increasing from 0.14 to 0.17 (Table 3), as in 2013 Sempervivum plants were 
313 
covering the substrate fully. In uncovered plots, the average Į was lower in 2012 than in 2013 (Table 
314 
3), probably due to small SMC differences during the days when Į was measured. 
315 
An evaluation of spectral reflectance (in the short-wave spectrum) in 2012 showed that the yellow 
316 
Heuchera plants reflected more radiation than other canopies in the visible wavelengths whilst the 
317 
purple Heuchera plants reflected less (400-700 nm; Figure 3). At longer wavelengths (700 to 1250 
318 
nm; the near infrared region), reflectance was generally greater; differences between genotypes were 
319 
more spread in these wavelengths than in the visible spectrum, where only Heucheras plants had 
320 
different reflectance (Figure 3). Bare substrate on average reflected less radiation than the plants 
321 
throughout most of the short-wave spectrum; however, in the visible part of the spectrum, bare 
322 
substrate reflected more than purple Heuchera plants.  
323 
[Insert Table 3 and Figure 3] 
324 
3.4. Leaf stomatal conductance (gs) 
325 
Salvia had the highest mean gs values, with the new Salvia treatment planted in 2013 having a similar 
326 
mean gs to that of Salvia planted in 2012. Sedum had the lowest gs (p<0.001), with mean values 
327 
differing by 249 mmol m-2 s-1 in 2012 and 185 mmol m-2 s-1 in 2013 from those of Salvia planted in 
328 
2012 (Figure 4). Due to time restrictions, the number of gs measurements executed in 2013 was 
329 
substantially lower than in 2012, this might have contributed (along with differences in the stages of 
330 
plant maturity or differences in the environmental conditions at the time of measuring) to most 
331 
treatments having slightly lower mean gs values in 2013 than in 2012. Despite this, the order of 
332 
magnitude of the mean gs for the five species has not changed between the two years (Figure 4).

3.5. Surface temperature (Ts) and outgoing long-wave radiation (Lo) 
335 
Ts and related Lo in 2012 and 2013 are presented in Figure 5 (showing days with Tmax > 24oC, when 
336 
the differences in Ts and Lo were greatest). During the day, particularly between 12:00-16:00 h, plots 
337 
with Salvia or Stachys had the lowest Ts, and Lo, whereas plots with Sempervivum or bare substrate 
338 
had the highest (p>0.001); differences between mean values during that period reached up to 10oC 
339 
and 12% (or ~65 W m-2) for Ts and Lo, respectively. Values for Ts, and related values for Lo, of purple 
340 
Heuchera and Sedum were generally in-between the values of the other four treatments. The 
341 
differences between mean Ts and Lo for purple Heuchera or Sedum plots and those with Salvia 
342 
reached up to 5oC and 6% (or ~30 W m-2), respectively. In 2012, Ts and Lo values for yellow 
343 
Heuchera plots were similar to those obtained for Salvia and Stachys plots (Figures 5a and c). In 
344 
contrast, in 2013 after the loss of many of the yellow Heuchera plants, mean Ts and Lo in yellow 
345 
Heuchera plots between 12:00-16:00 h were up by 4oC and 5% (or ~25 W m-2), respectively, 
346 
compared to plots with Salvia and Stachys (Figures 5b and d).  
347 
Between 20:00-24:00 h, differences in Ts and Lo among treatments, while statistically significant in 
348 
2013 (p<0.001, data not shown), were within 2oC or ~10 W m-2. As expected, as a result of a lack of 
349 
short-wave radiation and transpiration during night-time, Ts and Lo differences between the species 
350 
were much smaller than during the day. Similar behaviour should be observed for these plants if they 
351 
were installed on green roofs. 
352 
3.6. Energy balance 
353 
3.6.1. Net radiation (Rn) 
354 
Differences in Rn between treatments were generally less pronounced than the Lo differences. This 
355 
was due to the small Į differences between most plant treatments (Table 3), which resulted in small 
356 
differences in So (data not shown), that counterbalanced the Lo differences. In 2012, Rn differences 
357 
between treatments were not significant (p=0.137, Figure 6a). In contrast, in 2013, Rn differences 
358 
were larger between 11:00-15:00 h, with Sempervivum plots having significantly lower mean Rn 
359 
(11%) than plots with Stachys and Sedum (p<0.001, Figure 6b).  
360 

 
 
 
16 
 
 
 
3.6.2. Sensible heat flux (H) 
361 
Despite clear differences between most curves being visible in Figs 6c and 6d, treatments had no 
362 
overall significant effect on H between 11:00-15:00 h in 2012 (p=0.308, Figure 6c). However,  H 
363 
differences were statistically significant in 2013 (p<0.001, Figure 6d). Stachys and Salvia had lowest 
364 
H values during daylight hours, whereas Sempervivum and purple Heuchera had the highest. 
365 
3.6.3. Substrate heat flux (G) and substrate insulation potential 
366 
Between 11:00-15:00 h, G was significantly different between treatments for both years (p<0.001, 
367 
Figures 6e and f). Greatest G values were associated with the bare substrate. During 2013 (Figure 6f), 
368 
the plots with yellow Heuchera, Sempervivum and Sedum had high daytime G, in comparison to plots 
369 
covered by other canopies. Therefore, in terms of substrate insulation potential, which we defined as 
370 
the reduction in (surface) ground heat flux by vegetation cover compared to bare substrate, Heuchera, 
371 
Sempervivum and Sedum had the lowest potential and the other (non-succulent) species the highest. 
372 
3.6.4. Latent heat flux (LE) 
373 
Despite noticeable differences in LE being apparent for a number of treatments between 11:00-15:00 
374 
h in 2012 (p=0.071, Figure 6g), they were only statistically significant in 2013 (p<0.001, Figure 6h). 
375 
This is largely caused by the fact that these curves are based on hourly averages for 10 (year 2012) 
376 
and 9 (year 2013) days, respectively, so that there will be a relatively large standard deviation (not 
377 
shown in plots, but influencing the p-values) for each hour, for each treatment. In 2013 in particular, 
378 
the overall differences in H and G between treatments led to Salvia and Stachys plots having a 
379 
significantly greater LE (as derived from Eq. 10) than plots with Sempervivum, bare substrate and 
380 
both Heucheras.  
381 
[Insert Figure 5] 
382 
3.6.5. Overall ranking in daytime energy fluxes 
383 
For the most part, differences between treatments tended to be more significant in 2013, reflecting 
384 
increased canopy maturity and hence increased substrate coverage. The exception was yellow 
385 

 
 
 
17 
 
 
 
Heuchera, where the winter deaths of plants increased the proportion of bare substrate in the plots, 
386 
with subsequent effects on the plots’ thermodynamic behaviour.  
387 
Overall, Salvia and Stachys had proportionally low values of H and G; and conversely, high values of 
388 
LE. The opposite was true for bare substrate and Sempervivum. As a consequence, the partitioning of 
389 
Rn into the different heat fluxes differed between treatments. In 2013, for example, the amount of Rn 
390 
used for H, G and LE between 11:00-15:00 h in Salvia plots planted in 2012 was respectively on 
391 
average 0%, 3% and 96% whilst for Sempervivum plots, those percentages were respectively 25%, 
392 
18% and 57% (Table 4). The percentage of Rn allocated to each of the heat fluxes was intermediate in 
393 
Sedum and Heuchera plots. Although plots with purple Heuchera had similar H values to those with 
394 
Sempervivum, purple Heuchera plots had one of the lowest diurnal G in 2013. In the second year, 
395 
purple Heuchera plots had on average a ~65 W m-2 reduction in G, compared to Sempervivum plots 
396 
(Figure 6f). Consequently, in 2013, the amount of Rn used for G in plots with purple Heuchera was on 
397 
average 15% lower than in those with Sempervivum, and so in purple Heuchera plots, this extra 
398 
amount of energy received was instead mainly released as LE (Table 4). 
399 
In 2012, yellow Heuchera plots showed some of the lowest H and G and highest LE between 11:00-
400 
15:00 h, data similar to Salvia and Stachys (Figures 6c, e, g and Table 4). However, in 2013, due to 
401 
plant death, yellow Heuchera plots had on average ~65 W m-2 greater H and G and ~130 W m-2 lower 
402 
LE than plots with Salvia planted in 2012 (Figures 6d,f,h). Therefore, in 2013 the percentage of Rn 
403 
used for H, G and LE in yellow Heuchera plots differed on average by +14%, +15% and -29%, 
404 
respectively, from the percentages allocated for H, G and LE in plots with Salvia (Table 4).   
405 
Sedum plots, on the other hand, had in both years H and LE values that were in-between those 
406 
calculated for Salvia and Stachys and for Sempervivum and purple Heuchera. However, G values in 
407 
Sedum plots were closer to those derived for Sempervivum plots than for Salvia and Stachys plots 
408 
(Figures 6e and f). For example, in 2013, G between 11:00-15:00 h was on average up to ~45 W m-2 
409 
greater in Sedum plots than in Salvia plots. This contributed to a 9% increase in the amount of Rn used 
410 
for G in plots with Sedum, compared to those with Salvia planted in 2012. Accordingly, the energy 
411 

 
 
 
18 
 
 
 
used by Sedum plots for LE was reduced on average by 20%, compared to Salvia plots in that year 
412 
(Table 4).  
413 
3.6.6. Overall ranking in night-time energy fluxes 
 
414 
At night, (20:00-24:00 h), there were no significant treatment differences in LE (p>0.152, data not 
415 
shown), and the absolute differences in Rn, H and G, although significant (p<0.001, data not shown) 
416 
were lower than those shown during the day. For nights with Tmin > 12oC, most vegetated plots, except 
417 
those with Sempervivum and yellow Heuchera (in 2013), were gaining more H than plots with bare 
418 
substrate. Furthermore, as expected, at night the upward G (i.e. heat loss) for bare substrate was 
419 
significantly higher than the G calculated for plots that were completely covered by canopies (hence 
420 
excluding yellow Heuchera in 2013). Average differences in H and G between vegetated plots and 
421 
bare substrate plots from 20:00-24:00 h reached ~25 W m-2 and ~45 W m-2, respectively. Average 
422 
differences in H and G between vegetated plots alone within the same period were smaller: ~20 W m-2 
423 
and ~30 W m-2, respectively.  
424 
 [Insert Figure 6 and Table 4] 
425 
4. Discussion 
426 
Previous studies suggest that by extending the area covered by irrigated green roofs within a city, 
427 
local daytime LE in the summer can be increased. Consequently, there is a reduction in both the heat 
428 
that is absorbed/stored within buildings and the heat that is returned to the atmosphere (as sensible 
429 
heat and long-wave radiation) [41,42] and hence, local air temperatures are lower. Thus, the presence 
430 
of rooftop vegetation provides important air temperature reduction and building insulation during 
431 
summer. Despite this study not being conducted at roof top level and having plots sizes smaller than 
432 
typical extensive green roofs, the findings are notable in that they demonstrate that certain plants have 
433 
the potential to offer more environmental cooling and substrate insulation than others. This challenges 
434 
conventional thinking on the way most green roofs are currently designed, as plants (on extensive and 
435 
semi-extensive roofs, with shallow occasionally irrigated substrates) are mostly selected for their 
436 
survival potential and not for their ability to provide valuable ecosystem services. In essence, many 
437 

 
 
 
19 
 
 
 
existing green roofs could be underperforming with regards to insulating against incoming solar 
438 
radiation, and reducing air temperatures around buildings. 
439 
4.1. Differences in summertime environmental cooling and substrate insulation potential between 
440 
treatments during the warmest period of the day 
441 
Canopies formed by non-succulent, light-coloured plants with high gs (Figure 3) and high LAI (e.g. 
442 
Salvia, regardless of its canopy height, and Stachys) showed the greatest potential for daytime 
443 
environmental cooling. This was evident in the lowest surface temperatures, and related lowest Lo and 
444 
H (Figure 5 and 6) and in the highest LE values for plots with these species (Figure 6). These canopies 
445 
also showed the greatest potential to offer more substrate insulation in hot periods, by having the 
446 
lowest G (Figure 6). In contrast, succulent plants with low gs and extremely thick leaves (e.g. 
447 
Sempervivum) showed the lowest substrate insulation potential, and offered no environmental cooling 
448 
service compared to bare substrate. A thin layer of substrate can in itself offer more thermal insulation 
449 
to roofs than common standard roof materials [43] and has significantly lower daytime surface 
450 
temperatures than materials such as concrete, gravel or black membrane [11]. As such, the use of 
451 
plants which offer greater reduction in substrate heat flux, heat-deflecting and evapotranspiration 
452 
potential than bare substrate is likely to considerably improve the cooling performance of a roof 
453 
surface compared to conventional roof systems during the summer months. Consequently, if 
454 
occasional irrigation (even in climates such as that of the UK/northern Europe where summer rainfall 
455 
is fairly regular) is supplied such that Salvia, Stachys and species with similar traits can thrive on a 
456 
roof environment, then their (and similar) canopies could be ideal candidates in helping reduce the 
457 
heat load to buildings and perhaps the negative effects of the UHI at a local scale. Due to the small 
458 
size of the plots used in this study and a number of other confounding factors, including typical air 
459 
movement characteristics around the building envelope, the implications of these differences cannot 
460 
yet be assessed at the building and urban scales. However, this could be a subject for follow-on 
461 
empirical evaluations, where these data could be used to provide more accurate plant-based 
462 
parameters within existing urban heat models (see Conclusions). 
463 

 
 
 
20 
 
 
 
The cooling and insulating properties of other canopies (Heuchera and Sedum) were intermediate. 
464 
The potential of the yellow-leaved Heuchera to offer the same summertime substrate insulation and 
465 
environmental cooling as Salvia and Stachys was evident in 2012. This was due to this genotype 
466 
possessing a high Į and moderate LAI and gs. This Heuchera cultivar, however, was not as resilient as 
467 
Salvia and Stachys, suffering tissue damage and die-back during the winter of 2012/2013, so by the 
468 
summer of 2013 plots were only partially covered. During 2013, plots with yellow Heuchera had 
469 
therefore higher Lo, H and G and lower LE than those plots covered by Salvia and Stachys, with 
470 
values actually approaching those of bare substrate. Plants that are poorly adapted to harsh conditions 
471 
should, therefore, be avoided in unprotected spaces such as rooftops, despite having traits that would 
472 
in theory lead to maximum environmental cooling and substrate insulation in the summer.  
473 
In contrast, purple Heuchera survived well in all weather conditions in our experiment. Data here 
474 
suggests that purple-leaved, non-succulent plants could insulate the substrate from external heat to the 
475 
same extent as Salvia and Stachys. G in purple Heuchera plots was similar to that in Salvia and 
476 
Stachys plots once plants reached a certain height (Figure 6). This was possibly because an air gap 
477 
was created between the lower leaves of the canopy and the substrate in 2013 [27], thereby reducing 
478 
the temperature gradient between leaves, substrate surface and within the substrate, i.e. the driving 
479 
force for G. However, plants with dark-coloured leaves are best avoided as they do not offer 
480 
additional environmental cooling. Although the Į of purple and green leaves was within the same 
481 
range in this case, the spectral reflectance showed that purple leaves absorbed more visible radiation 
482 
than others. There is a large amount of energy per quantum in the visible wavelengths [44], hence 
483 
purple Heuchera leaves were consistently absorbing more energy than green or yellow ones. This 
484 
contributes to greater warming of purple leaves than other non-succulent leaf types [20]. In highly 
485 
urbanised regions, the effect that green roofs may have on temperatures of the surrounding 
486 
environment (air and urban fabric) can become important. Accordingly, cultivars that offer both 
487 
maximum environmental cooling and minimum substrate warming in the summer should be preferred.  
488 
Sedum, the most commonly used plants on extensive green roofs, was shown to be less effective than 
489 
other plants in its environmental cooling and substrate insulation potential, with the other succulent, 
490 

 
 
 
21 
 
 
 
Sempervivum, performing even worse. These plants are popular due to their xerophytic traits and an 
491 
ability to survive on very shallow substrate on green roofs without supplementary irrigation. Not 
492 
surprisingly, however, their characteristic small leaves, designed to minimise water loss, compromise 
493 
their suitability where cooling and shading are important. Although often marketed for their 
494 
ecosystem service potential, the results presented here indicate that, while Sedum offers a small 
495 
cooling/insulation benefit over bare substrate (and most likely a modestly larger benefit compared to 
496 
roofing material), they do not perform as well as some other plants. Particularly in terms of substrate 
497 
insulation potential, Salvia outperformed Sedum, as G was reduced by up to ~45 W m-2 in plots with 
498 
Salvia compared to plots with Sedum. Although these findings need to be confirmed at the building 
499 
scale, they indicate that plants such as Salvia would be better suited than Sedum carpets to be used in 
500 
green roofs where reducing the building heat load in the summer is a priority. 
501 
4.2. Main plant traits linked to cooling of the surrounding environment and substrate insulation 
502 
during the day 
503 
Lo, H and LE are dependent on surface temperatures but also influence the surface temperatures 
504 
themselves. Consequently, those plant traits that contribute most to lowering leaf temperatures during 
505 
hot periods also play the largest role in reducing the Lo and H and increasing the LE release into their 
506 
surroundings, hence leading to enhanced environmental cooling. Based on our findings [see also 20], 
507 
it can be suggested that there are a number of specific traits that are key for the reduction of heat 
508 
release into the environment. They include high values of gs, high LAI, light leaf colour and low 
509 
values of leaf thickness. Additionally, as shown by this study and by indirect evidence from other 
510 
studies [e.g. 29], some of these traits also ensure the largest reduction in G, and so the highest ability 
511 
to potentially provide summertime substrate insulation; (i) in particular high LAI, through increased 
512 
shading, and (ii) high gs, by reducing the energy available for G, as a result of large LE.  
513 
4.3. Differences in night-time cooling/insulation potential between treatments 
514 
Although night-time surface temperatures and heat flux differences were less pronounced than during 
515 
the day, surface temperatures for Salvia, Purple Heuchera and Stachys between 20:00-24:00 h were 
516 

 
 
 
22 
 
 
 
still significantly lower than for bare substrate or Sempervivum. This indicates that the environmental 
517 
cooling potentially offered by canopies such as Salvia and Stachys during the day may extend to the 
518 
early night period. 
519 
In contrast, at night during the summer, bare substrate allowed more heat to be released (Figure 6e 
520 
and f) from the substrate layer than the majority of vegetated plots. This inevitably suggests that if the 
521 
canopies studied were covering a rooftop, less heat would escape the building at night under green 
522 
roof vegetation, leading to reduced regulation of temperatures inside the building during hot nights. 
523 
However, semi-extensive roofs - for which the plants we studied would be suitable - are more likely 
524 
to be deployed on commercial buildings, where daytime temperatures are the main issue. We 
525 
therefore argue that there is an overall summer insulation benefit to using vegetation. 
526 
4.4. Research limitations 
527 
The heat fluxes calculated within this study, particularly LE which was derived from other 
528 
estimations, may be subject to errors linked to the data collection or the assumptions made during the 
529 
calculations. A potential shortcoming of the results we reported may be linked with the fact that an 
530 
explicit advective term (i.e. characterized by the horizontal divergence of H, when H is negative and 
531 
large enough that a downward H is produced at the ground during the daytime [36,45]) was not 
532 
included in the energy balance calculations. Instead, advection is implicitly embedded in the LE 
533 
estimation. To test whether the relative differences among the latent fluxes for the different plant 
534 
species would remain once an advective term was taken into consideration, further calculations were 
535 
carried out based on the (micro) advection theory and equations provided in [36] (data not shown). 
536 
Comparisons between both LE estimations revealed some differences in the absolute flux values but 
537 
not in the ranking of Salvia, Stachys and Sedum (Sempervivum and bare substrate were excluded as 
538 
we did not have surface resistances required to calculate the advective LE term).  
539 
Another point to consider is the fact that air will gradually change its properties to achieve a new 
540 
equilibrium when flowing over a (vegetated) surface, and so non-equilibrium conditions were likely 
541 
for our small experimental surfaces. Furthermore, small plots such as the ones used here are prone to 
542 
edge effects [46]. If the air arriving at the edge of the plot is drier and warmer than the air that would 
543 

 
 
 
23 
 
 
 
be in equilibrium with a similarly vegetated plot of sufficient size, then the horizontal transport of heat 
544 
may overwhelm any local effects of evaporative cooling. Energy exchanges identified in small plots 
545 
may not therefore be entirely representative of those observed in real life situations [36]. 
546 
Other potential sources of error lay with the measurements themselves. One example is seen in the 
547 
wind speed measurements, used in the estimation of H via ra. Here wind speed values from the 
548 
University of Reading’s registered meteorological station (approx. 600 m away from the experimental 
549 
plots) were used, rather than the data from the somewhat less sophisticated weather station at the 
550 
experimental plots. The University meteorological station is located in a more exposed area than the 
551 
experimental plots, so although wind speeds at both sites were broadly in agreement, wind speeds at 
552 
the meteorological station were slightly higher. Any errors due to an overestimation of wind speed 
553 
were, however, equally applied to all treatments. In addition, any inaccuracies in other measurements 
554 
due to limited instrument precision may also have resulted in other slight under/overestimations. 
555 
Errors in the calculations, due to an error in the measurement of variables such as Ta, Li and Si should 
556 
also be similar for all treatments. The errors linked to temperature measurements made with different 
557 
individual thermocouples attached to leaves or substrate surface and thermistors placed within the 
558 
substrate layer could indeed have influenced the relative differences in fluxes found, as the 
559 
temperatures measured by the sensors could have differed by up to 0.3oC (based on the identified 
560 
precision error). However, we suggest that the overall differences in surface temperatures and fluxes 
561 
between treatments were large enough to indicate that different canopies will have different substrate 
562 
insulation and environmental cooling ability. 
563 
We therefore argue that although most limitations we outlined will have had some influence on the 
564 
absolute flux values, they did not change the relative differences between treatments on which our 
565 
conclusions are based.  
566 
5. Conclusions 
567 
Climate change predictions suggest that heat waves will increase in frequency and intensity in the 
568 
future, so the summertime temperature regulation provided by plants on green roofs, and indeed 
569 
elsewhere, green walls, street trees etc. [47], will become increasingly valuable. This study indicates 
570 

 
 
 
24 
 
 
 
that different types of plants significantly differ in their cooling and insulation benefits during hot 
571 
periods, when it is most needed. Our results suggest that plants such as Salvia and Stachys, which 
572 
possess key traits required for a reduction in Lo, H and G and an increase in LE (i.e. have typically 
573 
high gs when sufficiently watered, high LAI, leaves with light leaf colour and reflective, and thin 
574 
leaves) may have an important role to play a role in cooling the surrounding environment and 
575 
improving the daytime thermal insulation of buildings in the summer, and thus should be given more 
576 
consideration when planning green roof plant communities. 
577 
Looking ahead, the implications for the energy consumption of buildings and for the overall 
578 
temperatures in the urban environment of using the studied plant species on green roofs still need to 
579 
be assessed. It is well known that typical green roof interventions have the potential to reduce heat 
580 
entering buildings and reduce the energy used to regulate internal building temperatures in the 
581 
summer, although recently the unequivocal thermal benefits of green roofs have been challenged, for 
582 
example by [13]. Notwithstanding, on the basis of our study we hypothesise that plants such as Salvia 
583 
and Stachys, which offer added substrate insulation potential during the day in the summer compared 
584 
to typical green roof cover, could lead to a considerable decrease in the heat gained by a building 
585 
during that period, when covering its roof. An extrapolation of these preliminary findings to total 
586 
savings in the energy consumed by a building would need to account also for the winter effects, the 
587 
local climate and the building construction, among other aspects. This hypothesis needs therefore to 
588 
be confirmed by a broader-scale evaluation. Models such as EnergyPlus have been developed to 
589 
predict energy consumptions in buildings. These models have been used to test the performance of 
590 
green roofs based on the parameterisation of substrate and plant characteristics, such as substrate 
591 
thermal properties, substrate depth, gs, h, LAI and Į [13,48]. Now that we have collected a detailed set 
592 
of plant parameters for a range of contrasting canopies, we propose that future research could use 
593 
available models to investigate the level of such savings for buildings under a range of climate 
594 
conditions. Furthermore, a number of models are available to study the impact of greening on the 
595 
microclimate within the urban environment (e.g. ENVI-met, [49]) and, using our data, these could be 
596 

 
 
 
25 
 
 
 
used next to assess the green roof area necessary to make a significant impact on air temperatures at a 
597 
city scale, initially in a temperate climate.  
598 
Based on the evidence we collected, we argue that new urban planning policies should take much 
599 
greater consideration of plant choice, when attempting to maximise ecosystem services provision. Not 
600 
all components of green infrastructure provide the same benefits, and plant genotype choice within 
601 
this infrastructure, can strongly determine the type and level of benefits provided. This paper deals 
602 
with green roof scenarios, but we are aware of parallel work on trees which suggests that some 
603 
species have four times the cooling potential of others [50]. This paper challenges the notion that 
604 
Sedum and other succulents commonly used on green roofs are able to provide a viable summer 
605 
cooling and insulating benefit, and suggests that alternative species, with greater functionality, are 
606 
preferable. This involves providing these new genotypes with adequate ‘support’ systems (e.g. 
607 
supplementary irrigation) if that is what is required to ensure effective environmental cooling and 
608 
substrate insulation in the summer. Our ongoing research is looking into sustainable ways to provide 
609 
the water required by these more water-demanding plants and the added costs of such installation. 
610 
Indeed, through more appropriate choice of plants and by extending the scale of plantings, positive 
611 
impacts at a city scale may be feasible.

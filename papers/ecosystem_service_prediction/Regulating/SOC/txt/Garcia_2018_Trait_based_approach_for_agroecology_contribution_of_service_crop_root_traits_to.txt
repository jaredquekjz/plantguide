Abstract
Aims The aim of this study was to explore the impact of soil management strategies and the contribution of root traits of
plant communities and soil organic carbon (SOC) in explaining soil aggregate stability in vineyards.
Methods We measured topsoil aggregate stability, soil properties and root traits of 38 plant communities in an experimental
vineyard, previously subjected to different soil management strategies. Then we investigated statistical relations between
aggregate stability, root traits and SOC and estimated root trait and SOC contributions to gain insight into aggregate
stability.
Results Soil management strategies strongly affected soil aggregate stability, with a negative effect of tillage, even after
several years of service crop cover. Among the investigated parameters, soil organic carbon was found to contribute the
most to aggregate stability. Root mean diameter and root mass density showed positive correlations with aggregate stability,
while speciﬁc root length showed a negative correlation with aggregate stability.
Conclusions Soil aggregate stability is the result of complex interactions between soil management strategies, soil properties
and plant root traits. Service crops improve aggregate stability, and a trait-based approach could help to identify service
crop ideotypes and expand the pool of species of interest for providing services in agroecosystems in relation with the soil
physical quality.

Introduction
Agricultural soils are currently affected by various is-
sues related to erosion, loss of soil organic carbon and
poor soil structure, especially with respect to perennial
crops (Don et al., 2011; Poeplau and Don, 2013; Panagos
et al., 2015). In particular, vineyard soil quality is strongly
impacted by the soil management strategies, as frequent
tillage performed to limit competition between weeds and
grapevine exacerbates soil erosion (García-Díaz et al., 2017;
Novara et al., 2011), especially on steep slopes (Panagos
et al., 2015; Le Bissonnais et al., 2002). Moreover, tillage im-
pairs soil organic matter and alters the soil structure (Six
et al., 1999; Coll et al., 2011; Salomé et al., 2016). Viticulture
has thus been shown to be one of the most erosion-prone
types of land use (Cerdan et al., 2010; Panagos et al., 2015;
García-Ruiz, 2010). Soil loss and associated fertility loss in
vineyards directly threaten the sustainability of grape pro-
duction systems, so adopting a soil conservation strategy
is a major issue in viticulture.
Growing service crops is a major feature in soil conser-
vation strategies. These crops are grown with the aim of
providing non-marketed ecosystem services (Garcia et al.,
2018), e.g. to increase soil organic matter and fertility,
maintain the soil structure, control weeds, while limiting
erosion, pests and diseases (Lu et al., 2000; Zhang et al.,
2007; Médiène et al., 2011; Blanco-Canqui et al., 2015; Gaba
et al., 2015). In soils, service crops prevent water and wind
erosion (Durán Zuazo and Rodríguez Pleguezuelo, 2008;
Blavet et al., 2009; De Baets et al., 2011; Ruiz-Colmenero
et al., 2013; David et al., 2014). These crops also directly
protect the soil from rainsplash, and reduce excessive
amounts of soil surface water and associated runoff gene-
sis and velocity by favoring soil inﬁltration and increasing
the soil surface roughness (Dabney et al., 2001; Celette
et al., 2008; Gaudin et al., 2010; Gumiere et al., 2011). Ser-
vice crops also improve the stability of soil aggregates,
i.e. their resistance to breakdown, and thus maintenance
of a good soil structure and inﬁltration. Several studies
have highlighted the beneﬁts of service crops for aggregate
stability in vineyards (Goulet et al., 2004; Ferrero et al.,
2004; Peregrina et al., 2010; Ruiz-Colmenero et al., 2013),
but few studies have compared the respective roles of
root traits and soil properties in stabilizing soils in such
agroecosystems.
Among soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) has
been shown to be one of the main explanatory factors
with regard to soil aggregate stability (Tisdall and Oades,
1

Garcia et al. (2019) Trait-based approach for agroecology: contribution of service crop root traits to explain soil aggregate stability in vineyards
1982; Six and Paustian, 2014), and no-tillage agriculture is
known to promote soil aggregate stability as it increases
SOC (Six et al., 2004). SOC improves ﬂocculation of clay
particles and forms binding agents with clay and poly-
valent cations that increase particle cohesion (Tisdall and
Oades, 1982; Six et al., 2004; Abiven et al., 2009). Bonds be-
tween clay particles and carbohydrates of bacteria capsules
or with fungal hyphae also participate in soil cohesion
(Tisdall and Oades, 1982). Moreover, SOC and microbial
activity increase the hydrophobicity of aggregates, thus re-
ducing their sensitivity to breakdown by water (Cosentino
et al., 2006; Abiven et al., 2009). Bacteria and fungi also
produce extracellular polysaccharides that bind soil parti-
cles, and fungal hyphae physically enmesh soil particles
and thus protect them from alteration (Tisdall and Oades,
1982; Six et al., 2004; Cosentino et al., 2006; Abiven et al.,
2009, 2007).
The action of roots in the soil stabilization process in-
volves physical, chemical, and biotic interactions with soil
particles. Physical action consists of aggregate enmesh-
ment by ﬁne roots that maintains the aggregate structure
and protects it from breakdown (Jastrow et al., 1998; Fat-
tet et al., 2011; Pérès et al., 2013; Le Bissonnais et al.,
2017).
Roots also increase the soil wetting-drying fre-
quency, which contributes to strengthening the soil ag-
gregates (Angers and Caron, 1998; Czarnes et al., 2000).
The chemical action of roots on soil stability is mainly
due to root exudation of sugars, carbohydrates, organic
and amino acids into soils (Bardgett et al., 2014). These
compounds act as glue for mineral particles and strongly
contribute to building stable soil aggregates (Six et al.,
2004; Pérès et al., 2013). Bardgett et al. (2014) state that
root exudation may be the root trait with the greatest
impact on soil stability. The biotic action of roots con-
sists of stimulating microbial biomass in soil and forming
associations with symbiotic fungi whose hyphae and exu-
dates increase soil aggregate stability (Jastrow et al., 1998;
Hamilton and Frank, 2001). The effect of roots in soil
stabilization mainly depends on their density in soils and
their nature, i.e. ﬁne roots versus coarse roots (Freschet
and Roumet, 2017). Studying root traits thus seems rele-
vant to better understand the role of roots in driving soil
aggregate stability.
Trait-based approaches have recently been developed to
assess the potential of service crops in providing speciﬁc
ecosystem services in agroecosystems and consequently
choosing the best-suited species according to targeted
services (Damour et al., 2014; Tardy et al., 2015; Tribouil-
lois et al., 2015). Such approaches may help understand
the functioning and dynamics of plant communities un-
der various environments, and predict how ecosystem
services vary across agroecosystems (Duarte et al., 1995;
Martin and Isaac, 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Damour et al.,
2018). The effect of root traits on soil aggregate stability
has already been shown in grasslands and natural plant
communities, along with environmental gradients, with
ﬁndings of positive effects of root density and speciﬁc root
length (SRL) on aggregate stability (Erktan et al., 2016;
Gould et al., 2016; Ali et al., 2017; Le Bissonnais et al.,
2017). However, to our knowledge, the respective roles
of roots and soil properties have been barely studied in
agroecosystems with low organic inputs.
The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of
root traits and soil organic carbon in driving soil aggregate
stability in vineyards after contrasted soil management
strategies. We therefore measured topsoil aggregate stabil-
ity, soil properties and root traits of 38 plant communities
in an experimental vineyard, previously subjected to dif-
ferent previous soil management. The plant communities
consisted of 13 service crop species sown in the inter-rows
and spontaneous species growing amongst the service
crops. Considering the small spatial footprint of the exper-
iment, we assumed that there was little variability in the
soil mineral phase. For these conditions, we hypothesized
that: i) vinegrowers’ soil management drives soil aggre-
gate stability through its effect on soil organic carbon and
mechanical disturbances, ii) service crop root traits con-
tribute to explaining soil aggregate stability in vineyards
and they contribute more than soil properties due to low
carbon content in these soils (Erktan et al., 2016; Le Bis-
sonnais et al., 2017), and iii) graminoids have a stronger
positive effect on aggregate stability than legumes due to
their higher SRL and root density (Pérès et al., 2013; Gould
et al., 2016; Roumet et al., 2016).

Material and methods
2.1.
Experimental site and design
The experiment was carried out from 2012 to 2017 in a
vineyard located near Montpellier (Domaine du Chapitre)
in the south of France (43◦31’55"N 3◦51’51"E). The area
is under a Mediterranean climate with mean annual rain-
fall of about 550 mm (2013-2017). The soil is a calcaric
cambisol (30% clay, 40% silt and 30% sand) with a 5%
stone content. Grapevines (V.vinifera L. cv. Mourvèdre
and Grenache) were planted in 2008 at a density of 4,000
vines per hectare (2.5 m x 1 m). They were trained using a
midwire bilateral cordon system and were spur pruned to
12 nodes per vine. Mechanical weed control was applied
under the vine rows. Three different soil management
strategies were used in inter-rows at random locations in
the experimental ﬁeld: some had been tilled since 2012 (T)
while others had been sown with service crops each year
since 2012 (SC) and some of the latter were tilled the year
before the last growing season (SCT). The term “soil man-
agement strategy” refers to past inter-row management
before the last growing season (Table 1). All inter-rows

Garcia et al. (2019) Trait-based approach for agroecology: contribution of service crop root traits to explain soil aggregate stability in vineyards
were sown with service crops during the 2016-2017 grow-
ing season.
In September 2016, all inter-rows were tilled for seedbed
preparation. 13 different monocultures of service crop
species were sown in inter-rows of 30m length and 2
m wide at random locations in the experimental ﬁeld.
Three inter-rows were sown for each service crop species.
Species were chosen to have a diversity of botanical fami-
lies (Fabaceae, Poaceae, Plantaginaceae, Hydrophyllaceae,
Rosaceae, Brassicaceae), life cycles, and growing behavior
(growth rate, biomass production): Achillea millefolium,
Brassica carinata, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca ovina, Med-
icago lupulina, Medicago sativa, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Plan-
tago coronopus, Poterium sanguisorba, Secale cereale, Trifolium
fragiferum, Triticosecale and Vicia villosa. Moreover, three
inter-rows were maintained with spontaneous vegetation.
Inter-rows were sown in late September 2016 and were
destroyed at the beginning of May 2017. No weeding was
performed in the inter-rows, so we obtained plant commu-
nities composed of sown and spontaneous species (Table
S1).
2.2.
Measurements
Before grapevine budburst (April 2017), three quadrats
(0.25 m2) were placed in each inter-row, except in those
with Triticosecale and Secale cereale (2 quadrats) and Bras-
sica carinata (1 quadrat) cover, for a total of 38 quadrats.
In each quadrat, the plant communities were composed of
sown and spontaneous species (Table S1).
2.2.1.
Soil sampling
To account for the effect of soil management strategies
on soils, soil samples were collected at service crop emer-
gence in order to determine the soil organic carbon (SOC,
mg g−1), microbial biomass (MB, mg kg−1) and inorganic
nitrogen (inorgN, mg kg−1) content. Samples were col-
lected within the 0-10 cm topsoil layer in the most con-
trasted strategies (SC and T), with 10 composite samples
included in each soil management strategy. Each com-
posite sample was composed of 4 sub-samples taken in
4 adjacent inter-rows with an identical soil management
strategy.
To measure the soil aggregate stability, soil samples
were collected at grapevine budburst with a small shovel
at the soil surface of each quadrat (0-10 cm). Samples were
air-dried (∼25◦C, 72 h), sieved (3–5 mm) and stored at 5◦C
(Le Bissonnais, 1996; ISO-10930, 2012).
2.2.2.
Aggregate stability measurements
Aggregate stability was measured using the method
of Le Bissonnais (1996) (ISO-10930, 2012). Only the fast
wetting disruptive test was performed here. For the 38
quadrats, the test was performed on three soil subsamples
(10 g each). Before measurements, samples were dried
at 40◦C for 24 h. After drying, soil aggregates were im-
mersed in distilled water for 10 min, and transferred onto
a 50 µm sieve immersed in ethanol to separate >50 µm
fragments from <50 µm fragments. The >50 µm fraction
was collected, oven-dried (40◦C, 48 h) and sieved through
a column of 6 sieves (2.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.05
mm). The mean weight diameter (MWD) was calculated
to express aggregate stability, corresponding to the sum
of the mass fraction of soil remaining on each sieve mul-
tiplied by the mean diameter of the two adjacent sieves.
Coarse elements (>2 mm gravel) were weighed to correct
the MWD values.
2.2.3.
Root sampling and measurements
At budburst, all species were identiﬁed in each quadrat
and aboveground biomass was removed for root sampling.
Then two soil cores (8 cm diameter) per quadrat were
collected in the 0-10 cm topsoil layer and stored in freezer
at -20◦C before root measurement. After storage, the two
soil cores originating from a same quadrat were thawed
together in water. Roots were washed and sorted to sepa-
rate herbaceous roots from grapevine roots, which were
not used in this study. Subsamples of roots were placed
in water in a clear acrylic tray, and scanned at 600 dpi
with an Epson Perfection V800 scanner. Scanned images
were analyzed using WinRHIZO Reg software (Regent
Instruments, Quebec, Canada). Several diameter classes
were set for the analysis: each 0.1 mm from 0 to 1 mm,
each 0.5 mm from 1 to 2 mm, and the >2 mm class. The
proportion of <2 mm roots was systematically 98–100%
of the total length over all plant communities. The Win-
RHIZO software was used to calculate the total length,
surface area, volume and mean diameter of the scanned
roots, and the total length for each diameter class. Scanned
and non-scanned samples were air dried (60◦C, 72 h) and
weighed separately.
As the roots of species composing the communities
could not be differentiated, six “root functional markers”
of the communities (Damour et al., 2015) were calculated
instead of the functional traits of each species (Violle et al.,
2007). These functional markers stand for community-
aggregated traits (Garnier et al., 2004) and represent the
root traits of an average plant in this community. The
total root length was calculated with the scanned length
and dry mass and non-scanned dry mass. The root length
density (RLD, cm cm−3) and root mass density (RMD,
kg m−3) were calculated as the total root length and dry
mass divided by the soil volume, respectively. The speciﬁc
root length (SRL, m g−1) was calculated as the total root
length divided by the root dry mass, and the very ﬁne root
fraction (VFRf) was calculated as the length of roots <0.1

Statistical analysis
The effect of plant communities and soil organic carbon
on MWD was tested with ANOVA for each soil manage-
ment strategy, except for the effect of soil organic carbon
in the soil management strategy SCT (soil properties data
not available). We used the Fischer’s least signiﬁcant dif-
ference to assess for differences between communities and
with control quadrats (bare soil), for each soil management
strategy. The impact of the soil management strategies on
the soil properties, MWD and root functional markers was
tested with Kruskal-Wallis tests.
The relations between all root functional markers were
assessed with a principal component analysis (PCA) using
R package ‘FactomineR’ (Lê et al., 2008). The soil man-
agement strategy and botanical family of the dominant
species in each quadrat were included as supplementary
qualitative variables. Relations between qualitative vari-
ables and the PCA axes were assessed with a v.test (Hus-
son et al., 2017). Krustal-Wallis test were performed to
assess differences of root functional markers between soil
management strategies.
Relations between root functional markers, soil organic
carbon and soil aggregates stability were assessed with
multiple regressions and variable selection procedures, the
variable MWD as the dependent variable, root functional
markers and SOC as independent variables. We used
the R package ‘leaps’ which performs a selection of best
subsets of variables with exhaustive search, and selected
models according to their R2 and p-value. Before selecting
a model, we ﬁrst tested multicollinearity using the ‘vif’
function of the R package ‘car’ (Fox and Weisberg, 2011)
and eliminated redundant variables if necessary (VIF >
5). Then when a variable had a signiﬁcant slope in the
model, we checked its consistency with its slope in a sim-
ple regression with MWD. We thus selected best models
(R2 criterion) that were built with non-correlated variables,
and consistent with the slope of the variables in simple re-
gression with MWD. The model selection was performed
on data from soil management strategy SC only, T only,
and both. In each case, we performed model selection
with and without variable SOC in the dataset, resulting in
6 ﬁnal models. In each model, the relative contribution of
selected variables to the model R2 was assessed with the
LMG computer-intensive method that averages sequential
sums of squares over all orderings of regression variables
(‘relaimpo’ R package, Grömping (2006)). All analyses
were performed with R version 3.4.3 (Team, 2018).

(MWDSCT = 0.50 ± 0.16). Overall, MWD were low in
our experiment, ranging from 0.31 mm to 1.19 mm and
covering the “very unstable”, “unstable” and “medium
stable” classes according to Le Bissonnais (1996) (Fig. 1).
The MWD under the SC strategy covered the “unstable”
(0.4 < MWD < 0.8) and “medium stable” (0.8 < MWD <
1.3) classes, while MWD under the SCT and T strategies
covered the “very unstable” (MWD < 0.4) and “unstable”
classes, except for one quadrat. For all soil properties,
signiﬁcant differences were found between the SC and T
strategies, with higher SOC, MB and inorganic N under
the SC soil management strategy (Table 2). Overall, the
SOC content was low, ranging from 6.7 to 13.7 mg g−1
(Erktan et al., 2016).

Belowground functional characterization of ser-
vice crop communities
The PCA conducted on root functional markers ex-
plained 83.5% of the total variance on the ﬁrst two axes
(Fig. 2). The ﬁrst axis explained 51.2% of the total varia-
tion, and opposed speciﬁc root length and very ﬁne root
fraction (positive coordinates) to root mean diameter (neg-
ative coordinates), with respective contributions of 23.0%,
30.2% and 31.5%. The second axis explained 32.3% of
the total variance, with main contributions from RMD
(42.1%), RTD (24.5%) and RLD (22.7%), the three variables
being positively related to axis 2 (Fig. 2). Regarding to the
species, the ﬁrst axis opposed Fabaceae species to Poaceae,
Hydrophyllaceae and Brassicaceae species, while second
axis opposed Asteraceae and Plantaginaceae species to
Fabaceae, Brassicaceae and Rubiaceae species (Fig. 2, Ta-
ble S2). Soil management strategies were also related to
the PCA axes: ﬁrst axis opposed soil management strate-
gies SC and T while second axis opposed SC and SCT (Fig.
2, Table S2).
The ranges of functional markers variation depended
on the type of functional markers (Fig. 3). Markers related
to the soil rooting density (RLD and RMD) were more
variable than other functional markers, with coefﬁcients of
variation of 0.45 and 0.42, respectively. The mean diameter
was the least variable marker, with a coefﬁcient of variation
of 0.23 that ranged only from 0.12 to 0.28 mm. The effect of
soil management strategies was signiﬁcant for root mean
diameter, SRL and RTD.
3.3.
Service crop communities, root functional mark-
ers and MWD
In each soil management strategy, plant communities
had a signiﬁcant effect on MWD (α = 0.05, Fig. 4). The
majority of the quadrats had signiﬁcantly higher MWD
than bare soil in soil management strategies SC and T,
whereas 6 communities over 10 had similar MWD than
bare soil in soil management strategy SCT (LSD test, α =
0.05). The soil organic carbon (SOC) signiﬁcantly affected
MWD in the two soil management strategies SC and T
(α = 0.05, Fig. 4). SOC data was not available for soil
management strategy SCT.
The model selection procedure revealed different pat-
terns of relations between MWD, root functional markers
and soil organic carbon, depending on the soil manage-
ment strategy. Performed on the whole dataset (i.e. soil
management strategies SC and T), the best model included
variables SOC, root diameter (DIAM), root tissue density
(RTD) and root mass density (RMD), with respective con-
tributions of 62%, 21%, 8% and 9% to the model R2; all
slopes were positive and signiﬁcant except for RMD (Table
3). Performed on data from soil management strategy
T, the best model included SOC, DIAM, RLD, speciﬁc
root lensth (SRL) and root mass density (RMD). However,
only SOC was signiﬁcant in the model, with a positive
slope and a contribution of 80% to the model R2 (Table 3).
Using data from soil management strategy SC only, the
best model included RLD, SOC, RMD and very ﬁne root
fraction (VFRf). Slopes of SOC and RLD were signiﬁcant,
with positive and negative slopes, respectively (Table 3).
The inclusion of variable SOC strongly improved the R2
of the best models in the soil management strategy T and
over the whole dataset (SC + T).

Discussion
4.1.
Role of past soil management strategies in increas-
ing the MWD and soil quality
The overall low SOC content, which ranged from 6.7 to
13.7 mg g−1, was not surprising in our experiment (Table
2). Indeed, vineyards are often sub-fertilized or even not
fertilized to ensure berry production and quality rather
than vegetative growth, and organic restitutions are low
in these agroecosystems (Celette et al., 2009). Moreover,
soil organic matter content increases slowly (Morlat and
Jacquet, 2003), which may explain the low SOC content
in the SC soil management strategy compared with other
studies (e.g. Erktan et al. (2016)). However, SOC, MB
and inorganic N were signiﬁcantly higher in the SC soil
management strategy compared to the T soil management
strategy. The lowest values for the three soil variables,
corresponding to low soil fertility, may have been due to

input (Table 1, Table 2). Unfortunately, soil properties
were not measured in the SCT soil management strategy
for comparison with other soil management strategies.
MWD were signiﬁcantly higher under the SC soil man-
agement strategy compared with the SCT and T soil man-
agement strategies. Moreover, MWD did not signiﬁcantly
differ between the SCT and T soil management strate-
gies (Table 2). These results show that soil management
markedly impacts the soil aggregate stability, as one year
of tillage impaired the soil aggregate stability even af-
ter three years of service crops and organic inputs (root
turnover, root decomposition, mulch). The highest MWD
found in the SC soil management strategy may be partially
explained by the better soil organic matter conditions. In-
deed, SOC increases particle cohesion and the formation
of bonds with bacterial and fungal compounds that par-
ticipate in soil stabilization (Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Six
et al., 2004; Abiven et al., 2009). Microbial activity also
increases aggregate stability by the production of extracel-
lular compounds that act as binding agents between soil
particles, and by physical enmeshment of soil particles
with fungal hyphae that protect aggregates (Tisdall and
Oades, 1982; Six et al., 2004; Cosentino et al., 2006; Abiven
et al., 2009, 2007).
4.2.
Impact of root functional markers on soil aggre-
gate stability
Following the soil management strategy, the model selec-
tion procedure revealed different types of root functional
markers related to soil aggregate stability. Roots play di-
rect and indirect roles in driving soil aggregate stability:
physical enmeshment and protection of soil aggregates, ex-
udation of compounds that act as binding agents between
soil particles, stimulation of microbial biomass which also
enhances the soil aggregate stability (Jastrow et al., 1998;
Hamilton and Frank, 2001; Six et al., 2004; Gyssels et al.,
2005; Bardgett et al., 2014). In this study, the majority
of plant communities had higher aggregate stability than
bare soil (Fig. 4), however the predictive power of root
functional markers appeared marginal compared to soil
organic carbon, except for soil management strategy SC,
and the inclusion of soil organic carbon systematically
increased models R2 (Table 3).
Combining data from soil management strategy SC and
T, the best model included soil organic carbon (SOC), root
mean diameter (DIAM), root tissue density (RTD) and root
mass density (RMD, non-signiﬁcant). Highest contribu-
tions were found for variables SOC (62%) and DIAM (21%)
which had positive effect of MWD in the model (Table 3).
The positive relation between SOC and MWD is not sur-
prising, the effect of SOC on aggregate stability have been
discussed in the previous section. Erktan et al. (2016) stud-
ied soil aggregate stability along a successional gradient

of plant communities and found that mean root diameter
was positively correlated with aggregate stability. More
precisely, they found a negative relation between MWD
and the very ﬁne root fraction (<0.2 mm), and a positive
relation with the ﬁne root fraction (0.2–1 mm) which corre-
sponds to high diameter values in our experiment (mean
diameter of 0.18 mm and a third quartile value of 0.22 mm,
Fig. 3). Jastrow et al. (1998) reported that ﬁne roots be-
tween 0.2 and 1 mm had a strong effect on soil stabilization
due to their greater interaction with external hyphae and
microbial biomass, whereas very ﬁne roots, i.e. diameter
<0.2 mm, had an overall low contribution to soil stability.
Moreover, Roumet et al. (2016) highlighted a positive close
correlation between the root water-soluble concentration
and the root diameter among a majority of herbaceous
species. As the root water-soluble concentration is pos-
itively related to soil aggregate stability (Le Bissonnais
et al., 2017; Poirier et al., 2017), that could explain the pos-
itive relation between MWD and root diameter, although
we didn’t directly measure root solubles concentration in
our experiment. Root tissue density (RTD) is also related
to hemicellulose and carbon concentration (Prieto et al.,
2015; Roumet et al., 2016), and to root soluble compounds
in graminoid species (Roumet et al., 2016). These traits
have been previously related to soil aggregate formation
(Poirier et al., 2017, 2018), but measuring only the RTD
may not allow to explain MWD variations, which could
explain the low contribution of the variable in the model
(Table 3).
The separation of the dataset following soil management
strategies revealed other relations. Regarding to the soil
management strategy T only, only soil organic carbon was
signiﬁcant in the best model, with a contribution to the
model R2 of 80% (Table 3). Moreover, the R2 of the model
including SOC was strongly higher than the best model
including only root functional markers, which conﬁrms
the predominant role of SOC in aggregation processes
(Abiven et al., 2009). Regarding to the soil management
strategy SC, the root length density (RLD) contributed the
most to explain MWD, with a negative slope in the model
(Table 3). This negative relation contradicts previous re-
sults that showed a positive effect of RLD on aggregates
stability (Fattet et al., 2011; Pohl et al., 2012; Gould et al.,
2016; Le Bissonnais et al., 2017). However, in our case the
relation is mainly due to one quadrat sown with Medicago
sativa (Q27, see Table S1), which had the highest MWD
and the lowest root length density in the dataset (see Fig.
S1). The low RLD is probably due to the root system of
Medicago sativa, which had a high proportion of tap roots
in the 0-10 cm soil layer, and less total root length than
other plant communities, while the high MWD may be
due to the positive relation between root diameter and
MWD. However, the relation is too weak to suggest gener-
alizable ﬁndings, as the other plant communities including
Medicago sativa had different plant composition and cover
rates, and didn’t conﬁrm these assumptions (Table S1).
Moreover, the correlation between MWD and RLD wasn’t
signiﬁcant in the SC dataset (see Fig. S2).

4.3.
Role of the botanical family of sown species in
soil stabilization in vineyards
Although this study was not designed to compare the
effect of species on MWD, we could analyze the quadrats
in terms of dominant botanical families, as inﬂuenced by
the sown service crop species (Fig. 2). The impact of the
root functional markers of the botanical families on soil
stabilization may have been twofold, with one related to
the speciﬁc effects of roots and the other to the develop-
ment of species, with poor development probably leading
to a weak impact of the species on soil stabilization.
The PCA conducted in all quadrats highlighted some
avenues for discussing the impacts of the sown botanical
family, and suggested some trends. First axis conﬁrmed
previous ﬁndings on the existence of a root economics
spectrum opposing species and plant communities by their
root diameter and speciﬁc root length (Prieto et al., 2015;
Roumet et al., 2016). Here, high diameter was mainly ex-
hibited by Fabaceae species and to a lesser extent Plantag-
inaceae and Asteraceae (Fig. 2, Table S2), while high SRL
and very ﬁne root fraction was exhibited by Poaceae and
Hydrophyllaceae species. The high proportion of very ﬁne
roots may physically limit the formation of macroaggre-
gates, resulting in lower MWD with graminoids (Jastrow
et al., 1998; Poirier et al., 2017). In addition, Roumet et al.
(2016) showed that eudicot species had thicker ﬁne roots,
and a higher concentration of water-soluble compounds
than graminoids, and a recent study showed that root
soluble compound concentration was the best predictor of
MWD among several root traits (Poirier et al., 2017). MWD
was negatively related to axis 1 so as Fabaceae coordinates:
although we didn’t measure root chemical compounds, we
hypothesize here that the inﬂuence of Fabaceae on MWD
is related to root soluble compound composition, and in a
further extent to root exudation (Bardgett et al., 2014).
However, contrary results were reported in other studies
Pérès et al. (2013); Gould et al. (2016) found that soil
aggregate stability increased with grasses, and decreased
with legumes. In their experiment, although unfertilized,
plant communities were sown 4 years before their soil
stability measurements, following 40 years of vegetable
and wheat cultivation. We hypothesize that their plant
communities beneﬁted from better soil conditions than in
the present study (e.g. higher soil organic matter contents,
i.e. 2–3% SOC), and the higher root biomass they found
in the presence of grasses compared to legumes supports
this hypothesis. Gould et al. (2016) also found lower root
length densities under legume cover than under grasses,
which may have limited the impact of legumes on the soil
aggregate stability. Their experiment was set up in spring
2002 and their aggregate stability measurements were
done in summer 2012; here again we hypothesize that the
plant communities beneﬁted from better soil conditions
than plants in the present study, thus favoring graminoid
development compared to the vineyard soil. These results
raise the question as to what species would be the most
efﬁcient to increase soil aggregate stability in soils with
low SOC content, such as the soils from our experimental
vineyard. Indeed, symbiotic N ﬁxation that occurs with
Fabaceae may allow such species to grow in less favorable
conditions than graminoids, and consequently produce
more root biomass, and in ﬁne increase the soil aggregate
stability more efﬁciently than graminoids would in such
conditions (Table S1).
4.4.
Study limitations
First of all, the time scale of this study probably explain
the low predictive potential of root functional markers
to explain aggregate stability. Indeed, service crops and
spontaneous vegetation had a 6 months growth only, while
in other studies MWD are often measured several years
after plant community establishment (Pérès et al., 2013;
Gould et al., 2016; Poirier et al., 2017). In this study, the
inﬂuence of root functional markers strongly depended on
plant growth, which was lower under poor soil conditions
(Table 2). Moreover, the sowings of service crops were not
balanced across soil management strategies, which makes
difﬁcult to discriminate the effects of soil properties vs.
root functional markers (Table S1). The measurements of
soil organic properties were not made at each quadrat but
with composites, and the precision of SOC values may
have hindered the inﬂuence of root functional markers
in some situations. We couldn’t measure soil aggregate
stability at the beginning of the experiment, which compli-
cates the interpretation of differences observed a posteriori.
However, plant communities were compared to bare soil
quadrats to assess for root system effect on MWD. Finally,
the measurement of only one indicator of soil aggregate
stability, the mean weight diameter (MWD), didn’t allow
us to study the relations between root functional markers
and particular classes of aggregate sizes (Poirier et al.,
2017).
The efﬁciency of certain botanical families and their root
functional markers in improving soil aggregate stability on
a short-term in agrosystems would need further research.
In heterogeneous agricultural ﬁelds, a ﬁne characterization
of initial soil conditions would probably reﬁne results of
statistical relations between plant functional markers, soil
organic properties and aggregate stability. As plant traits
respond to environmental factors, it is important to study
the relations between plant traits and services in various
soil conditions to reﬂect the diversity of ﬁeld situations
and cropping systems. Balanced experiments including
various species and botanical families are needed to ﬁnd
ideotypes of service crops on the basis of plant traits, and
expand the pool of species of interest to provide services

Conclusion
In this study, we did not conﬁrm the hypothesis that
root functional markers would have a higher contribution
than soil properties to explain aggregate stability in soils
with low soil organic carbon content; SOC had higher
potential than root functional markers to predict aggre-
gate stability overall and in situations with the lowest soil
organic carbon contents. However we highlighted some
positive relations between root functional markers and
soil aggregate stability that encourages research efforts
for the study of plant traits and ecosystem services in
agriculture. Soil aggregate stability in cropped soils re-
sults from complex interactions between soil management
strategies, soil properties and plant functional markers,
and this study highlighted that service crop communi-
ties have an impact on soil stabilization even after a short
growth period. Within herbaceous species, we showed
that the root mean diameter is an important functional
marker to explain soil aggregate stability as it is linked to
the root water-soluble concentration and exudation, which
have a marked impact on the soil aggregate stability. We
also suggest that Fabaceae species may be more efﬁcient
than Poaceae species in increasing soil aggregate stability
on a short time scale under low SOC contents. Moreover
we underlined the predominant role of the past manage-
ment strategy in soil stabilization, which directly drives
soil organic carbon and the rooting efﬁciency of service
crops. Functional approach is a powerful tool for gaining
insight into how plants inﬂuence ecosystems and how they
respond to environmental factors on a broad scale, and it
enables comparison of studies and general application of
the ﬁndings across a wide range of environments. Plant
functioning patterns could be identiﬁed on the basis of
plant traits, and plant traits may thus reveal ideotypes of
service crops and expand the pool of species of interest to
provide services in agriculture.

Abstract
Background and aims Plant species can have a major
effect on erosion dynamics and soil losses by
retaining sediment transported during concentrated
runoff. Identifying plant functional traits that influ-
ence and predict a species ability for sediment
trapping is therefore of great interest, especially to
improve management and restoration of degraded
lands.
Methods Sediment trapping ability of four morpho-
logically contrasted species, the broadleaf species
Buxus sempervirens and Lavandula angustifolia, and
the coniferous species Juniperus communis and Pinus
nigra, were investigated with flume experiments. Six
functional traits describing stem, leaf and the overall
plant morphology, were measured on seedlings.
Analyses were performed to compare species effi-
ciency in sediment trapping and to identify traits
related to the amount of sediment trapped.
Results Sediment trapping (RTS) was the highest
upslope of Lavandula and the lowest upslope of
Juniperus. Principal component analysis showed that
RTS was best correlated (positively) with canopy
density, described by plant biomass and leaf area per
unit volume of plant. Leaf area and plant roundness
were also positively related to RTS but to a lesser
extent.
Conclusions The results of this experimental study
suggest that canopy completeness, leaf morphology
and plant shape influence sediment retention by
plants. Such knowledge may improve the diagnosis
of land vulnerability to erosion and the prediction of
ecosystem functioning after ecological restoration by
the construction of bioengineering works in gully
floors.

Introduction
Soil erosion and soil loss are natural processes that
have been intensified with human land use, and rank
as main environmental issues in many cultivated and
natural lands (Morgan 1995; Pimentel et al. 1995;

Pimentel and Kounang 1998). Erosion control and
sediment retention have been listed among the 17
major ecosystem services contributing to human
welfare and development (Costanza et al. 1997; de
Groots et al. 2002), but also belong to those services
that have degraded during the last sixty years,
threatening people economical and physical safety
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
In Southern Alps in France, gully erosion on very
erodible marly soils has led to the formation of
extensive degraded areas called badlands (Oostwoud
Wijdenes and Ergenzinger 1998; Poesen et al. 2003),
in which high rates of soil loss have been observed
(Mathys et al. 2003). Therefore, these eroded lands,
which are now subjected to rigorous management,
often need ecological restoration (Rey 2009). In
recent years, ecological engineering solutions have
developed and promote the use of vegetation to
protect soils and prevent water erosion (Norris et al.
2008; Stokes et al. 2010).
Indeed, vegetation has many effects on erosion
control and soil stability (Thornes 1990), that can be
divided into two main categories: active and passive
protection. On the one hand, active protection
encompasses all the processes, hydrological as well
as mechanical, that affect soil erodibility and reduce
erosion rates. Plant canopy reduces surface runoff and
erosion rates by intercepting rainfall, and by increas-
ing water infiltration and surface roughness (Styzcen
and Morgan 1995). Plant roots lower pore water
pressure, increase soil aggregate stability and provide
additional soil cohesion through root reinforcement
(Gyssels et al. 2005). On the other hand, passive
protection processes do not prevent erosion from
occurring but reduce soil loss at a larger scale (i.e.
slope) by locally enhancing sediment deposition
(Descheemaeker et al. 2006) upslope of plants and
forming phytogenic mounds that act as filtering
barriers (Bergkamp 1998; Sanchez and Puigdefábregas
1994). These vegetative filters have been extensively
studied for their role in reducing water pollution with
sediment and nutrient near croplands (Magette et al.
1989; Robinson et al. 1996; Abu-Zreig et al. 2004)
and riparian areas (Daniels and Gilliam 1993; Lee et
al. 2000; Hook 2003).
The use of plant functional traits to relate plant
species to their environment and to predict species
effect on ecosystem functioning has received a
growing interest over recent years (Lavorel and
Garnier 2002; Lavorel et al. 2007). Recent conceptual
advances suggest that functional effect traits play a
major role in ecosystem processes (Chapin et al.
2000; Lavorel and Garnier 2002), and several authors
highlight the need to identify plant traits that
contribute to the provision of ecological services
when focusing on ecological restoration of ecosys-
tems (Díaz et al. 2006; Luck et al. 2009). Many
studies have been carried out to better understand the
role of plant traits in biogeochemical cycles (e.g.
Cornelissen et al. 1999; Craine et al. 2002; Cornwell
et al. 2008; De Deyn et al. 2008), response to fire
(Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Pausas et al. 2004) or
grazing (Saatkamp et al. 2010), but little is known
about the effect of plant traits on erosion dynamics.
Despite the well-known potential effect plants can
have on erosion processes in the ecosystem, to date,
few studies have focused interest on plant morpho-
logical traits influencing sediment trapping. In the
case of grass filter strips, filter length and width
appeared as important features for sediment retention
(Van Dijk et al. 1996; Lee et al. 2000; Abu-Zreig et al.
2004). At the scale of the individual plant species,
Bochet et al. (2000) found that canopy density (i.e.
number of stems) of shrubs and grasses from semi-
arid environments influenced the height of phytogenic
mounds. Isselin-Nondedeu and Bédécarrats (2007)
also showed that sediment trapping was positively
correlated with canopy density but negatively with
plant roundness index (plant width to length ratio) of
alpine species from mountain ecosystems. Therefore,
comparing and predicting species efficiency for
sediment trapping using plant traits requires expand-
ing our data base. In particular, to our knowledge, leaf
morphology has never been considered in experimen-
tal studies on the relationship between plant traits and
sediment trapping.
In this study, our objectives were (1) to investigate
the ability for sediment trapping of woody species
typical of marly eroded lands and (2) to identify
functional traits that best explain this ability. Sediment
trapping was evaluated at the plant scale during flume
experiments carried out on four nursery-grown spe-
cies prevalent in eroded marly ecosystems of the
French Southern Alps. We used one-year old individ-
uals to study soil retention processes at the early
stages of natural vegetation colonization, when
vegetation cover is still low and mainly composed
of seedlings, but when its role in erosion control
136

processes is already crucial. This represents one of the
first attempts, to our knowledge, to analyse vegetation
ability to trap sediments at the plant scale in
laboratory conditions. Six traits related to plant, leaf
and stem morphology, and selected for their alleged
influence on sediment trapping, were examined.
Analyses were performed to compare species ability
to trap sediments and to identify functional traits
involved in sediment retention, for a future use of
species which will have maximal sediment trapping
effects in bioengineering works.
Materials and methods
Plant material
For this study, four species growing spontaneously
in eroded marly lands of the French Southern Alps
were
chosen:
two
broadleaf
species,
Buxus
sempervirens and Lavandula angustifolia (hereafter
Buxus and Lavandula), and two conifers, Pinus nigra
austriaca, used in the past for soil stabilization
(Vallauri et al. 2002), and Juniperus communis
(hereafter Pinus and Juniperus). One-year old indi-
viduals of each species were obtained from a nursery.
These four species presented different above-ground
morphology. The two conifers have thin needles
(approximately 0.1 cm large) but Juniperus’ ones
are shorter than Pinus’ ones (1 and 2–5 cm, respec-
tively, on average). On the other hand, the broadleaf
species present different leaf morphologies, Buxus
having oval leaves and Lavandula having rather linear
leaves (approximately 1.5×0.5 cm and 2×0.3 cm,
respectively). As a result of their growth in a nursery
under non limiting conditions, seedlings height
ranged from 9.1 cm for Buxus to 48.9 cm for
Juniperus (Table 1), and seedlings diameter was
about 7 cm for Lavandula and about 15 cm for other
species.

Hydraulic flume experiment
Prior to the flume experiments, plants were placed in
16 cm square plastic pots using a polystyrene
template to ensure they were positioned correctly in
the pot (Fig. 1). A thin layer of fast-setting cement
was then applied on the whole soil surface to the
upper rim of the pot. This was done to homogenise
the soil surface between samples in order to exclude a
possible detachment of soil particles during the tests
and to restrict the observations to the sediment
trapping of above-ground parts of plants only.
Before each test, pots were placed in an opening
box at the bottom of a 5 m-long plexiglass flume
(Fig. 1), similar to the one used by Poesen et al.
(1999) but modified and adapted to the present
objectives. Adhesive tape was stuck straddling the
rims of the pot and the bottom of the flume to prevent
edge effects. Marly sediment collected in the field
(Draix experimental site, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence,
France, 44°08′N, 6°20′E) was sieved (1 cm mesh) and
dried to ensure similar granulometry and moisture
during the tests. One litre of marly sediment was
regularly spread over a 50 cm distance, two meters
upslope of the plant sample (Fig. 1). Twenty samples
per species (single plant one at a time) were then
exposed to concentrated flow at a constant discharge
(Q) of 0.0005 m3.s−1 during 60 s. During the tests, all
the sediments were progressively carried along with
the flow and filtered by the plant (Fig. 2).
Sediment trapping
After the tests, sediment trapped by the plant was
collected on the cement layer, oven-dried (48 h at 72°C)
and weighed. Plant width (perpendicular to the flow)
and length (direction of the flow), both at 1 cm height
(maximum flow height observed), were measured to
calculate interception volume (Table 1). Relative
trapped sediment (RTS, g.cm−3) was calculated as
the mass of sediment trapped per unit volume. Plants
were then harvested for trait measurements.
Trait measurements
After each test, a set of plant traits, a priori directly or
indirectly related to sediment trapping were measured.
A plant roundness index was calculated as the ratio of
width to length to investigate the effect of plant shape.
Roundness index values of 1 indicate circular shapes,
values greater than 1 indicate plants larger in width
than in length and vice versa for values below 1.
Mean leaf area was estimated on five to ten fresh
leaves per plant at a time. To evaluate plant roughness
towards concentrated flow, we calculated leaf area per
unit volume by dividing leaf area (mean leaf area x
leaf number in the interception volume) by the
interception volume. Mean leaf dry matter content
(LDMC, mg.g−1) was determined for each plant,
using the same leaf samples as for mean leaf area
estimation. LDMC was calculated by dividing leaf
oven-dry mass (48 h at 72°C) by leaf fresh mass.
Stem specific density (SSD, mg.mm−3) was calculated
as the ratio of the oven-dry mass of a section of the
plant’s stem to its volume, measured manually with a
calliper when still fresh. LDMC and SSD were used
as estimations of plant resistance to mechanical

constraints related to concentrated flow (Cornelissen
et al. 2003). Total plant dry mass was then weighed
and normalized by canopy volume (as it is plant-size
dependent) to obtain dry mass per unit volume and
allow biomass comparisons between species.
Data analysis
A comparative approach was first used with analysis of
variance (ANOVA) to determine differences in plant
morphology between species and to examine differ-
ences in species ability for sediment trapping (Tukey’s
HSD test). Before analysis, all data were tested for
normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and corrected when
needed either with logarithmic or square-root trans-
formations. To determine how functional traits and RTS
were related across species, principal components
analysis (PCA) was performed on untransformed data.
Analyses were carried out with STATISTICA
(version 8.0 for Windows Statsoft 1984).
Results
Species efficiency in sediment trapping
Sediment deposition was observed upslope and within
the canopy of each sample, with sediment mass
ranging from 12 to 230 g. The raw mass of sediment
trapped ranged from 0.8% to 15% of marly sediment
transported during the tests. When normalised by
interception volume, results show significant RTS
differences between species (Fig. 3). Broadleaf
species Lavandula and Buxus trapped the highest
amount of sediment per unit volume ahead of the
conifers Pinus and Juniperus (ANOVA: F=10.6, p<
0.001). Lavandula and Buxus trapped respectively 3.7
and 2.8 times more sediment than Juniperus, and 1.9
and 1.5 times more sediment than Pinus.
Trait differences between species
All traits except plant roundness index showed large
variation among species (Table 2). Buxus had the
largest leaves and Juniperus the smallest ones,
representing significant differences in leaf shapes.
LDMC differences indicate that Buxus and Pinus had
the tenderest leaves, as indicated by low values, while
on the other hand, Lavandula and Juniperus, with
high LDMC, had tougher ones. Similarly, Buxus had
the highest SSD values ahead of Lavandula, Junipe-
rus and Pinus. Finally, canopy density, described by
plant dry mass and leaf area per unit volume, also
differed significantly among species, Lavandula hav-
ing the highest biomass density (dry mass per unit
volume). For leaf area per unit volume, results
showed that Buxus and Lavandula had significantly

higher leaf area density near the soil surface than
Pinus and Juniperus.
Relationship between sediment trapping
and functional traits
PCA results indicate that principal component axes
one, two and three explained 30.9, 23.5 and 18.3% of
the variation in the database respectively. Axis one
differentiated species according to leaf area per unit of
interception volume and mean leaf area (Fig. 4a and
b). Lavandula and Buxus, which had respectively
high canopy density and large leaves, occupied the
upper end of axis one, whereas Pinus and Juniperus
had opposite morphologies. Axis two and three were
mostly defined respectively by LDMC and SSD, and
by biomass per unit volume and plant roundness.
Sediment trapping ability (RTS) contributed mainly to
axes one and three. Pearson’s correlations (Table 3)
showed that RTS was significantly positively corre-
lated with four morphological traits. Strongest corre-
lations appeared with leaf area per unit volume and
biomass per unit volume. Mean leaf area and plant
roundness were also correlated with RTS but correla-
tion coefficients were lower. Pairwise correlation
coefficient showed that several traits were significantly
related. Most obviously, LDMC and SSD, describing
tissue density were also positively correlated.
Discussion
The formation of phytogenic mounds under isolated
plants has been described in many degraded ecosys-
tems (Sanchez and Puigdefabregas 1994; Bergkamp
1998; Bochet et al. 2000; El-Bana et al. 2003; Isselin-
Nondedeu and Bédécarrats 2007), but we know little
about functional traits influencing mound size and
shape at the plant scale. The results of the present
study showed that all individuals tested retained
sediment during concentrated flow, but there were
important differences between species effectiveness as
found in previous studies (Bochet et al. 2000; Isselin-
Nondedeu and Bédécarrats 2007). Lavandula and
Juniperus were found the most and least effective
species respectively, and higher RTS were obtained
upslope of the two broadleaf species. The raw mass of
sediment trapped was much lower than sediment
discharge reductions observed in previous laboratory
experiments (e.g. up to 90% of coarse particles in
Meyer et al. 1995; from 50 to 99% in Van Dijk et al.
1996). Differences in experimental settings, like plant
filter size, experiment duration, flume slope, soil type
or the way water was loaded with sediment, may
explain these differences. Moreover, by recovering
the soil of the samples by a thin layer of cement, we
may reduce surface roughness and thus sediment
deposition rates.

This study focused on raw mass of sediment
without distinguishing particle size and mound com-
position (i.e. silt and clay content). Soil erosion and
sediment deposition are processes strongly related to
particle size, fine clay particles being preferentially
detached from source area and coarse particles being
the first to deposit. Meyer et al. (1995) have shown
that sediment retention decreased as particle size
decreased, most of the sediment trapped being coarser
than 125 μm. Therefore, particle size distribution in
the sediment deposited upslope of plants could be an
important parameter to consider.
Differences in RTS between species suggest that
leaf and whole plant morphologies are important
determinants of sediment retention ability. Multivar-
iate analysis showed that species ability for sediment
retention was significantly related to several plant
features. The strongest relationship was found with
canopy density, defined either by plant biomass or
leaf area per unit volume. The more the vegetation
foliage is dense, the more sediment is trapped. This
conclusion is consistent with previous investigations
which highlighted that canopy density and complete-
ness determined sediment trapping ability (Van Dijk
et al. 1996; Bochet et al. 2000; Isselin-Nondedeu and
Bédécarrats 2007).
Leaf area also played an important role in sediment
retention, larger leaves providing larger interception
area and thus increasing sediment trapping ability. No
significant correlation was found between RTS and
LDMC or SSD. These two traits describe tissue
density and are often used as surrogates for resistance
to physical hazards and abiotic factors (Cornelissen et
al. 2003). Yet, during the tests, we observed that the
stems of Juniperus bended under concentrated flow.
This suggests that stem resistance to bending could
affect species effectiveness in sediment trapping and it
could be an additional reason to explain the low RTS
values this species presented. Measurements of
species biomechanical properties directly related to
plant resistance to external constraints, such as leaf
tensile strength (e.g. Díaz et al. 2001), stem bending
resistance (e.g. Goodman and Ennos 1997), lignin and
cellulose content (Genet et al. 2005) or resistance to
uprooting by concentrated flow (e.g. Burylo et al.
2009) should be included in future experiments.
Plant shape also affected sediment trapping ability.
High roundness indices, which define plants wider
than long, were associated with higher mass of
trapped sediment. This result is consistent with
previous investigations which highlighted the effi-
ciency in sediment retention of plants growing
perpendicular to the slope and forming a barrier to
the flow (Valentin et al. 1999; Bochet et al. 2000;
Abu-Zreig et al. 2004), even if Isselin-Nondedeu and
Bédécarrats (2007) found inverse relationship be-
tween sediment trapping ability and plant shape.
The results provided by this study are new
quantitative elements for the understanding and
evaluation of species ability for sediment retention
in degraded lands. They were obtained from hydraulic
flume tests to reduce and simplify the influence of the
numerous environmental variables in the field and to
make the observations comparable and reproducible.
These simulations can be discussed for their artifici-
ality and the lack of connection with the field.
Nevertheless, despite the simplifications made here,
the experimental design proved to be useful for
determining the relationships between species ability
to trap sediments and their functional traits.

Although the influence of vegetation on sediment
deposition and erosion control is well-known (Styzcen
and Morgan 1995), few studies have attempted to
investigate the way form is related to function. To
date, this study is the first to explicitly examine in
laboratory conditions the effect on sediment retention
of functional traits describing leaf, stem and the whole
plant morphology. In future investigations, the exper-
iment could however be improved and extended by
using various slopes angles and flow discharges, and
a larger selection of species and functional traits.
Further experiment should include plant biomechan-
ical properties, such as leaf tensile strength, stem
bending resistance or stem lignin and cellulose
content, which would better describe stem and leaf
toughness. Species set, soil types and the range of
experimental parameters tested (i.e. slope angle and
flow discharge) should also be expanded.
Current methodologies to determine land vulnera-
bility to erosion are based on local topography and on
the percentage of vegetation cover (Rey 2009). Plant
functional traits, which appear as relevant parameters
to predict species performance for sediment trapping,
could be used to add a functional component into
such tools and to improve diagnosis. Management of
eroded lands could also be improved by considering
plant morphological features, such as canopy density
and leaf area, when selecting woody species in
ecological restoration projects. In addition, plant
functions are manifold and plants have indirect effects
on ecosystems, often observed in the long term during
the restoration process. For example, plants improve
the soil hydrological, chemical and physical proper-
ties (Cerdà 1998; Bochet et al. 1999). Sediment
retention by plants creates mounds which facilitate
seedlings establishment and survival of other species
(Burylo et al. 2007). Selecting species according to
their ability to trap sediment could thus also help
enhance vegetation establishment and community
diversity.
Conclusion
A functional approach was used to study species
ability for sediment trapping at the early stages of
plant development. The results showed that canopy
density, leaf size and plant shape appear as relevant
traits to evaluate and predict species efficiency for
sediment trapping. Despite some limitations, this
study provided promising results which could have
practical implications for ecological restoration of
eroded lands and may improve management tools.
Plant species provide a variety of ecological func-
tions, such as soil reinforcement or improvement of
the soil hydrological, chemical and physical proper-
ties, which are as essential as sediment trapping and
which must be kept in mind for sustainable restoration
of eroded lands.

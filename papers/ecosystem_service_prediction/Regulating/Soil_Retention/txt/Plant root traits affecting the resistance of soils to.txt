ABSTRACT:
The effect of plant species on erosion processes may be decisive for long-term soil protection in degraded ecosystems. The
identification of functional effect traits that predict species ability for erosion control would be of great interest for ecological restoration
purposes. Flume experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the root systems of three species having contrasted ecological
requirements from eroded marly lands of the French Southern Alps [i.e. Robinia pseudo acacia (tree), Pinus nigra austriaca (tree) and
Achnatherum calamagrostis (grass)], on concentrated flow erosion rates. Ten functional traits, describing plant morphological and biome-
chanical features, were measured on each tested sample. Analyses were performed to identify traits that determine plant root effects on
erosion control. Erosion rates were lowest for samples of Robinia pseudo acacia, intermediate in Achnatherum calamagrostis and highest
in Pinus nigra austriaca. The three species also differed strongly in their traits. Principal components analysis showed that the erosion-
reducing potential of plant species was negatively correlated to root diameter and positively correlated to the percentage of fine roots.
The results highlighted the role of small flexible roots in root reinforcement processes, and suggested the importance of high root surface
and higher tensile strength for soil stabilization. By combining flume experiment to plant functional traits measurements, we identified
root system features influencing plant species performance for soil protection against concentrated flow erosion. Plant functional traits
related to species efficiency for erosion control represent useful tools to improve the diagnosis of land vulnerability to erosion, plant
community resistance and the prediction of ecosystem functioning after ecological restoration. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Introduction
During the past 15 years, researchers from various disciplinary
fields have addressed the importance of ecosystems services
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005), defined as the
benefits human populations derive from ecosystem processes
(Costanza et al., 1997), to human societies. Soil retention and
erosion control are part of the regulation functions provided
by vegetation (De Groots et al., 2002) historically recognized
since the nineteenth century and have become critically
important in many ecosystems (Pimentel and Kounang, 1998).
Indeed, the loss of soil through water erosion is one of the
greatest environmental issues affecting both agricultural and
natural lands worldwide (Morgan, 1995; Pimentel et al., 1995;
Durán and Rodríguez, 2008). In the French Southern Alps, marly
lands are subjected to severe water erosion and intense gullying
(Figure 1), ending in the formation of badlands (Poesen et al.,
2003), where concentrated runoff and shallow soil slippage
processes cause considerable soil losses (35 cm yr–1 in Lecompte
et al., 1998; 100 tons ha–1 yr–1 in Mathys et al., 2003).
Vegetation has long been recognized as a factor significantly
influencing erosion rates on slopes prone to instability (Thornes,
1990; Morgan, 1995) and has thus been used for decades in eco-
logical restoration operations on degraded lands (e.g. Coutancier,
2004; Norris et al., 2008; Stokes et al., 2010). The effects of
vegetation on concentrated flow erosion are manifold. Plant
canopy intercepts rainfall, increases water infiltration and surface
roughness (Styzcen and Morgan, 1995), thus reducing surface
runoff and concentrated flow erosion. This protective effect of
vegetation has mostly been related to vegetation cover without
taking into account community composition and functional
diversity (Garnier et al., 2004). Yet, species with certain functional
traits may be more efficient in soil stabilization than others and
may have a stronger impact on erosive dynamics and ecosystem
stability (De Baets et al., 2009; Stokes et al., 2009). Evidence has
shown that ecosystem processes are strongly influenced by the
functional
traits
of
individual
species
that
compose
the
community (Díaz and Cabido, 2001; Garnier et al., 2004;
Mokany et al., 2008). Classifying species according to their
impact on ecosystem processes and predicting ecosystem func-
tioning from these so-called ‘functional effect traits’ that have a
significant influence on ecosystems processes, is therefore a
major challenge in applied ecology (Lavorel and Garnier,
2002). This approach has been used to determine plant traits that
control litter decomposition rates (e.g. Cortez et al., 2007;
Cornwell et al., 2008), primary productivity (e.g. Pontes et al.,
2007) or nitrogen cycling (e.g. Craine et al., 2002) but can
be generalized to other ecological processes including soil

protection against concentrated flow erosion. In degraded areas
in a context of ecosystem restoration, several authors have
stressed the need to identify species and plant traits that
contribute to the provision of ecosystem services (Díaz et al.,
2006; Luck et al., 2009). In addition, it is becoming widely
acknowledged that interdisciplinary studies, relating ecology
and geomorphology are necessary (Osterkamp et al., 2012;
Stoffel and Wilford, 2012).
Often neglected in soil erosion models, plant roots also have a
number of hydrological and mechanical effects (Gyssels et al.,
2005). The effect of plant root systems on soil stability has
received increasing attention in recent years. Small flexible roots
lower pore water pressure, increase surface roughness and
provide additional soil cohesion through root reinforcement
(Reubens et al., 2007). Concentrated flow erosion rates have
been related to root traits such as root density (i.e. root mass per
unit volume of soil – Li et al., 1991; De Baets et al., 2006; Gyssels
et al., 2006), root length density (i.e. root length per unit volume
of soil – Mamo and Bubenzer, 2001; De Baets et al., 2006; De
Baets et al., 2007), root system type (heart versus tap root system
– De Baets et al., 2007) and root surface area density (i.e. root
surface per unit volume of soil – Zhou and Shangguan, 2005).
Li et al. (1991) also reported that root reinforcement of soils
depends on the number of fibrous roots less than 1 mm in
diameter, the most resistant to tension (Gray and Sotir, 1996).
Although the literature on the effects of plant roots on soil
erosion by runoff is well documented, information remains
rather
descriptive.
Quantitative
research
and
laboratory
experiments on hydraulic flume remains sparse (Mamo and
Bubenzer, 2001; De Baets et al., 2006), primarily because of
methodological difficulties. Moreover, experimental studies
have been carried out on different species, traits and soil condi-
tions, and different relationships between plant traits and
erosion rates have been obtained. So far, generalizing on the
functional traits that can explain or predict the effect of plant
species on soil stability against concentrated flow is not achiev-
able. Previous studies related erosion rates to ad hoc chosen or
easy to measure root variables, whereas this study measured a
complete set of root variables potentially influencing soil
erosion rates and investigated their correlation with erosion-
reducing potential of plant root systems, in order to present
the root variables that relate best to the erosion-reducing poten-
tial of plant root systems in early growth stages.
The present study, focusing on the erosion processes in the
marly badlands of the French Southern Alps, aims to expand
our knowledge on plant functional traits that are involved in root
reinforcement of soils and in reducing concentrated flow erosion
rates. To meet this objective, we conducted flume experiments to
simulate concentrated runoff similar to the ones that can be
observed in gully beds during intense rainfalls. Tests were carried
out on soil samples with laboratory grown plant species to evalu-
ate the influence of the root system of three different species on
soil resistance to incision by concentrated flow erosion. Soil
detachment rates were assessed and 10 plant traits related to root
biomass, root morphology and root mechanical properties were
measured. Results are discussed in order to identify the relevant
traits to evaluate and predict species performance for soil
reinforcement against concentrate flow erosion.
Materials and Methods
Plant material
Three species were selected according to the following criteria:
they are pioneer species prevalent in eroded marly lands, they
include different root system types to have different root traits
values, they are, or were, used for land restoration. Added to
availability constraints in the field or in nurseries and to exper-
imental constraints, three species were studied: two tree
species, Pinus nigra austriaca and Robinia pseudo acacia and
the grass Achnatherum calamagrostis. The two tree species
are both exotic species native to Austria and North America
respectively but they did not show invasive development in
marly lands of the French Southern Alps since they were first
introduced during restoration operations at the end of the
nineteenth century (Vallauri et al., 2002).
In April 2009, seeds of the two tree species were germinated in
vermiculite, a chemically inert mineral substrate, for four weeks
in a growth chamber at 25 C /15 C day/night temperature and
70% relative humidity. For the grass species, individual tussocks
were collected in the field in autumn and cultivated in common
garden during winter. Ramets were then isolated in April 2009,
cut to 3 cm and 5 cm for aerial parts and roots respectively, and
planted in vermiculite.
Four weeks after germination and multiplication, seedlings,
similar in size and shape, were transplanted into plastic pots
(16 cm square  23 cm deep) filled with marly substrate
collected from the field (Draix experimental site, Alpes de
Haute Provence department, France, 44 8’N, 6 20’E). At the

same time, bare soil pots were prepared to serve as control. The
soil from this site corresponded to the detrital and regolith
layers that deposited after removal by erosion processes and
was made of structureless marl fragments and colluvial
materials. These marls have relatively low carbonate content
(from 20 to 35%) their effective cohesion ranges from 6 to 12 kPa
(Antoine et al., 1995; Maquaire et al., 2003).
Pots were planted with 10 seedlings regularly distributed and
then randomly placed in the experimental garden, with a 20 cm
distance, where plants were let to grow. Root growth and root
density were checked weekly by excavating soil samples from
additional pots and flume experiment took place eight weeks
later (July 2009) when root density was assumed sufficient to
have a significant effect on soil stability
Hydraulic flume experiment
Flume experiments were conducted in July 2009, on three
month old seedlings. Before each test, soil samples were
prepared as follows: the above-ground biomass was removed
(clipped level at the soil surface) and samples were placed in
a container filled with water to wet the entire soil column and
ensure similar soil moisture content between the samples. After
soaking, samples were left to drain for 12 hours.
Before the experiment, the bottom of the pots was cut and
thin plates of polystyrene were added to raise the soil surface
at the upper rim of the pot. Pots were placed in an open box
at the bottom of the flume (Figure 2) and adhesive tape was
stuck straddling the rims of the pot and the bottom of the flume
to prevent edge effects. Samples were then exposed to a
concentrated flow at a constant discharge (Q) of 00015 m3 s–
1 during 60 seconds. This duration was determined after
preliminary tests had shown that soil detachment mainly
occurred during the first 60 seconds of the experiment. The
corresponding flow shear stress (t), which was used to evaluate
the erosive force of the concentrated flow (Gimenez and
Govers, 2002; De Baets et al., 2006), was 52 Pa (see Appendix
for details), which falls within the range of values needed for
incipient motion of soil particles (18–106 Pa, Poesen et al.,
2003). Detached soil particles were collected at the bottom
end of the flume in two 50 L buckets every 30 seconds to calcu-
late erosion rates. Tests were repeated on 10 pots per species.
Ten tests were also carried out on bare soil samples (control).
Soil detachment rate
After the flume experiments, the collected sediments were left
to decant, and then separated from the water, dried (48 hours
at 70 C) and weighed. Relative soil detachment (RSD) rate
was calculated for each test as the ratio of the mass of sediment
detached from root-permeated samples to the average mass of
sediment detached from bare soil samples (control).
Morphological traits measurement
The above-ground parts of plants, cut before the flume experi-
ments, were dried (48 hours at 70 C) and weighed. After the
tests, samples were cleaned by gently removing the soil by
hand with a water jet, and conserved in ethanol 50% (v/v) until
analysis. Root traits were measured using WinRHIZO PRO
(version 2003b, Regent Instrument, Quebec, Canada) following
the protocol described in Bouma et al. (2000). The roots were
stained with blue methylene (5 g L–1) in order to increase
contrast and then scanned at a resolution of 400 dpi. WinRHIZO
was then used to determine root mean diameter (D), root length
(L), external root surface (RSA), volume (V) and the percentage
of fine roots with a diameter less than 0.5 mm (FR). Roots were
then dried for 48 hours at 70 C and weighed.
Root density (root mass per unit volume of root-permeated
soil, RD in kg m–3), root tissue density (RTD in g cm–3), specific
root length (SRL in m g–1) and root length density (root length
per unit volume of root-permeated soil, RLD in km m–3) were
calculated. Finally, root to shoot ratio (R/S) was obtained by
dividing dry root mass by dry shoot mass.

PLANT ROOT TRAITS AND SOIL STABILITY

Root tensile strength
Root samples were collected on another set of pots not used in
the flume experiments. Roots were cleaned and undamaged
root fragments were selected for tensile tests on a tensile-
strength meter built on the basis of Hendry and Grime (1993).
Before testing, root diameter was measured at three points
along the root length. Once the root had broken, root tensile
strength TR (in MPa) was calculated as the peak force
(N) needed to break the root per unit of cross-sectional area
(in mm2). For each species, at least 30 tests were performed
on roots with diameters ranging from 006 to 088 mm.
Data analysis
Variations in soil detachment rates and trait values between
species were investigated using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Root tensile strength values were analysed through
analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with root diameter as a
covariate. The assumption of normality was verified prior to
analysis (Shapiro–Wilk’s test) and significant differences were
assessed with Tukey’s HSD test.
Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to relate
plant traits to erosion rates. All measured traits, except TR which
was not calculated on the same samples, were included
untransformed in the analyses.
Analyses were carried out with STATISTICA (version 8.0 for
Windows, Statsoft, 2008).
Results
Soil detachment rates
Erosion occurred in all soil samples but the presence of roots
greatly reduced erosion rates (Figure 3). However, there were
large differences in RSD rates between the three species studied
and through time. Robinia pseudo acacia showed the strongest
effect and reduced soil detachment by more than 95% since
the first 30 seconds (no sediment was collected in the last 30
seconds of the test) compared with control. The grass species,
Achnatherum calamagrostis, and the tree species Pinus nigra,
also substantially stabilized the soil but to a lesser extent. RSD
rates decreased with time for Achnatherum calamagrostis but
stayed constant for Pinus nigra.
Plant traits and root tensile strength
All traits measured were significantly different between species
except root volume (Table I), traducing important morphological
differences in species root systems. Achnatherum calamagrostis
had the more developed root system (RD, RLD and RSA) and
presented the roots with highest tissue density (RTD), before
Robinia pseudo acacia and Pinus nigra austriaca. However,
Robinia pseudo acacia had finer roots [D, SRL and percentage
of fine roots (%FR)] than Achnatherum calamagrostis and Pinus
nigra austriaca, the later one having the thickest and shorter roots.
Root biomechanical properties were also different between
species (Figure 4). As revealed by tensile strength tests, root
tensile strength decreased as root diameter increased (r = 051,
p< 0001). Analysis of covariance (D: F=52.8, p< 0.000; Species:
F=16.6, p< 0.000) showed that Achnatherum calamagrostis
had roots more resistant to traction than the two tree species, that
had similar responses to traction (post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test).
Relationship between erosion rates and
functional traits
Multivariate analysis revealed distinct clustering of the three
species (Figure 5) according to the two first axes of the PCA,
accounting for 46% and 30% of the variation in the data set
respectively.
Robinia pseudo acacia occupied the lower end of axis 2
whereas Pinus nigra austriaca occupied the lower end of axis
1 and the upper end of axis 2. Achnatherum calamagrostis
was located in the upper end of axis 1 and along the entire axis
2. RSD rate variation was consistent with the results of analysis
of variance, high erosion rates being graphically associated to
Pinus nigra and low erosion rates to Robinia pseudo acacia.
The analysis showed relationship between RSD rates and
some functional traits (Figure 5 and Table II). RSD rate was pos-
itively correlated to mean root diameter and negatively corre-
lated to the proportion of fine roots. However, root mass (RD
and V), root length density and external root surface did not
directly influence erosion rates.
There were also significant relationships between D and %FR
and other root traits that must be considered to interpret the
relationship between plant traits and the effect on erosion rates
(Table II). Both D and %FR were strongly correlated to RLD,
RSA and SRL, the former negatively and the latter positively.
Therefore, for a given root biomass, species with thinner roots
tend to have higher root–soil contact thanks to longer roots.
Discussion
Species effect on concentrated flow erosion rates
The present study clearly demonstrated that plant root systems
substantially decreased concentrated flow erosion rates, even
at very low densities at the first stages of plant development
(Table I and Figure 3). Here, we reported decreases of soil
detachment rates in the first 30 seconds of the tests ranging
from 72% (Pinus nigra) to 95% (Robinia pseudo acacia) on
average, with root densities of only 003 kg m–3. These values
are higher than those reported by Mamo and Bubenzer (2001)
and De Baets et al. (2006), who measured similar decreases
but for root densities higher than 1 kg m–3. These differences
may be attributed to differences in experimental parameters
such as flow shear stress and soil properties. Indeed, in our
study, we applied a flow shear stress of 52 Pa on marly

samples, whereas values ranged from 11 to 22 Pa on silt loam
in Mamo and Bubenzer (2001), and from 9 to 45 Pa on sandy
loam in De Baets et al. (2006). In addition, the flume bed and
the tape, have a different bed roughness than the soil sample,
which may cause higher flow velocities upslope of the sample.
This, also called clear water effect, may increase the vulnerabil-
ity of bare soil samples (control) to soil detachment, and thus
lead to an overestimation of the erosion reduction values. In
future experiments, such effect should be reduced by increas-
ing the roughness of the flume bed.
The use of a flume experiment presents some obvious
advantages such as the control of environmental parameters.
The observation of the effect of one species or individual on
erosion rates at a time, which is barely possible in the field, is
also easier as well as the reproducibility of the observations.
However, the method has some limitations, on top of which
the possible lack of connection with field processes which
may lead to difficulties when extrapolating the results. In addi-
tion, the pot size used here would be insufficient to investigate
the effectiveness of juvenile tree species roots, and bigger
samples would be required. Therefore, these results, which
refer to plants in the early stages of their development, must
be interpreted with caution and could be validated by further
experiments or field observations.
Plant morphological and biomechanical traits
The three species selected in our study presented important
morphological and ecological differences that appeared in the
trait values (Table I). Achnatherum calamagrostis, a grass
species successfully colonizing badland areas (Guàrdia et al.,
2000) and presenting a heart root system with many fibrous
roots developing from the base of the tussocks, had a high fine
roots content, high RLD and RSA. The tree species Robinia
pseudo acacia and Pinus nigra austriaca, both have a tap root
system, characterized at the seedling stage, by a strong vertical
root and many laterals. However, these two species had oppo-
site values on several traits. The former was characterized by
small diameters and high values of %FR, SRL, RLD and RSA
while the latter had opposite features. These morphological
differences may result from contrasted species growth patterns:
Robinia pseudo acacia (Fabaceae) being a fast-growing inva-
sive species particularly vigorous in poor and dry environments
(Boring and Swank, 1984), and Pinus nigra having a rather
slow-growing behaviour. Indeed, fast-growing woody species
generally have smaller diameters and greater SRL allowing
successful resource foraging and acquisition (Comas and
Eissenstat,
2004).
In
addition,
SRL
has
been
positively
correlated to root proliferation (Eissenstat, 1991), and may be
relevant to assess species ability to capture nutrients in
nutrient-rich patches in otherwise poor soils (Hodge, 2004)
and to colonize newly restored areas.

Species also differed regarding their biomechanical proper-
ties (Figure 4). Root tensile strength decreased as root diameter
increased, indicating that fine roots are the most resistant in
tension (Bischetti et al., 2005; De Baets et al., 2008; Burylo
et al., 2011). This relationship has been attributed to differences
in root structure and in particular to higher cellulose concentra-
tions in small roots (Genet et al., 2005). Hathaway and Penny
(1975) demonstrated that root elasticity decreased with increas-
ing lignin/cellulose ratio. Therefore, roots of tree species might
be weaker in tension than fibrous roots of grasses because of
their higher lignin content.
Erosion-reducing potential and plant traits
Our
results
highlighted
significant
correlations
between
concentrated flow erosion rates and functional traits (Figure 5
and Table I). RSD rate was positively correlated to root diameter
and negatively correlated to the percentage of fine roots: the
higher fine root content, the lower erosion rates. This result
confirmed the importance of small flexible roots (< 2 mm) that
hold soil particles together and increase soil shear strength
(Stokes et al., 2009). As fine roots are stronger in tension that
thick roots (Figure 4), many fine roots will be more efficient
than a few coarse roots to prevent soil erosion from concen-
trated flow. In addition, D and %FR are significantly correlated
to RLD, RSA and SRL, suggesting that these traits may also indi-
rectly influence erosion rates. Indeed, high values of RLD, RSA
and SRL imply more fine roots and more root–soil contact.
Several studies demonstrated the influence of RLD (De Baets
et al., 2006; De Baets et al., 2007) and RSA (Li et al., 1991)
on RSD rate but, to our knowledge, SRL has not yet been
related to erosion rates during concentrated flow.
However, although RD was previously found a relevant
parameter to predict the erosion-reducing effect of grasses
(De Baets et al., 2006), we found no direct relationship with
root density. This suggests that RD alone is not sufficient to
compare species effect on erosion rates and that other traits
must be considered, which is in accordance with the findings
of De Baets and coworkers (De Baets et al., 2007; De Baets
and Poesen, 2010) who stated that to compare the effectiveness
of species with contrasted root architectures, an interaction
term between RD and root diameter is needed.
Nevertheless, further laboratory and field experiments on
larger sets and mixture of species would bring a valuable
insight on the trait–erosion relationship. Moreover, we focused
on the mechanical effects of roots and only measured morpho-
logical traits whereas the effect of the rhizosphere on soil
stability include a wide range of processes (Angers and Caron,
1998), such as the exudation of cementing material (mucilage,
polysaccharides) or a strong biological activity (microbial or
myccorhyzal), that must be kept in mind when comparing
species suitability for erosion control.
The findings of our study could find useful implications, for
restoration purposes, in predicting plant root effects on erosive
dynamics and in identifying the most efficient species for erosion
control. This would make the diagnosis of ecosystem vulnerability
to environmental constraints and the evaluation of ecosystem func-
tioning after restoration more operational. The results presented
here suggest that fast-growing species, having higher fine roots
contents, could be efficient at the early stages of plant development
for soil reinforcement. Moreover, such species have fast growth
both above and below ground, which could also make them inter-
esting for fast vegetation cover development after restoration.
However, further investigations are necessary to confirm these
interpretations that remain speculative based on a small scale
study. In addition, while the results are interesting, the influence
of plant species and functional traits on erosion control and ecosys-
tem functioning as the plants, especially tree species, mature, must
be taken into consideration for a long-term sustainable manage-
ment of degraded lands. For example, as the trees grow, root
system morphological and architectural features change (Chiatante
et al., 2003), which may modify plant effects on soil processes. The
development of fast-growing pioneer species can quickly restore
some of the damaged or lost ecosystem services, here erosion
control and soil retention, but restoring one particular service,
can modify environmental conditions and can be detrimental to
the provision of other services (Ehrenfeld, 2000).
Understanding and predicting vegetation response to envi-
ronmental change and the effects of plant species on ecosystem
processes is a major challenge in applied ecology. During
the last decade, trait-based approaches have multiplied in
theoretical as well as in applied ecology to meet this objective.
In eroded areas, it is necessary to identify functional traits
related both to species response to erosive constraints and to
species effects on erosive processes. Lavorel and Garnier
(2002) formalized this idea and proposed the conceptual
response-and-effect framework, in which a varying degree of
overlap exists between response and effect traits.
The present study highlighted the role of fine roots in reduc-
ing erosion rates due to concentrated flow. In particular, the
percentage of fine roots was related to relative soil detachment
rates. In a previous study on species response to uprooting by
erosive forces (Burylo et al., 2009), percentage of fine roots
was identified as a relevant trait to evaluate and predict species
resistance to uprooting. In a context of land restoration, this
match between functional response and effect traits is promis-
ing, and further comparisons should be carried out.

Appendix
Detailed flow shear stress calculation
Flow shear stress (t) was calculated to evaluate the erosive
force of the concentrated flow simulated by the flume experi-
ment (De Baets et al., 2006, 2007) and to relate to erosion in
actively eroded gullies (Gimenez and Govers, 2002).
The following equations were used:

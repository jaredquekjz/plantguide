Summary
1. Great efforts have been made to control soil erosion by restoring plant communities in
degraded ecosystems world-wide. However, soil erosion has not been substantially reduced
mainly because current restoration strategies lead to large areas of mono-speciﬁc vegetation,
which are inefﬁcient in reducing soil erosion because of their simple canopy and root struc-
ture. Therefore, an advanced understanding of how community functional composition affects
soil erosion processes, as well as an improved restoration scheme to reduce soil erosion, is
urgently needed.
2. We investigated the effect of community functional composition on soil erosion in restored
semi-arid grasslands on the Loess Plateau of China. Community functional composition of 16
restored grasslands was quantiﬁed by community-weighted mean (CWM) and functional
diversity (FD) trait values, which were calculated from nine plant functional traits of thirteen
locally dominant plant species. Species richness and evenness were also measured. Soil erosion
rates were measured using standard erosion plots. The multimodel inference approach was
used to estimate the direction and the relative importance of these biodiversity indices in
reducing soil erosion.
3. A robust and strong negative effect of functional divergence (FDiv) on soil erosion was
found. The prevalence of particular trait combinations can also decrease soil erosion. The
greatest control over soil erosion was exerted when the community mean root diameter was
small and the root tensile strength was great.
4. Synthesis and applications: These ﬁndings imply that community functional diversity plays
an important role in reducing soil erosion in semi-arid restored grasslands. This means that
current restoration strategies can be greatly improved by incorporating community functional
diversity into restoration design. We propose a trait-based restoration framework for reducing
soil erosion, termed ‘SSM’ (Screening–Simulating–Maintaining). SSM aims to translate the
target of community functional diversity into community assemblages that can be manipu-
lated by practitioners. Based on this framework, a comprehensive procedure, highlighting
functional diversity as the primary concern in determining optimal community assemblages,
was developed to meet the pressing need for more effective restoration strategies to reduce
soil erosion.

Introduction
Soil erosion is one of the global environmental issues and
has been accelerating as a result of climate change and
anthropogenic activities, leading to severe degradation of
land and ecosystem functioning (Morgan 2004; Duran
Zuazo & Rodriguez Pleguezuelo 2008; Stokes et al. 2010).
Although much effort has been made, soil erosion has not
been substantially reduced mainly because current restora-
tion strategies lead to large areas of mono-speciﬁc vegeta-
tion, which are inefﬁcient in reducing soil erosion because

of their simple canopy and root structure (Cao, Chen &
Yu 2009; Stokes et al. 2010; Cao 2011). Therefore, the
major challenge facing restoration practitioners is how to
maximize the erosion-reducing capacity of restored vege-
tation by manipulating community composition and struc-
ture in restoration processes.
Trait-based approaches are increasingly used to under-
stand the relationship between community composition
and ecosystem processes (Lavorel & Garnier 2002; Diaz
et al. 2007; Garnier & Navas 2012). To date, a wide range
of ecosystem processes such as productivity, litter decom-
position and nutrient cycling have all been well related to
different
community
functional
components,
each
of
which represents different aspects of community func-
tional composition (Garnier et al. 2004; Mokany, Ash &
Roxburgh 2008; Laughlin 2011; Mouillot et al. 2011;
Clark et al. 2012). These studies have suggested that trait-
based approaches have greater explanatory power than
traditional species-based approaches because plant func-
tional traits, rather than taxonomic identity, drive ecosys-
tem processes (Cadotte, Carscadden & Mirotchnick 2011).
Moreover, some compelling mechanisms have been pro-
posed to explain this effect. The biomass ratio hypothesis
holds that the rates of ecosystem processes are controlled
by the traits of the most abundant species present in the
community, which are often characterized by community-
weighted mean (CWM) trait values (Grime 1998; Diaz
et al. 2007). In contrast, the diversity hypothesis proposes
that the effects of species on ecosystem processes are
mainly due to non-additive effects, such as complementar-
ity effects or facilitation, among coexisting species with
different trait values, which can be indicated by various
functional diversity indices (FD) (Garnier & Navas 2012;
Dias et al. 2013; Lavorel 2013). Given these methodologi-
cal strengths and a well-developed theoretical framework,
trait-based approaches have great potential for applica-
tion in ecological restoration (De Baets et al. 2009; Bury-
lo, Dutoit & Rey 2014; Laughlin 2014). However, little
effort has been made to use a trait-based approach to
explore the effects of community functional composition
on
soil
erosion
processes.
Even
fewer
studies
have
attempted to transfer the ﬁndings to the design of restora-
tion schemes in restoration projects.
Plant functional traits have been well recognized as
important predictors for soil erosion. In theory, both
plant morphological traits, such as root diameter, and
biomechanical traits, such as root tensile strength, have
all been shown to signiﬁcantly affect soil erosion (Gyssels
et al. 2005; De Baets et al. 2006, 2008; Pohl et al. 2009;
Burylo et al. 2012a,b). In practice, some methodological
frameworks have been developed for selecting appropriate
species to control soil erosion (De Baets et al. 2009; Bury-
lo, Dutoit & Rey 2014). However, the vast majority of
current studies have been conducted at the species level,
focusing on either the effects of different traits of one sin-
gle species on soil erosion or the differences among differ-
ent species in reducing soil erosion. Relatively few studies
have considered the overall effect of species with different
trait values on soil erosion at the ecosystem level (Burylo,
Dutoit & Rey 2014). In fact, some researchers have pro-
posed that a mixture of species may control soil erosion
better than monocultures because of their diverse and
developed root systems, but empirical tests are rare (Reu-
bens et al. 2007). Therefore, understanding the effects of
community functional composition on soil erosion is
essential for an advanced understanding of biodiversity–
ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships, and to the
development of more effective restoration schemes to
reduce erosion.
Here, we investigate the effect of community functional
composition on soil erosion in a restored, semi-arid grass-
land on the Loess Plateau of China. We aim to determine
the direction and relative magnitude of the effects of dif-
ferent community functional components on soil erosion
rates, ultimately to improve current restoration practices
by incorporating this trait-based approach into restora-
tion schemes.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This
study
was
conducted
in
the
Yangjuangou
watershed
(36°420N, 109°310E), located in the central region of the Loess
Plateau in China. The climate is semi-arid and continental, with a
mean annual precipitation of 535 mm and a mean annual tem-
perature of 14 °C. The soils are mainly Calcaric Cambisols, and
the dominant vegetation consists of replanted forests, primarily
dominated by Robinia pseudoacacia, and restored grasslands, pri-
marily dominated by Artemisia sacrorum, Stipa bungeana and
Artemisia scoparia. This watershed is a region with typical, severe
soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. Previous studies have shown
that the mean soil erosion rate was 6273 t ha1 year1 from
1992 to 1996 and 3641 t ha1 year1 in 2006 (Liu et al. 2012).
VEGETATION SURVEYS AND MEASUREMENTS OF SOIL
EROSION
Sixteen herbaceous communities were selected for vegetation sur-
veying, plant trait sampling and the establishment of run-off
plots. These communities were scattered across the watershed and
were located on isolated slopes with similar steepness and soil
conditions but contrasting species compositions because of differ-
ent restoration strategies (Fig. 1).
In each community, three run-off plots of 2 9 10 m were
established to monitor soil erosion. Each plot was surrounded by
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) boards, which were embedded in the
soil at a depth of 50 cm to impede the lateral movement of sedi-
ment and water. A PVC pipe was installed at the bottom of each
plot to transfer the run-off and sediment to a bucket. After each
rainfall event, the sediments collected in the PVC pipes and
together with the sediments in the bucket they were collected,
dried and weighed. In total, ﬁve erosive rainfall events were
recorded across the growing season of 2013 (May–October),
which corresponded to the rainfall characteristics of this area
(few rainfall events concentrated in July and August). To avoid

the confounding effects of antecedent soil water content on ero-
sion, we selected three erosive rainfall events with sufﬁcient inter-
vals of time to perform our analysis. Our previous studies have
demonstrated
that
the
spatial
variation
of
rainfall
in
this
watershed is insigniﬁcant, partly because of the relatively small
total area (202 km2) (Fu et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2012; Hou et al.
2014; Zhu et al. 2014).
To minimize the effects of vegetation surveys and plant sam-
pling on the run-off plots, we conducted non-destructive sam-
pling.
Adjacent
to
each
plot,
ﬁve
1 9 1 m
quadrats
were
established. Mean values obtained in the ﬁve quadrats were used
to represent the vegetation composition of the main plot. All
plant species present in each quadrat were identiﬁed, the number
of individuals per species was counted, and the coverage of each
species was estimated to the nearest percentage. Adult plants that
were completely unshaded and free from attack by herbivores or
pathogens
were
selected
for
functional
trait
measurements.
Finally, two soil cores were sampled to the depth of 20 cm for
each quadrat using a cylinder soil corer (diameter = 35 cm), to
determine the physical and chemical properties of the soil.
PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS
Nine plant functional traits that were most likely to be related to
the soil erosion process were selected (Pohl et al. 2009; Burylo
et al. 2012a,b). Based on a pilot vegetation survey and ﬁeld
observations, we selected 13 species, which accounted for more
than 80% of the biomass of each of the sampled communities, to
measure all nine functional traits. For each species, at least 15
individuals were sampled, and 10 leaves per individual were ran-
domly selected and scanned using a universal scanner (HP
G3110; Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at a
resolution of 400 dpi. Digital images were analysed to determine
the leaf area using software developed for leaf area measurements
(Leaf Area Measurement, version 1.3; University of Shefﬁeld,
Shefﬁeld, UK).
The root systems of these sampled individual plants were cut
at the root collar, washed and then scanned at a resolution of
400 dpi. Five root morphological parameters: root length, root
mean diameter, the external root surface, root volume and the
percentage of ﬁne roots were then determined using WinRHIZO
Pro (version 2004a; Regent Instrument, Quebec, Canada). Subse-
quently, root tensile strength was measured with a universal ten-
sile and compression test machine (Instron 5942, Canton, MA,
USA). For each individual of each species, the whole root system
was decomposed into separate root sections and numbered, and
ﬁnally, 10 root sections were randomly selected to test root ten-
sile strength. Using the same machine, we also tested the leaf ten-
sile strength and leaf punch force of at least 10 randomly chosen
leaves for each individual of each species.
COMMUNITY FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION
In total, we selected seven indices to characterize community
functional composition, each of which represents different aspects
of
community
composition
(Table 1).
Functional
divergence
(FDiv) characterizes how the abundance-weighted traits deviate
from the gravity centre of the functional space, and thus higher
FDiv may suggest a high degree of niche differentiation. Func-
tional evenness (FEve) measures the degree of regularity of these
abundance-weighted traits across the multidimensional functional
space. Functional richness (FRic) quantiﬁes the amount of func-
tional trait space occupied by a community. The three comple-
mentary indices are independent of each other and together
provide a comprehensive description of community functional
composition (Villeger, Mason & Mouillot 2008). CWM of studied
traits was aggregated in PCA axes. CWM_PC1 mainly reﬂected
the variation in the community mean root diameter, which was
opposed to the percentage of ﬁne roots. CWM_PC2 represented
the variation in root tensile strength, which was in the same
direction as leaf tensile strength and punch force. Species abun-
dance was included as mean values of cover estimates across rep-
licated plots. Species richness (S) and Shannon evenness index (J)
were also calculated.
According to Mouillot et al. (2011), these indices can be cate-
gorized into three biodiversity components: taxonomic diversity

(S and J), functional identity (CWM_PC1 and CWM_PC2) and
functional diversity (FRic, FEve and FDiv), each of which is
known to inﬂuence ecosystem processes. Species richness and
evenness were believed to be important drivers of some ecosystem
processes, such as productivity, in the ﬁrst-generation BEF stud-
ies (Naeem et al. 1994; Wilsey & Potvin 2000; Shahid Naeem
et al. 2009). The second-generation BEF studies, characterized by
the use of trait-based approaches, have suggested that a large
amount of variation in ecosystem processes can be explained by
functional identity (i.e., particular functional traits) of the domi-
nant species across a wide range of spatial scales (Grime 1998;
Garnier et al. 2004; Cornwell et al. 2008; Mokany, Ash & Rox-
burgh 2008). More recently, functional diversity is increasingly
used as an important predictor of ecosystem processes (Schum-
acher & Roscher 2009; Mouillot et al. 2011; Lavorel 2013).
Therefore, synthesizing all of these biodiversity components into
one single analysis is critical not only to capture the overall per-
formance of the communities being studied, but also to evaluate
their relative effects, which are rarely considered in the existing
literature (Mouillot et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2012).
DATA ANALYSIS
We ﬁrst examined the bivariate relationships between soil ero-
sion rates and the seven biodiversity indices. To estimate the
effects of each of the biodiversity indices, we employed the mul-
timodel inference (MMI) approach, which makes inferences
based on a set of best models, rather than one single best
model, and therefore can provide more stable and reliable infer-
ence results than traditional statistical inference (Burnham &
Anderson 2002).
Given the heterogeneity of rainfall events, we built separate
models for each of the three erosive rainfall events to examine
whether the effect of community functional composition on soil
erosion rates was robust across these rainfall events. The global
models included all seven biodiversity indices. A model selec-
tion method was employed to generate all possible candidate
models from the global models. These models were then ranked
according to the second-order Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AICc). The effect size of each of the biodiversity indices was
indicated
by
the
averaged
model
parameters,
which
were
derived from averaging the parameters of the models whose
accumulated
model
probability
exceeded
95%.
The
relative
importance of the biodiversity indices was also evaluated by
summing the Akaike’s weights of each model that included the
predictors of interest.
All of the analyses were performed using R software, including
package ‘MuMIn’, ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham 2009; R Development
Core Team 2014; Barton 2015).
Results
The biodiversity indices differed greatly in determining soil
erosion rates (Fig. 2, Table 2). Speciﬁcally, FDiv was nega-
tively correlated with soil erosion rates across the three ero-
sive rainfall events and explained 400%, 392% and 381%
of the variation in soil erosion rates, respectively, suggest-
ing a considerable erosion-reducing capacity. In contrast,
CWM_PC1 was positively associated with soil erosion rates
and accounted for 586%, 414% and 359% of the varia-
tion in soil erosion rates, respectively. Combined with the
results of previous PCAs, this result indicates that smaller
community means of root diameter reduce soil erosion.
Finally, the remaining ﬁve indices did not exhibit a signiﬁ-
cant relationship with soil erosion rates.
The best eight models for each rainfall event are pre-
sented and ranked according to the AICc (Table 3). Most
of these models exhibited remarkably high R-squared val-
ues, especially for event 1 and event 3 which presented
minimum R-squared values of greater than 60%, indicat-
ing signiﬁcant explanatory power for variations in soil
erosion rates. Speciﬁcally, nearly all models included
FDiv, and when FDiv was removed, there was a substan-
tial decrease in the R-squared values and a sharp increase
in the AICc, indicating the great importance of FDiv in
these models. Many models contained either CWM_PC1
or CWM_PC2 as important predictor variable, which
appeared to vary across different rainfall events. In addi-
tion, species richness was included in most of the models
for rainfall event 1.
The absence of extreme values of model probabilities,
indicated by the similar Akaike’s weights, suggests that
there were not great differences between these best models
in predicting soil erosion rates (Table 3). In this case,
model averaging can be used to evaluate the effects of
these predictor variables by estimating averaged model
parameters. Table 4 displays these averaged model param-
eters, which were calculated from the models whose

FDiv exhibited a robust and high importance value. The

and seemed to be contingent upon speciﬁc rainfall events.

erosion rates across all of the rainfall events. The differ-
ences among these three indices in determining soil ero-
sion rates may originate from their different emphases on
community functional composition. FRic represents the
functional space occupied by a community, while FEve
quantiﬁes how regularly the trait space is ﬁlled. FDiv
measures how the most abundant species diverge from the
centroid of the community, and thus may be interpreted
as the degree of niche differentiation (Villeger, Mason &
Mouillot 2008; Mouillot et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2012). In
the present study, it is the degree of deviation from the
community centroid that strongly affects soil erosion
rates. Some recent studies have reported similar results
but with regard to other ecosystem processes (Mouillot
et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2012). For example, indices
focused on divergence better explained the variation in
biomass production than those focused on evenness in
Minnesota grasslands (Clark et al. 2012). In summary,
this result suggests that different FD components may dif-
fer greatly in capturing the variation of soil erosion rates
due to different emphases on community functional com-
position.
The mechanistic understanding for the signiﬁcant FDiv
effect can be related to both the complementarity effect
(Naeem et al. 1994; Loreau et al. 2001) and the sampling
effect (Huston 1997). First, higher FDiv values mean
greater niche differentiation, and thus fewer overlaps in
plant morphological traits among species within a com-
munity, leading to a more complete use of above-ground
and below-ground space (Naeem et al. 1994; Diaz et al.
2007). Consequently, in semi-arid grasslands, communities
with higher FDiv values, which were calculated from ero-
sion-relevant
plant
morphological
and
biomechanical
traits, tend to develop dense canopies and root systems,
which can efﬁciently shelter and anchor the soil (Reubens
et al. 2007). At the same time, higher FDiv values in the
present analyses suggest that more abundant species have
more extreme biomechanical trait values, resulting in

cess as a function of a variety of plant community diversity and

more ﬂexible canopies and root systems and thereby rein-
forcing the protective effect of plants against soil erosion
(Gyssels et al. 2005; Reubens et al. 2007). In addition,
facilitation among species with contrasting trait values
can also contribute to this FDiv effect (Hooper et al.
2005; Reubens et al. 2007). For example, in the Great
Basin deserts of western North America, deep-rooted spe-
cies, which increase slope stability by penetrating soil slip
surface, can provide 20–50% water to shallow-rooted spe-
cies, which ﬁx surface soil by their ﬁbrous root systems
(Norris et al. 2008; Chapin, Matson & Vitousek 2011).
Secondly, higher FDiv trait values increase the probability
of the presence of species with diverse root characteristics,
which are more likely to contain pairs of species that are
complementary or facilitative to each other, leading to the
decrease in soil erosion (Huston 1997; Flombaum, Sala &
Rastetter 2014). In summary, communities with higher
FDiv values may efﬁciently reduce soil erosion through
both the complementary and sampling effect.
THE EFFECTS OF CWM TRAITS ON SOIL EROSION
Similar to FDiv, CWM_PC1 and CWM_PC2 were also
found to signiﬁcantly affect soil erosion rates. Previous
studies have reported signiﬁcant CWM effect, however,
the direction of the effects depends on both the functional
traits selected and the ecosystem processes being studied
(Mokany, Ash & Roxburgh 2008; Laughlin 2011). The
mechanisms underlying the CWM effect fall into two
broad categories: hydrological and mechanical (Reubens
et al. 2007). First, penetrating roots create soil macrop-
ores, improving the water inﬁltration capacity of soils
(Gyssels et al. 2005; De Baets et al. 2006). Therefore, ﬁner
and denser roots have a greater capacity to increase water
inﬁltration and reduce soil erosion. In this study, commu-
nities with lower mean root diameters were represented by
lower CWM_PC1 scores and soil erosion rates decreased
most signiﬁcantly during rainfall event 2. Secondly, plant
roots can reinforce soils through their tensile strength
(Gyssels et al. 2005; De Baets et al. 2006; Duran Zuazo &
Rodriguez Pleguezuelo 2008). The downward penetration
of roots increases the shear strength of soils at the sheared
surface (Reubens et al. 2007; De Baets et al. 2008), while
roots extending laterally reinforce soils by increasing
in-plane tensile strength (Reubens et al. 2007). In the
present study, variations in root tensile strength were pri-
marily represented by CWM_PC2, which showed most
signiﬁcant negative effects on soil erosion rates during
rainfall event 3. Taken together, CWM trait values for
root traits can also signiﬁcantly affect soil erosion, either
by regulating water inﬁltration capacity of soils or by
physically reinforcing soil mass.
CONTINGENCY OF THE EFFECTS OF CWM AND
SPECIES RICHNESS
The present study revealed not only a signiﬁcant CWM
effect, but also a variation of this effect across different
rainfall events. This variation may reﬂect the contingency
of CWM effect upon rainfall intensity (Gyssels et al.
2005; De Baets et al. 2008; Norris et al. 2008). When rain-
fall intensity is low (rainfall event 2), CWM_PC1 seemed
to play a more signiﬁcant role in reducing soil erosion.
The reason is that at low rainfall intensity, soil erosion is
largely affected by the inﬁltration rates of rainfall. This
can be greatly enhanced by the penetration of ﬁne roots
because of a greater speciﬁc surface area than thicker
roots (Reubens et al. 2007; De Baets et al. 2008). In con-
trast, CWM_PC2 became increasingly important as rain-
fall intensity increased. At high rainfall intensity (rainfall
event 3), the major process responsible for soil erosion is
the scouring of run-off on surface soils. Scouring can be
greatly mitigated by roots with greater tensile strength

Community functional diversity reduces soil erosion

(Reubens et al. 2007; De Baets et al. 2008). Between these
two extremes, the effects of CWM_PC1 and CWM_PC2
appear to be comparable at intermediate rainfall intensity
(rainfall event 1) because of the balance between the inﬁl-
tration and scouring processes (Gyssels et al. 2005; Norris
et al. 2008).
Species richness was also found to have a signiﬁcant
effect on soil erosion rates but only during rainfall event
1 (intermediate rainfall intensity). Because a species can
be conceived as the integration of various functional traits
(both erosion-relevant and erosion-irrelevant traits), the
overall performance of these traits in reducing soil erosion
may be covered either by CWM_PC1 at low rainfall
intensity or by CWM_PC2 at high rainfall intensity (Reu-
bens et al. 2007; Burylo et al. 2012b). Therefore, only
when rainfall intensity was intermediate, the overall effect
of species richness became prominent. On the other hand,
in our systems, high species richness is the result of the
addition of species with coarse and succulent (low tensile
strength) roots such as Viola verecunda, which are inefﬁ-
cient in reducing erosion. Therefore, the average erosion-
reducing capacity decreased as species richness increased.
It should be noted that the effect of species richness on
soil erosion may differ widely among different ecosystems
and which species contribute to the increase in species
richness (Reubens et al. 2007). Although a deﬁnite conclu-
sion cannot be reached in this study due to the limited
number of rainfall events, the present ﬁndings provided
valuable clues to further explore the dependence of CWM
and species richness effects on rainfall intensity.
MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
Our study suggests that functional divergence of restored
grassland
communities
is
an
important
predictor
of
soil erosion rates in semi-arid grassland systems. The
prevalence of particular trait combinations may also
reduce soil erosion to varying degrees, depending on the
intensity of rainfall events. These results imply that the
restoration goal of reducing soil erosion can be better
achieved by managing the functional composition of
restored communities. However, practitioners can only
actually manipulate speciﬁc plant species (which species)
and their abundance (how many individuals), rather than
the community functional indices (Laughlin 2014). There-
fore, a trait-based restoration framework is urgently
needed to bridge the gap between what we know and how
to do it.
Here, we proposed such a framework. This framework
contains three stages: screening, simulating and maintain-
ing and includes feedbacks allowing for dynamic adjust-
ments (Fig. 4). Each stage consists of several steps of
decision, accompanied by key points or recommendations.
Below, we brieﬂy show how these steps can be taken to
develop speciﬁc restoration strategies.
Stage I: Screening. The objective of this stage is to ﬁnd
appropriate species that will be used in stage II. First,
a regional species pool should be constructed. This can
be done through a variety of approaches, such as syn-
thesizing existing data bases and reviewing relevant lit-
erature (Dias et al. 2013). Then, key traits inﬂuencing
soil erosion should be identiﬁed by conducting pilot
studies such as small-scale artiﬁcial rainfall experiments
(De Baets et al. 2009). Finally, appropriate species
(i.e., species that can be established easily and perform
well in reducing soil erosion) can be selected.
Stage II: Simulating. This stage aims to attain the opti-
mal combinations of species and their abundances.
First, as many simulations as possible (>5000) should
be run (Dias et al. 2013). Then, the functional diversity
indices can be calculated and the community assem-
blages ranked according to their FDiv values (Dias

et al. 2013; Laughlin 2014). Before implementation,
pilot experiments should be carried out to validate the
efﬁciency of these community assemblages. If neces-
sary, simulations should be replicated until the desired
community assemblages are selected.
Stage III: Maintaining. This stage is designed to estab-
lish the communities and maintain their functional
composition.
After
establishment,
regular
surveys
should be conducted to monitor the dynamics of com-
munity functional composition (Andre F. Clewell &
Aronson 2013). If the communities become function-
ally converged (decreased FDiv), appropriate manage-
ment options, such as soil nutrient management and
prescribed disturbance, should be taken to maintain
functional composition (James et al. 2010; Sandel,
Corbin & Krupa 2011).
In summary, the novel restoration framework repre-
sents an attempt to translate trait-based ecological under-
standing into detailed restoration guidelines that can be
easily implemented by practitioners. Although it may
require empirical tests in real restoration projects, it pro-
vides guidance for much-needed effective restoration strat-
egies for reducing soil erosion in restoration processes.

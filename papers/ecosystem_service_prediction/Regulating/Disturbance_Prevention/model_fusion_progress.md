# Disturbance Prevention Model-Fusion Progress (Methods 1 & 2)

No primary papers are currently stored in this folder. The planned reference (Miedema Brown & Anand 2022) remains outstanding; only an abstract was available earlier and has been removed to avoid clutter.

## Next steps

1. Obtain the full PDF for Miedema Brown & Anand (2022) *Plant Functional Traits as Measures of Ecosystem Service Provision* or other disturbance-oriented trait syntheses (fire, flood, wind resilience).
2. Once available, extract quantitative trait → resistance/resilience coefficients (e.g. bark thickness vs. fire survival, root depth vs. flood resistance) to seed Methods 1 and 2.

Until then, disturbance-prevention model fusion cannot proceed.

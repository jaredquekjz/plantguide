Land-use intensiﬁcation can importantly inﬂuence terrestrial ecosystem services by altering plant functional
traits. Although we know that functional traits inﬂuence both ecosystem properties and services, we do not
fully understand the mechanistic pathways governing these relationships nor how they will respond to global cli-
mate change. To identify the impact pathways of land-use intensity on hydrological services under changing pre-
cipitation regimes, we monitored hydrological services in 15 plots of different land-use types during 25
precipitation events (6 light, 8 moderate, and 11 heavy rains). Bayesian structural equation modeling was used
to quantify the direct and indirect effects between land-use intensity, functional trait components (community
weighted mean [CWM] and functional diversity [FD]), ecosystem properties (canopy density, litter fall and
ﬁne-root density), and hydrological services under different rainfall intensities. The impact of land-use intensity
on hydrological service provisioning was regulated by plant functional traits regardless of intensity rainfall.
Under light and moderate rain, FD signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced hydrological services by altering canopy density and
ﬁne-root density, but we found no signiﬁcant effect of CWMs. Under heavy rain, FD had signiﬁcant, and greater,
impacts on hydrological services than CWM of traits, although CWM of traits inﬂuenced hydrological services
provision indirectly by altering canopy density and ﬁne-root density. Land-use intensity indirectly affected hy-
drological services mainly by altering FD regardless of rainfall intensiﬁcation, suggesting that the reduction of
niche differentiation caused by land-use intensity is the main mechanism of hydrological services degradation.
Our results suggested that the effect of land-use intensity on hydrological services are likely to change with

1. Introduction
Land-use intensiﬁcation is a primary driver of global environmental
change and has been accelerating as a result of increasing anthropo-
genic activities, leading to severe degradation of ecosystem services
that are essential for the well-being of humanity (Díaz et al., 2007;
Allan et al., 2015; Chillo et al., 2018). Land-use intensity can not only af-
fect the provisioning of ecosystem services directly (e.g., production
(Allan et al., 2015), soil fertility (Gelaw et al., 2014)), but also inﬂuence
ecosystem services indirectly (e.g., biomass (De Avila et al., 2018), soil
retention (Zheng et al., 2008)) by altering plant functional traits (Ali
et al., 2019; Chillo et al., 2017) or ecosystem properties (Zheng et al.,
2008; Wen et al.,2017). While these relationships have been docu-
mented around the world (Díaz et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008; Allan
et al., 2015), we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how ecosys-
tem services respond to land-use intensity (Chillo et al., 2018). This cru-
cially reduces our ability to predict how different land-use change
scenarios will affect ecosystem service production, and therefore de-
velop scientiﬁcally robust conservation plans (Lamarque et al., 2014).
There are three main hurdles in our search for the mechanisms un-
derlying ecosystem services responses to land-use intensity. First, the
role of different functional trait components in the relationship between
land-use intensity and ecosystem services remains uncertain (Díaz
et al., 2007; Mouillot et al., 2013; Chillo et al., 2018). The focus is on
whether the traits of dominant species (denoted by community-
weighted mean [CWM] of traits) or trait distribution among species
(denoted by functional diversity [FD]) determine the quality and quan-
tity of ecosystem service production (Lavorel, 2013; Cadotte, 2017). For
example, the CWM of traits, rather than functional diversity, was found
to be a more valuable predictor of the effects of land-use intensity on the
rate of nutrient recycling (Finegan et al., 2015) and primary production
(Conti and Díaz, 2013). However, other researchers have obtained con-
ﬂicting results of FD offers greater explanatory power in fodder provi-
sion and carbon storage than CWM of traits (Cadotte et al., 2011;
Lavorel, 2013; Mensah et al., 2016). It is clear, therefore, that further
studies are needed to identify what components of plant functional
traits are responsible for modulating the responses of ecosystem ser-
vices to land-use intensity.
Second, the pathways that regulate the impact of land-use intensity
and ecosystem services are understudied. Some studies have found that
ecosystem properties are the most important mediators of the impact of
land-use intensity on ecosystem services. For instance, high-intensity
land use led to reduce soil retention by changing litter fall (Zheng
et al., 2008) and canopy density (Salemi et al., 2013). Further, we
know that ecosystem properties can also be affected by plant functional
traits. For example, leaf dry matter content (Lamarque et al., 2014), as
well as functional evenness (Lundholm et al., 2015), affect the produc-
tion of litter fall. Most studies have focused on the path between three
variables: land-use intensity, ecosystem properties, ecosystem services
(Zheng et al., 2008; Salemi et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017), or land-use in-
tensity, functional traits, ecosystem services (Díaz et al., 2007; Allan
et al., 2015). Few studies have explored the relationship among all
four variables (land-use intensity, functional traits, ecosystem proper-
ties, ecosystem services) (Chillo et al., 2018), which obfuscates our
search for underlying mechanisms.
Third, it is reasonable to expect that the mechanism of the impact of
land-use intensity on key ecosystem services may vary with environ-
mental conditions. For example, land-use intensity mat increase litter
decomposition through indirect effects on plant traits(Chillo et al.,
2018), however, a drought caused by climate change may reduce this
effect, as it causes litter accumulation by altering functional traits to-
ward more resource-conservative strategy (greater leaf dry matter con-
tent, lower leaf nitrogen concentrations) (Lamarque et al., 2014).
Unfortunately, we know little about the mechanisms associated with
other services, including hydrological services, key for plant growth
and groundwater replenishment (Zheng et al., 2008). Hydrological ser-
vices are clearly affected by both land-use and rainfall intensity at
the local and global scale (Cao et al., 2008; Salemi et al., 2013) and
are expected to be changed even further from baseline conditions,
as global climate change continues (Donat et al., 2016; Schär et al.,
2016). However, the mechanism of how land-use intensity impacts
hydrological services is still unclear and therefore, so too is how
they will respond to changes in rainfall frequency and magnitude.
Given predicted shifts in rainfall regime with global climate change,
revealing the internal mechanisms of the impact of land-use inten-
sity on hydrological services under different rainfall will be crucial
for generating scientiﬁcally-grounded, and sustainable land man-
agement strategies.
To try to tackle these challenges, we measured hydrological services
in 15 land-use plots along the land-use intensity gradient for 25 rainfall
events (including 6 light, 8 moderate, and 11 heavy) in Hainan Island,
China. We also measured 5 plant functional traits(tree height, leaf thick-
ness, speciﬁc leaf area, leaf dry mass content, and leaf tissue density)
and 3 ecosystem properties (canopy density, litter fall, and ﬁne-root
density) that relate to hydrological services in each plot. We next built
an informed Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) based on cur-
rent knowledge about the relationships among land-use intensity, func-
tional traits, ecosystem properties and hydrological services (Díaz et al.,
2007; Carreño-Rocabado et al., 2016; Chillo et al., 2018). We thoroughly
examined the effects of different components of functional traits

(Fig. 1), including CWM of traits and FD. Our aim is to reveal the im-
pact mechanisms of land-use intensity on hydrological ecosystem
services. The speciﬁc objectives in this paper are to: (i) determine
the factors, namely CWM of traits and FD, that contribute more to
hydrological services following changes in land-use intensity; (ii) as-
sess the relationships among with land-use intensity, functional
traits, ecosystem properties and hydrological services; (iii) explore
how the environment change (precipitation magnitude) affects
these relationships.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study site
The study was conducted in the Hongmao Village, located in the
south-eastern Baisha County, Hainan Island, China(19°4′ N,
109°31′ E) (Fig.2). The area has a tropical monsoon climate, with a
mean annual temperature of 20–24 °C and mean annual precipitation
of 1800–2900 mm. The rainy season is mainly from May to November.
The main parent material of soil is granite and the predominant soil
type is latosols (Yang et al., 2016). Prior to 2004 local residents had
been destroying the forest using slash-and-burn techniques, and
many natural forests were turned into artiﬁcial forests. After 2004, nat-
ural forests in this area were protected, but existing plantations were
permitted as a mean to increase farm income. The main land use/land
cover types of this region include mature forests, secondary forests,
areca (Areca catechu) plantations, and monocultural rubber (Hevea
brasiliensis) plantations. Occasionally, Alpinia oxyphylla, a medicinal
plant, is intercropped with rubber to increase farm income. The area
of above ﬁve forests accounted for 54.15%, 19.7%, 3.79%, 8.58%, and
6.99% of the study area, respectively.
The secondary forests and all plantations were transformed
from mature forests. Most of the other vegetation including
weeds in areca and rubber forests had been thoroughly removed
by weeding. The dominant plant species of mature forests included
Castanopsis ﬁssa, Lasianthus chinensis Benth, Camellia sinensis var.
assamica, Dacrydium pierrei, Ternstroemia gymnanthera, Melastoma
sanguineum Sims, and Syzygium chunianum. The dominant plant
species of secondary forests were Wrightia pubescens, Psychotria
rubra, Castanopsis jucunda Hance, Aporosa dioica, Glochidion
sphaerogynum, and Lithocarpus corneus.
2.2. Land-use intensity gradient
We established land-use intensity gradient based on the common
land-use types and management intensity. We ﬁrst selected locations
within the ﬁve dominant land-use classes, including mature forests, sec-
ondary forests, areca forests, monocultural rubber plantations and rub-
ber intercropped with Alpinia oxyphylla plantations. Within each land-
use type, we selected three different management intensities based on
ﬁeld monitoring and surveys. Land-use intensity was assessed based
on six parameters related to ecosystem properties, input and output of
the production system in each plant community sample (Erb et al.,
2013; Carreño-Rocabado et al., 2016). The six parameters included
management intensity (biomass loss caused by the disturbance events),
frequency of management practices (disturbance events), age of current
system, magnitude of disturbance (percentage of undisturbed forest in a
radius of 1 km), time since disturbance (time for natural regeneration),
and standing biomass (indicate species richness). To reduce the dimen-
sionality of our predictor variables, and control for potential collinear-
ities, our ﬁnal metric of land-use intensity was calculated by using
principal component analysis (see details in Table S1).
2.3. Plant functional traits
We set up a 20 m × 5 m research plot in a representative area of each
research site. The identity of all plants and community structure in each
research plot (20 m × 5 m) were determined in August 2016. Dominant
species in each plot were selected as those that together constituted at
least 80% of the total community biomass (Conti and Díaz, 2013;
Finegan et al., 2015).
Five important plant functional traits, including tree height (H), leaf
thickness (LT), speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC),
and leaf tissue density (LTD) were measured in the ﬁeld following the
methodologies from Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). We chose
these functional traits because they are sensitive to land-use intensity
(Allan et al., 2015; Chillo et al., 2018), and profoundly affect ecosystem
properties and processes associated with hydrological services
(Lundholm et al., 2015; Finegan et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2018). Vegetation
height is related to canopy density, litter fall and ﬁne-root density
(Lavorel, 2013; Conti and Díaz, 2013). Leaf speciﬁc leaf area and leaf tis-
sue density directly affect water consumption through photosynthesis
and transpiration (Yin et al., 2018), and indirect affect interception of
rainfall by canopy density (Lundholm et al., 2015). Leaf thickness and

leaf dry matter content can affect rainfall interception via litter fall
(Lohbeck et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017). The functional traits values for
all the species included in the study are presented in Table S2.
2.4. CWMs and FD
As recommended by empirical studies, CWM of traits were calcu-
lated as the mean trait value weighted by species' relative abundance
in the community (Díaz et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2016; Häger and
Avalos, 2017). We calculated the CWM for each of above functional
traits (see details in Table S3) based on the methods of previous studies
(Shen et al., 2016; Häger and Avalos, 2017), and then, CWM of studied
traits was aggregated in PCA axes (Zhu et al., 2015) and results showed
that all CWM of measured traits exhibited two principal components
(see details in Table S4). CWM.PC1 mainly represented the variation
in the community mean leaf dry mass content. CWM.PC2 mainly
reﬂected the variation in leaf tissue density and speciﬁc leaf area.
Three complementary indices were used to measure FD (Villéger
et al., 2008), including functional richness (FRic), functional evenness
(FEve), and functional divergence (FDiv), each of which is known to
be closely related to land-use intensity(Díaz et al., 2007; Carreño-
Rocabado et al., 2016), and inﬂuence ecosystem functions and services
(Conti and Díaz, 2013; Zhu et al., 2015; Finegan et al., 2015). The differ-
ences among these three indices in determining ecosystem functions
and services originate from their different emphases on community
functional composition. FRic measures the dispersion of species in the
functional traits space (Villéger et al., 2008; Schmera et al., 2009),
while FEve quantiﬁes how regularly the trait space is ﬁlled (Chillo
et al., 2018). FDiv measures how the most abundant species diverge
from the centroid of the community (Zhu et al., 2015). FRic and FDiv
may be interpreted as the degree of niche differentiation in plant com-
munities (Díaz et al., 2007; Finegan et al., 2015). The calculation
methods of the three indices of FD were consistent with those from
Villéger et al. (2008) and Carreño-Rocabado et al. (2012).
All CWM of traits and FD (see details in Table S3) were calculated
using the FDiversity software (Casanoves et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2017).
2.5. Ecosystem properties
We measured three ecosystem properties closely related to hydro-
logical services: canopy density (CD), litter fall (LF), and ﬁne-root den-
sity (FRD). These properties are thought to be related to land-use
intensity (Allan et al., 2015; Chillo et al., 2018), and considered good
proxies of ecosystem hydrological services. In this study, we try to use
the relatively stable parameter to reﬂect the properties of different for-
est ecosystems. The ecosystem properties values for all the forest plots
included in the study are presented in Table S3.
Canopy density was recorded every two months during sunny
weather between September 2016 and August 2017 using a ﬁsh-eye
camera to capture nine images of each runoff plot. The average canopy
density was used for analysis.
Litter fall was estimated each month from September 2016 to Au-
gust 2017 by collecting the litter from three 1 m × 1 m quadrats in
each runoff plot (Zheng et al., 2008), and recording the dry weight
after drying to constant weight in an oven at 65 °C. The total litter fall
within one year in each forest ecosystem was used for calculation.
To examine ﬁne roots, soil cores were collected from a spot 20 cm in
diameter in each runoff plot by taking out soil cores, each 3.5 cm in di-
ameter in August 2016. The spots were so distributed as to represent
the upper, middle, and lower parts of each runoff plot, within which
the spots were located at random. Three soil samples were collected
from each spot. Thus, a total of 9 soil samples were obtained in each run-
off plot, giving a volume of each soil sample (V) in each part. Each soil
sample was passed through a 2 mm sieve and ﬁne roots (smaller than
2 mm in diameter) were separated from the soil, washed, dried to
constant weight at 65 °C, and weighed to determine the root mass
(M). The ﬁne roots in each forest ecosystem were measured once
since the longevity of ﬁne roots in the forest is about 1 year (Graefe
et al., 2008; Yuan and Chen, 2010) and the length of ﬁne roots in low al-
titude areas of tropical forests did not differ signiﬁcantly between
months (Graefe et al., 2008). Fine-root density (FRD) was calculated
from the volume and the mass(FRD = M/V)in the spot(Yu et al., 2016).
2.6. Hydrological service assessment
To measure the hydrological services, we constructed a standard
20 m × 5 m runoff plot to measure the surface runoff in each research
plot. The standard runoff plots has been widely used to monitoring
the hydrological services in forest ecosystems (Cao et al., 2008; Zheng
et al., 2008; Nunes et al., 2011), including tropical rainforest(Verbist
et al., 2010; Salemi et al., 2013) and plantations(Ferreira et al., 2016).
Each runoff plot was constructed with brick and measured a 20 cm
tall and 12 cm wide. The interior of the wall had a coat of waterproof
paint. The area enclosed was then back-ﬁlled with soil to achieve a uni-
form depth of 10 cm, leaving 10 cm of the wall exposed to delineate the
main body of the runoff plot. A square runoff pool (1.2 m × 1.2 m
× 1.2 m) was built on the downward slope below each runoff plot and
connected to it by a polyvinyl pipe 20 cm in diameter (Fig. 2).
Surface runoff was monitored for each rainfall event between Sep-
tember 2016 and August 2017. If the runoff pool collected enough
water, the quantity of runoff was determined by measuring the depth
of the water in the pool; if the amount of water collected in the pool
was too little to measure its depth accurately, the runoff was discharged
into a bucket for measuring. Surface runoff was measured for 6 events of
light rain, 8 of moderate rain, and 11 of heavy rain (see: 2.7 Precipitation
magnitude classiﬁcation).
Hydrological services were quantiﬁed basing on a runoff coefﬁcient
(RC) obtained by the following formula: RC = runoff/rainfall (Muñoz-
Villers and McDonnell, 2013).The runoff coefﬁcient represents the
water that ﬂows away after the rainfall in the ecosystem, so that the op-
posite of the runoff coefﬁcient (1-RC) indicates the water retained in the
ecosystems. As a type of regulating services, hydrological services refer
to the ability to retain water in ecosystems, as retain water can be
used for plant growth and groundwater replenishment (Zheng et al.,
2008; Muñoz-Villers and McDonnell, 2013). In this study, the character-
ization of hydrological services was represented using the quantity (1–
RC). Thus, the greater the value of (1–RC), the greater the capability to
provide hydrological service.
2.7. Precipitation magnitude classiﬁcation
To identify the impacts of extreme precipitation on the relationships
among plant functional traits, ecosystem properties, and hydrological
services, we divided rainfall into three types based on the amount of
total rainfall in 24 h in China's classiﬁcation (Ma et al., 2015): light
(b10 mm), moderate (10–25 mm), and heavy (N25 mm). We consid-
ered rainfall exceeding 3 mm at any one time a rainfall event, because
ﬁeld monitoring has shown that only rainfall N3 mm produces surface
runoff. We deployed a HOBO U30-NRC weather station (Onset, Cape
Cod, Massachusetts, USA) at each site to record meteorological data in-
cluding rainfall (accurate to 0. 2 mm). From September 2016 to August
2017, a total of 103 rainfall events were recorded in the study area, di-
vided into 46 events of light rain; 35, of moderate rain; and 22, of
heavy rain, with heavy rains contributing N64% of the total rainfall
(see details in Table S5).
2.8. Statistical analysis
We used Pearson correlation analysis to preliminarily investigate the
relationships between land-use intensity, CWMs, FD, ecosystem proper-
ties and hydrological services in three types rainfall (light, moderate,
586
Z. Wen et al. / Science of the Total Environment 682 (2019) 583–590

and heavy rain), as well as the correlations between CWMs, FD, ecosys-
tem properties and land-use intensity. Multi-model inference were con-
ducted for hydrological services and predictor variables by starting from
all 9 potential predictor variables under different rainfall types (Zhu
et al., 2015), land-use intensity as a ﬁxed variable, and 8 others as selec-
tion variables, resulting in a total of 255 possible models in each type of
rainfall. The process of multi-model inference allowed us to account for
multicollinearity between variables and to determine the most impor-
tant variables (Zhu et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2017). Pearson correlation
and multi-model inference analyses were completed with SAM 4.0
software.
From all subsets of analysis in multi-model inference, we selected
the variables retained in the best-ﬁt regression model with the lowest
Akaike Information Criterion (Zhu et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2017) for the
construction of Bayesian structural equation models (BSEMs). We
used the BSEM because it is more robust to small sample sizes and pro-
vides more reliable formal model comparison statistics (Assaf et al.,
2018). The BSEMs based on current knowledge of all predictor variables
relationships (Fig.1) and were initiated by including all possible rela-
tionships. The least signiﬁcant relationship was then removed stepwise
until the ﬁt of the model met requirements. We used several tests to as-
sess the model ﬁt of BSEMs, including the deviance information crite-
rion (DIC) and the posterior predictive P-value (PPp). The model with
the smallest DIC and a PPp approximately 0.50 indicates a plausible
model, whereas PPp closer to 0 or 1 indicates that the model is not plau-
sible (Dayer et al., 2016). The BSEMs were implemented using the
AMOS 21.0 software.
3. Results
Land-use intensity was signiﬁcantly correlated with functional traits,
including the second principal component of CWMs (CWM.PC2), func-
tional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), and ecosystem
properties, including canopy density, litter fall and ﬁne-root density
(Table 1), meaning that land-use intensity has a signiﬁcant impact on
multiple ecosystem structures. Land-use intensity had signiﬁcant effects
on hydrological services regardless of rainfall intensity (P b 0.05,
Table 1), as well as other variables except for the ﬁrst principal compo-
nent of CWMs (CWM.PC1) (Table 1), indicating multiple factors that
jointly regulate hydrological services.
The best ﬁve regression models by multi-model inference for each
rainfall types were presented and ranked according to the AICc
(Table 2). Most of these models exhibited high R-squared values, espe-
cially for moderate rainfall and heavy rainfall, which presented mini-
mum R-squared values of N50%, indicating signiﬁcant explanatory
power for variations in hydrological services. Speciﬁcally, all displayed
regression models included functional richness, canopy density, ﬁne-
root density (Table 2). For the optimal regression equation models
(with high weights), the explanatory variables included functional rich-
ness, canopy density and litter fall under light and moderate rains, how-
ever, the variable of the second principal component of CWMs (CWM.
PC2) was added in heavy rainfall (Table 2).
The ﬁnal Bayesian structural equation models showed that func-
tional traits and ecosystem properties could account for 46–65% of var-
iation of hydrological services under land-use intensity, their ability to
explain changes in hydrological services increases with rainfall intensity
(Fig.3). In addition to the direct effect of functional richness, there was
also an indirect effect on hydrological services through changes in can-
opy density and ﬁne-root density, however, none of CWM of traits had a
signiﬁcant direct or indirect effect on hydrological services in light and
moderate rainfall (Fig.3). In contrast, CWM.PC2 had a signiﬁcant effect
on hydrological services directly and indirectly by altering ﬁne-root
density and canopy density under heavy rain (Fig.3), but the impact in-
tensity of the CWM.PC2 was less than the functional richness (Fig.4).
Land use intensity showed the strongest total effect among all fac-
tors regardless of rainfall intensity, followed by functional richness
(Fig.4). Land-use intensity indirectly affects hydrological services
mainly through direct impact on functional richness (Fig.3, Fig.4), al-
though it also indirectly affects the hydrological services by altering can-
opy density and ﬁne-root density (Fig.3). In contrast, there was no
signiﬁcantly direct impact between land-use intensity and hydrological
services neglecting the type of rainfall (Fig.3).
4. Discussion
Land use change is one of the most important drivers of terrestrial
ecosystem services degradation (Chillo et al., 2018; Zheng et al.,
2019). Our study identiﬁes, through a predictive Bayesian structural
equation model parameterized with empirical data, direct and indirect
effects of land-use intensity on hydrological services and attempts to
tease out underlying mechanisms associated with plant functional ecol-
ogy and key ecological properties at a community scale. This work dif-
fers from the previous in that it revealed that changes to the plant
functional diversity were a key mechanism by which land-use intensity
indirectly affected hydrological services.

The results highlighted that functional diversity is more important
than CMW of the measured traits in regulating hydrological services,
differs from previous research related to hydrological services (Zheng
et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2016) and other ecosystem services, such as
soil erosion(Zhu et al., 2015) and carbon storage (Häger and Avalos,
2017). In the present study, functional richness, as measured the niche
space ﬁlled by the species within a community (Clark et al., 2012),
and functional diversity may reﬂect some form of ‘niche differences’
(Carroll et al., 2011). A greater functional diversity, that is higher values
and a wider range of functional traits, reﬂects not only the magnitude of
niche differences but also differences in resource utilization either
through space or time (Allan et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015), thereby lead-
ing to more pronounced effects on hydrological services.
We found that changes in functional diversity caused by land-use in-
tensity can indirectly affect hydrological services though key ecosystem
properties, including canopy density and ﬁne-root growth. This di-
verges from existing research related to hydrological services which
overlooked such indirect effects associated with functional diversity
(Cao et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2016), although some studies have
found this indirect effect in relation to soil fertility (Lundholm et al.,
2015), productivity (Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2017) and forage availabil-
ity (Chillo et al., 2018). We hypothesize that the mechanism of the indi-
rect effect on hydrological services is that community with higher
functional diversity promoted canopy density and ﬁne-root growth by
using light and soil nutrient resources more efﬁciently (Conti and
Díaz, 2013). Speciﬁcally, higher canopy density is expected to inter-
cept more rainfall and reduces the amount of precipitation reaching
the ground (Thompson et al., 2016), thereby reducing the potential
for runoff and erosion. Similarly, ﬁne-root density is one of the
most important root traits in a given ecosystem (Vannoppen et al.,
2015), and is also known to facilitate percolation by making the
soil more porous (Vannoppen et al., 2016), thereby improving hy-
drological services.
We observed that land-use intensity mainly affects hydrological ser-
vices indirectly by altering functional diversity, although ecosystem
properties also mediated indirect effects. This adds to our understanding
of how the increase in land-use change led to the degradation of terres-
trial ecosystem services. Previous studies have suggested that the change
in ecosystem properties, such as canopy density (Salemi et al., 2013), lit-
ter fall (Zheng et al., 2008), and ﬁne-root density (Vannoppen et al.,
2015), were the main reasons for the decline of hydrological services
caused by land-use change, but ignored the role of functional diversity.
In fact, functional diversity can affect hydrological services through two
different paths: directly and indirectly changing ecosystem properties,
and the direct effects are greater than the indirect.
The results of this work are novel and differ from the previous work
in that it revealed that environmental factors regulated the relationship
among land-use intensity, functional traits, and hydrological services.
This manifested in two ways. First, the functional trait-mediated impli-
cations of land-use intensity on hydrological services increased from
46% in light rain to 65% in heavy rain. Earlier research has pointed to a
similar relationship, in which the extent of variation in carbon storage
in tropical forests as explained by functional diversity increased after
adding soil factors (Lamarque et al., 2014). Second, only functional rich-
ness hold a signiﬁcant indirect effect on hydrological services in light
and moderate rainfall. In addition to functional richness, in contrast,
the CWM.PC2 also showed signiﬁcant indirect effects in heavy rain.
This demonstrates that rainfall magnitude or intensity plays an outsize
role in regulating the intrinsic path of the impact of functional traits
caused by land-use intensity on hydrological services. Considering the
rising trends in the frequency and magnitude of heavy rain events due
to global climate change (Donat et al., 2016; Schär et al., 2016), global
climate change may frequently and profoundly change the internal
pathway of land-use change impacts on hydrological services in the fu-
ture. However, environmental factors did not change the most critical
intrinsic pathways, as functional diversity was the most important fac-
tor in mediating the relationship between land-use intensity and hydro-
logical services regardless of rainfall intensity. Overall, land-use
intensity has a profound impact on the provision of hydrological ser-
vices, and the increase of extreme precipitation could signiﬁcantly and
noncritical affect the internal mechanism of degradation of hydrological
services caused by land-use intensity.

The results obtained important for managers to make land use strat-
egies in maintaining and improving ecosystem services, especially in
the background of large areas of natural forests have been transformed
into managed plantations in tropical regions (Muñoz-Villers and
McDonnell, 2013; Wen et al., 2017). Sustainable management should
aim at maintaining multiple categories of ecosystem services provision
(Allan et al., 2015; Häger and Avalos, 2017), and the consideration of
functional diversity helps in that way. Superﬁcially we ﬁnd that main-
taining high functional diversity in land management increases the po-
tential for hydrological services, as well as, potentially, other ecosystem
services (e.g., soil fertility and carbon storage) (Cadotte, 2017; Chillo
et al., 2018). Furthermore, functional diversity may also play an irreplace-
able role in combating the impact of global climate change (e.g., extreme
precipitation) on the supply of ecosystem services (Wright et al., 2015).
Therefore, monitoring functional diversity may be a useful tool to design
management strategies in face of continuing global environmental change.
5. Conclusions
By explicitly considering plant functional traits and ecosystem proper-
ties in relation to land-use intensity and ecosystem hydrological services,
we found that land-use intensity has signiﬁcant and indirect effects on hy-
drological services. The indirect effect on hydrological services, however,
mainly comes from land-use intensity induced changes in functional di-
versity, not CWM of traits and ecosystem properties. We also revealed
functional diversity caused by land-use intensity can indirect affect provi-
sion of hydrological services by changing ecosystem properties. However,
its direct effects were greater than indirect effects, indicating the main
mechanism of land-use intensity leading to hydrological service degrada-
tion is due to the reduction of the functional trait distribution among spe-
cies. Interestingly, we discovered that precipitation intensity can regulate
the relationships among land-use intensity, functional traits, ecosystem
properties and hydrological services, although the most important role
of functional diversity has not changed regardless of precipitation inten-
sity. Therefore, functional diversity has the potential to serve as an impor-
tant tool for sustaining hydrological services in response to key global
environmental change, precipitation intensity.

Abstract 
10 
Land surface models and dynamic global vegetation models typically represent 
11 
vegetation through coarse plant functional type groupings based on leaf form, phenology, and 
12 
bioclimatic limits. Although these groupings were both feasible and functional for early model 
13 
generations, in light of the pace at which our knowledge of functional ecology, ecosystem 
14 
demographics, and vegetation-climate feedbacks has advanced and the ever growing demand for 
15 
enhanced model performance, these groupings have become antiquated and are identified as a 
16 
key source of model uncertainty. The newest wave of model development is centered on shifting 
17 
the vegetation paradigm away from plant functional types (PFTs) and towards flexible trait-
18 
based representations. These models seek to improve errors in ecosystem fluxes that result from 
19 
information loss due to over-aggregation of dissimilar species into the same functional class. We 
20 
advocate the importance of the inclusion of plant hydraulic trait representation within the new 
21 
paradigm through a framework of the whole-plant hydraulic strategy. Plant hydraulic strategy is 
22 
known to play a critical role in the regulation of stomatal conductance and thus transpiration and 
23 
latent heat flux. It is typical that coexisting plants employ opposing hydraulic strategies, and 
24 
therefore have disparate patterns of water acquisition and use. Hydraulic traits are deterministic 
25 
of drought resilience, response to disturbance, and other demographic processes. The addition of 
26 
plant hydraulic properties in models may not only improve the simulation of carbon and water 
27 
fluxes but also vegetation population distributions.

The role of vegetation in the global land surface energy and water budgets 
29 
Feedbacks between vegetation, weather, and climate are critical to the function of the 
30 
Earth system (Pitman 2003; Bonan 2008; Quillet et al., 2010). Forested ecosystems provide a 
31 
carbon sink of 2.3-2.5 Pg-C yr-1 (Le Quere et al., 2013), while releasing ~62,000 km3 yr-1 water  
32 
to the atmosphere (Jasechko et al., 2013). Carbon uptake and transpirational water loss are 
33 
regulated dynamically through stomatal aperture, which, in many cases, is governed by water 
34 
status and plant hydraulic properties (Sperry 2000; Buckley 2005; Skelton et al., 2015). 
35 
Transpiration from plants has been shown to be the largest component of the terrestrial water 
36 
cycle and is an integral component of latent heat flux – the energy component that is expended 
37 
evaporating water (Schlesinger and Jasechko 2014). Changes to transpiration, and therefore 
38 
latent heat flux, affect the partitioning of the surface energy balance. Incoming solar radiation is 
39 
redistributed at the surface through different heat and radiative fluxes. Vegetation at the land 
40 
surface strongly affects this energy redistribution. As transpiration occurs, the surface of the leaf 
41 
cools due to the latent heat of vaporization, altering its long-wave emissivity through the Stefan-
42 
Boltzmann Law and thereby modifying the radiation budget (Strengers et al., 2010). 
43 
Alternatively, when stomata are closed, most of the incoming solar energy that is absorbed by 
44 
leaf surfaces turns into heat, which increases sensible heat flux to the atmosphere, and drives 
45 
stronger emissions of long-wave radiation. Root water uptake from different depths alters the 
46 
hydrologic cycle through changes in soil water content, groundwater availability, and 
47 
transpiration (Fatichi et al., 2016). Moisture recycling through transpiration is integral to the 
48 
rewetting of the boundary layer and continental precipitation patterns, particularly in tropical 
49 
regions (Hesslerova and Pokorny 2010; Lee and Boyce 2010; Aemisegger et al., 2014). 
50 
Transpiration has been also shown to drive cloud formation (de Arellano et al., 2014). 
51 
Furthermore, vegetation canopy structure and leaf area index (LAI) determine the fraction of 
52 
precipitation which is intercepted and evaporated, and that which reaches the soil as throughfall 
53 
(Peng et al., 2014). Canopy roughness exerts strong controls over boundary layer turbulence and 
54 
atmospheric mixing (Maurer et al., 2015). At a longer time scale, vegetation processes affect soil 
55 
development and biogeochemical processes (Chapin 2003). These and other vegetation-climate 
56 
feedbacks necessitate the inclusion of an adequate representation of vegetation dynamics within 
57 
hydrologic and climate models (Bonan et al., 2003).

PFTs and beyond 
60 
Land surface models (LSMs) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), typically 
61 
indicated as terrestrial biosphere models (e. g. Fisher et al., 2014), are types of models that 
62 
handle the surface energy budget for the atmospheric, hydrological, or combined Earth-system 
63 
models of which they are often a component. The land surface serves as the upper boundary for 
64 
hydrological models, and the lower boundary for weather and climate models. LSMs explicitly 
65 
resolve the effects of vegetation and its interactions with climate while representing the 
66 
vegetation as a static set of parameters. DGVMs likewise represent vegetation using static 
67 
parameters at the short time scales, but dynamically evolve the vegetative state over time 
68 
following plant ecological dynamics of establishment, growth, competition, and mortality. Both 
69 
types of models, and thus, most weather, climate, hydrology, and Earth system models which 
70 
employ them, generally cluster vegetation into groups on the basis of relatively few 
71 
characteristics such as aboveground live biomass permanence, leaf longevity, and leaf form 
72 
(Running et al., 1994). DGVMs and LSMs typically define plant functional types (PFTs) through 
73 
bioclimatic properties and static physical properties, such as plant height and leaf phenology 
74 
(Boulangeat et al., 2012; Pappas et al., 2016). These PFTs provide a basic and practical means of 
75 
classification for modeling of vegetation-climate interactions at large spatial and temporal scales 
76 
(Kucharik et al., 2006; Moorcroft 2006; Quillet et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2015). The use of PFTs 
77 
to model vegetation dynamics originated from the need to categorize plants by 
78 
‘ecophysiognomic traits’ into groups having similar structure and function (Box 1981; Box 1995; 
79 
Box 1996).  
80 
PFTs have since provided a feasible method for classification of global vegetation into a 
81 
small, finite number of clusters with assumed similar ecological behaviors on the basis of a 
82 
relatively small number of traits. Generally, models employ between 10 and 20 different PFTs, 
83 
with various combinations of these characteristics, to represent thousands plant species (Poulter 
84 
et al., 2011). However, specific models may use more or fewer PFTs depending on the intended 
85 
model application. For a global general circulation model, Box (1996) suggested 15 major plant 
86 
types. The current, broadly used Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5 (which is the LSM 
87 
component of NCAR's Earth system model – CESM) also relies on 15 basic PFTs (Table 1),

with additional crop functional types available under specific irrigation schemes or with a 
89 
particular crop sub-model (Lawrence et al., 2011; Oleson et al., 2013). Kleidon et al., (2007) 
90 
found that a minimum of eight discrete vegetation classes was required to prevent the formation 
91 
of multiple steady-states in the SimBA dynamic vegetation model. In contrast, Euskirchen et al., 
92 
(2009) chose to use 39 different PFTs to test predictions regarding the migration of arctic plant 
93 
communities under future climate scenarios using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model.  
94 
 
Global distributions of plant functional types are derived from remotely sensed land-
95 
cover data sets (DeFries et al., 1995; DeFries et al., 2000; Jung et al., 2006). Satellite data is used 
96 
to differentiate vegetation types in term of deciduousness, leaf form (needle or broad), and LAI 
97 
(Bonan et al., 2002; Moorcroft 2006; Quillet et al., 2010). The International Geosphere-
98 
Biosphere Programme (IGBP) developed the first broadly used map of land cover classes at a 1 
99 
km resolution from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Advanced 
100 
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1992-1993 dataset (Loveland et al., 2000) (Table 
101 
1). Recent reclassifications using newer satellite tools such as MODIS (1 and 0.5 km resolution), 
102 
SPOT4-VEGETATION (1 km), and ENVISTAT-MERIS (0.3 km) have improved the resolution 
103 
of these maps both spatially and temporally (Lawrence and Chase 2007; Poulter et al., 2011). 
104 
The 17 land cover classifications from the IGBP were developed in keeping with the logic of 
105 
Running et al., (1994) that plant classification should be independent of climate zone. Therefore, 
106 
the IGBP assessment of vegetative cover focused only on aspects of biomass permanence, leaf 
107 
longevity, and leaf type. Climatologic limits are imposed on PFTs through merger with Köppen-
108 
Geiger climate zones (Kottek et al., 2006; Peel et al., 2007; Poulter et al., 2011) or through the 
109 
prescription of ‘climate envelopes’ or temperature ranges where specific PFTs can exist (Sitch et 
110 
al., 2003). While these PFT distribution maps are widely accepted and heavily relied upon by 
111 
models, uncertainties still remain (Sun et al., 2008). For example, in a study using the LPJmL 
112 
model, Poulter et al., (2011) found that large uncertainties in key ecosystem fluxes, 30% of gross 
113 
primary productivity (GPP) and 20% of evapotranspiration, expressed as latent heat flux (LE), 
114 
resulted from land cover uncertainties.  
115 
 
 The heterogeneity of Earth’s vegetation and its critical role in mediating biosphere-
116 
atmosphere exchanges make it one of the largest sources of uncertainty in predictions of climate 
117 
change (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Moorcroft 2006; Denman and Brasseur 2007; Scheiter et al.,

2013; Wullschleger et al., 2014; Musavi et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Matthes et al., 2016). A 
119 
recent, large and still evolving body of work has drawn into question the capabilities of the 
120 
current plant classification scheme to accurately reflect the biodiversity of vegetative 
121 
ecophysiological functionalities. The coarse resolution at which PFTs are defined and vegetation 
122 
is resolved has been shown to lead to errors in simulations of carbon flux (Van Bodegom et al., 
123 
2012; Pavlick et al., 2013; Matthes et al., 2016), evapotranspiration (Poulter et al., 2011; 
124 
Matheny et al., 2014a; Matthes et al., 2016), and nitrogen cycling (Ostle et al., 2009). Current 
125 
PFTs define plant traits that govern these processes as static point estimates that lack the 
126 
flexibility to reflect any sort of inter- or intra-specific, spatial, or temporal variation or plasticity 
127 
(As discussed in Prentice et al., 2007; Van Bodegom et al., 2012; Scheiter et al., 2013; 
128 
Wullschleger et al., 2014). Reich et al., (2007) demonstrated that only 33-66% of the variability 
129 
of five key leaf functional traits of 2,021 species could be attributed to their PFT classification. 
130 
Likewise, Kattge et al., (2011) demonstrated that up to 75% of variation for certain traits 
131 
occurred within a given PFT. Recently, Wullschleger et al., (2014) ascertained that the plant 
132 
traits most useful in determining functional behaviors in terms of carbon, water, and nutrient use, 
133 
and therefore most relevant for determining more meaningful PFT groups, are plant size, 
134 
permanence of structure (woody vs. herbaceous), architecture (the ratio of water loss to carbon 
135 
uptake surface areas), leaf form, carbon metabolism (C3, C4, or CAM), reproduction, and 
136 
phenology. The assimilation of physiologically diverse species into the same PFT results in the 
137 
inability of current PFTs to capture variations between species’ carbon metabolisms and water 
138 
use efficiencies (WUE) (Reichstein et al., 2014; Musavi et al., 2015). This type of over-
139 
aggregation has been identified as a critical source of information loss, which may obfuscate 
140 
species-level traits and responses to environmental forcing and competition (Clark et al., 2011; 
141 
Scheiter et al., 2013; Matheny et al., 2014a). Frequently, competition dynamics are only resolved 
142 
between PFTs rather than between individuals comprising a functional group (As discussed in 
143 
Sato et al., 2007; Fisher et al., 2010; Quillet et al., 2010; Scheiter et al., 2013). Multiple studies 
144 
have shown that more variation can exist between the species comprising a single PFT than 
145 
among different PFTs (e. g. Wright et al., 2005; Anderegg 2015). However, encouraging results 
146 
from Bonan et al., (2012) demonstrated that by using observed trait values for maximum 
147 
carboxylation rate (Vcmax) with existing PFTs and a multilayer canopy structure, among other 
148 
improvements, they were able to increase the accuracy of GPP as predicted by CLM 4.

Furthermore, the inclusion of trait variation within PFT classifications by Verheijen et al., (2013) 
150 
enhanced the accuracy of predictions of carbon assimilation and vegetation distributions.  
151 
 
In keeping with these findings, the current sweeping challenge for DGVMs and LSMs is 
152 
to shift the PFT paradigm from its current representation of over-aggregated static parameters to 
153 
a more flexible trait-based classification scheme (Pavlick et al., 2013; Scheiter et al., 2013; 
154 
Fyllas et al., 2014; Reichstein et al., 2014; van Bodegom et al., 2014; Enquist et al., 2015; 
155 
Musavi et al., 2015; Sakschewski et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Pappas et al., 2016). Classically 
156 
defined PFTs are themselves based in plant traits, albeit a small number. However, this fact 
157 
creates a false dichotomy in terms of a naming convention. Following the distinction made by 
158 
Pappas et al., (2016), we refer to models that employ probabilistic representations of trait 
159 
diversity using stochastic approaches and coordinated whole-plant trait spectra as ‘trait-based’ in 
160 
contrast to those which employ the conventional PFT definitions.  
161 
Flexible trait-based representations, like the one put forward by Scheiter et al., (2013), 
162 
rely on ecological theory and environmental filtering to evolve a composition of various trait 
163 
combinations. In this review, we will focus specifically on the need for representation of plant 
164 
hydraulic traits within the context of reimagined PFTs and trait-based modeling schemes. The 
165 
integral role of transpiration from vegetation, as mediated through plant hydrodynamics, in both 
166 
the carbon cycle and the global energy budget, makes it a priority for model improvement 
167 
(Jasechko et al., 2013; Matheny et al., 2014a; Schlesinger and Jasechko 2014). However, impacts 
168 
and feedbacks on transpiration from predicted increases in the variability of precipitation and the 
169 
number of droughts and disturbances add complexity to this challenge (Allen et al., 2010; Dai 
170 
2013; Fatichi and Ivanov 2014). Baldocchi and Meyers (1998) showed that simulations of carbon 
171 
and water fluxes using the classic PFT definitions in CANVEG were only well adapted during 
172 
times of non-limiting soil moisture and dry leaves, and that additional parameterization was 
173 
necessary to capture the behaviors of water-stressed and water-logged scenarios. Missing 
174 
behaviors of water storage and transport within vegetation compartments (Baldocchi and Meyers 
175 
1998), and within-PFT variation in hydraulic traits (Anderegg 2015) makes current vegetation 
176 
schemes poorly suited to replicate the effects of drought on vegetation.  
177 
It is understood that traits such as relative growth rate, seed dispersal capacity, and 
178 
mortality are the primary determinants of demography (Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013; Yang et 
179

al., 2015). However, a number of hydraulic functional traits have also been shown to influence 
180 
establishment and mortality (Pockman and Sperry 2000; McDowell et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 
181 
2010; Anderegg and Meinzer 2015; Anderegg et al., 2016). For instance, run-away cavitation is a 
182 
common cause of mortality in seedlings (Williams et al., 1997; Pratt et al., 2014); ring porous 
183 
wood has been suggested to be an adaptation to resist damage to the conductive system during 
184 
freeze-thaw cycles (Taneda and Sperry 2008); and leaf hydraulic strategy has been hypothesized 
185 
to exert a strong influence on species’ ability to survive drought (McDowell et al., 2013; Bartlett 
186 
et al., 2014). The difference between a plant’s minimum xylem water potential and the potential 
187 
at which dysfunction occurs, defined as the hydraulic safety margin, has been related to mortality 
188 
risk during drought (Anderegg et al., 2016). This margin of hydraulic safety has also been shown 
189 
to correlate with regional precipitation predictability, while cavitation vulnerability has been 
190 
shown to correlate with species distributions along soil moisture gradients (Pockman and Sperry 
191 
2000). Li et al., (2015) demonstrated that the hydraulic properties of conductance and leaf water 
192 
potential were good indicators of species abundance. Wood density, another trait associated with 
193 
drought susceptibility (Hoffmann et al., 2011) as well as a number of additional plant hydraulic 
194 
properties (Pratt et al., 2007; Chave et al., 2009; Lachenbruch and McCulloh 2014; Anderegg 
195 
and Meinzer 2015), has been successfully employed by the current trait-based demographic 
196 
models TFS (Fyllas et al., 2014) and LPJmL-FIT (Sakschewski et al., 2015). 
197 
 
198 
Hydraulic functional traits and strategies 
199 
 
Functional traits are, by definition, those traits that exert strong influence over how an 
200 
organism performs in terms of growth, survival, and reproduction (McGill et al., 2006; Violle et 
201 
al., 2007). Hydraulic functional traits at the leaf, stem, and root levels determine a plant’s ability 
202 
to acquire, circulate, and use water. The whole-plant hydraulic strategy, which we define as the 
203 
syndrome of emergent phenotypical hydraulic functional traits that occur at all three levels (leaf, 
204 
stem, and root), is critical to understanding the timing and magnitude of transpiration fluxes and 
205 
species’ responses to drought and disturbance (Ford et al., 2007; McDowell et al., 2008; 
206 
Matheny et al., 2014b; von Allmen et al., 2014; Gaines et al., 2015). It is common for co-existing 
207 
species to employ contrasting whole-plant hydraulic strategies which result in distinct, species-
208 
specific patterns of transpiration and growth (e.g. McCulloh et al., 2012; Kocher et al., 2013; 
209 
Thomsen et al., 2013; Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014; Matheny et al., 2014b; Meinzer et al., 2014;

Anderegg 2015). In spite of these hydraulic differences, many standard PFT classifications group 
211 
such species into the same class. The incorporation of whole-plant hydraulic functional traits and 
212 
strategies into revised or expanded definitions of PFTs will improve model uncertainties due to 
213 
over-aggregation (Pappas et al., 2015). Coordination of hydraulic functional traits may occur 
214 
through tradeoffs defined within the plant economics spectrum (Wright et al., 2004; Chave et al., 
215 
2009; Freschet et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Freschet et al., 2012; Reich 2014) and potentially 
216 
through the proposed hydraulic safety-efficiency tradeoff (Manzoni et al., 2013; Skelton et al., 
217 
2015). However, recent work from Gleason et al., (2016) suggests that there may only be a weak 
218 
tradeoff between xylem safety and efficiency, evincing the large number of species that employ 
219 
combinations of low efficiency and low safety traits. It is possible that these traits may be trading 
220 
off with other, non-hydraulic traits in ways that are not yet clear (Gleason et al., 2016). 
221 
Nonetheless, nature presents a gamut of combinations of leaf, stem, and root hydraulic functional 
222 
traits. The following section will focus on the key emergent hydraulic traits at each of the three 
223 
organ levels summarized in Table 2.  
224 
 
225 
Leaf traits 
226 
At the leaf level, transpiration is dynamically regulated by the plant stomata as a response 
227 
to both internal and external conditions (Ball et al., 1987; Collatz et al., 1991; Tardieu 1993; 
228 
Leuning 1995). Stomatal conductance has been hypothesized to be optimized in order to 
229 
maximize the amount of carbon uptake while minimizing water loss (Cowan and Farquhar 1977; 
230 
Baldocchi 1994; Katul et al., 2010), yet in some circumstances, e.g. nocturnal transpiration 
231 
(Bucci et al., 2016), stomata appear to function in ways that are not driven by carbon uptake or 
232 
optimized for prevention of water loss. Two distinct schemes for the regulation of stomatal 
233 
conductance in response to leaf water potential are broadly recognized: (1) isohydry, a 
234 
cavitation-risk adverse strategy through which leaf water potential is maintained by strict control 
235 
of stomatal openness; (2) anisohydry, a cavitation-risk prone strategy through which high 
236 
stomatal openness is maintained via tolerance of highly negative leaf water potentials (Stocker 
237 
1956; Tardieu and Simonneau 1998; Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014), see illustration in Figure 1. 
238 
The majority of plants operate stomata along a range of regulation schemes on a virtual 
239 
continuum between these two extremes (Klein 2014). The degree of (an)isohydry is defined 
240 
through the curve describing the relationship between leaf water potential and stomatal

conductance (Figure 1). However, as this relationship is hard to measure, it is typically 
242 
determined through a comparison of either the extent of change between predawn- and midday-
243 
leaf water potential as a function of soil water potential (Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014), or the rate 
244 
of change in stomatal conductance between times when vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is low and 
245 
when VPD is high (Oren et al., 1999). However, it has recently been shown that the degree of 
246 
isohydricity can be determined through remotely sensed vegetative optical depth, a proxy for leaf 
247 
water potential, as measured from the AMSR-E satellite (Konings and Gentine 2016). 
248 
Differences between plants’ leaf hydraulic strategies are theorized to be of key importance in 
249 
determining species’ resilience to different types of drought (McDowell et al., 2008; Binks et al., 
250 
2016), although leaf traits alone may not provide a sufficiently complete picture of drought 
251 
mortality (Rowland et al., 2015).  
252 
Xylem traits 
253 
  
At the branch and stem levels, plants are typically classified on the basis of xylem 
254 
architectures: ring porous, having a small number of large-diameter xylem vessels; diffuse 
255 
porous, having a large number of small-diameter xylem vessels; and conifers (also referred to as 
256 
“non-porous” (Phillips et al., 1996; Oren et al., 1999)) which transport water through tracheids 
257 
rather than vessels. In addition to vessel diameter and number, hydraulic conductance is also a 
258 
function of several other interconnected traits such as vessel length, pit membrane flexibility and 
259 
size, aquaporin activity, ionic concentrations within the sap, and the ability to refill embolized 
260 
vessels, among others (Tognetti et al., 1998; Wagner et al., 1998; Tyree and Zimmermann 2002; 
261 
Brodribb and Holbrook 2006; Olano et al., 2013; Hacke 2014; Klein et al., 2014; Lachenbruch 
262 
and McCulloh 2014; Anderegg 2015). The xylem architecture and physiology determine the 
263 
functional relationships between xylem water potential and xylem conductivity (or loss thereof) 
264 
(Figure 2). Several studies have demonstrated that the large conduits of ring-porous species are 
265 
much more vulnerable to embolism than the smaller conduits employed by diffuse-porous trees 
266 
(Pockman and Sperry 2000; Li et al., 2008; Taneda and Sperry 2008), nonetheless, this is not 
267 
always the case (Sperry et al., 1994). Following the logic of the hypothesized safety-efficiency 
268 
tradeoff theory, it would be expected that trees having larger xylem vessels, which are generally 
269 
more conductive to water but also more vulnerable to cavitation, would tend to employ an 
270 
isohydric stomatal regulation strategy to avoid damage to the conductive system (Bovard et al., 
271

2005; Bush et al., 2008; Taneda and Sperry 2008). While xylem composed of smaller diameter 
272 
conduits would require less stringent stomatal regulation to maintain ‘safe’ levels of water 
273 
potential, they would be less conductive in ideally wet conditions. Even so, multiple examples of 
274 
anisohydric ring-porous species exist (Thomsen et al., 2013; Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014). Such 
275 
counter-intuitive combinations of hydraulic traits among organs may be mitigated by additional 
276 
traits or behaviors such as large capacitance for stem water storage, deep or efficient rooting 
277 
systems, and drought deciduousness (Brooks et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Kocher et al., 
278 
2013; Matheny et al., 2015). Therefore, for the purpose of modeling plant water dynamics, 
279 
importance should be placed on the emergent functional properties of xylem hydraulic 
280 
conductance and capacitance, rather than contributing traits.   
281 
Field-measured hydraulic conductances of ring and diffuse porous species have been 
282 
shown to be of comparable magnitudes during moisture-limiting conditions, which have caused 
283 
the largest, early-wood vessels of the ring porous species to cavitate (Hacke et al., 2006). In this 
284 
circumstance, the much smaller late-wood vessels of ring porous trees may act as an emergency 
285 
“high safety, low efficiency” back-up system (Sperry and Sullivan 1992; Woodcock 1994; 
286 
Taneda and Sperry 2008). This seasonality of conduit sizes within ring porous wood contributes 
287 
to the long-term temporal variability of hydraulic conductance, while the effects of diurnal 
288 
embolism are reflected in shorter-term declines of conductance (Sperry et al., 1993; Chuang et 
289 
al., 2006; Anderegg 2015). The timing and magnitude of hydraulic trait variability has been 
290 
shown to fluctuate by individual, life stage and history, population, species, and geographic 
291 
location (Anderegg 2015). Vulnerability to embolism may be a plastic trait and can also vary by 
292 
underlying genetic variability among individuals of the same species and population (Pockman 
293 
and Sperry 2000). Differences in conductance and embolism vulnerability within each organ 
294 
play a key role in the avoidance/tolerance of water stress (Tyree and Ewers 1991). The hydraulic 
295 
segmentation hypothesis of Tyree and Zimmermann (2002), through which a plant may sacrifice 
296 
distal organs (i.e. leaves and roots) or conductivity within distal organs in favor of protecting the 
297 
larger carbon and time investment of stem xylem from embolism, may provide one of the 
298 
mechanisms behind behaviors such as drought deciduousness and succulent root decoupling 
299 
from extremely dry soil (North and Nobel 1992; Pockman and Sperry 2000).

In addition to xylem conductance within the roots, the rhizosphere holds several other 
303 
contributing properties, which determine plant water acquisition and use. Such traits include 
304 
rooting depth and vertical distribution, root length and diameter distribution, efficiency of water 
305 
extraction, and mycorrhizal interactions (Canadell et al., 2007; Allen 2009; Reichstein et al., 
306 
2014; Wullschleger et al., 2014). Rooting depth is central to a plant’s ability to acquire water, 
307 
and deep roots have been shown to buffer plants with vulnerable leaf and stem strategies from 
308 
hydraulic impairment (Miller et al., 2010). While mesic tree species tend to root at depths 
309 
between 1 and 5 meters (Lyford and Wilson 1964; Lyford 1980; Canadell et al., 1996; Jackson et 
310 
al., 1996; He et al., 2013), extreme cases in more xeric environments have evidenced root depths 
311 
in excess of 20 meters (Jackson et al., 1999). Varied root depths within a single ecosystem allow 
312 
access to distinct water storage pools with differing seasonal availabilities. This type of ‘root 
313 
niche separation’ has been postulated to increase the ecosystem resilience of tropical forest to 
314 
drought in the Amazon (Ivanov et al., 2012). Brooks et al., (2010) demonstrated that the efficient 
315 
rooting systems of Douglas fir trees have the ability to extract ‘tightly bound’ water from clayey 
316 
soils, which enables them to persist in water limited regions. Other species’ ability to reverse 
317 
flow in portions of the root system allows for the hydraulic lifting of deeply stored water to 
318 
surface soil layers to supplement the available water pool for transpiration (Dawson 1993). 
319 
Hydraulic lift has been shown to contribute significantly to a tree’s subsequent day’s 
320 
transpiration (Horton and Hart 1998), and also to fuel processes of ecological significance such 
321 
as maintenance of mycorrhizal hyphae and fine roots (Neumann and Cardon 2012). Symbiotic 
322 
interactions with mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to increase plant-water availability by 
323 
acting as an extension of absorptive surface area (Ruiz-Lozano and Azcón 1995; Kaya et al., 
324 
2003). Yet these symbioses tend to be highly species specific and may be marginal in some cases 
325 
(Parniske 2008; Smith and Read 2008).  
326 
The below-ground nature of these traits makes them difficult to study or determine from 
327 
remote sensing, and therefore the majority of root system traits are underrepresented in the 
328 
literature as well as in trait databases (Kattge et al., 2011; Wullschleger et al., 2014). Freschet et 
329 
al., (2010) proposed that the plant economics spectrum may allow the inference of below-ground 
330 
traits from leaf and stem traits, although the authors note that the root traits were the least well-
331 
coordinated among organs. Taneda and Sperry (2008) noted that several genera of ring porous 
332 
trees tended to have deeper rooting systems (Nilsen et al., 1983; Burns and Honkala 1990; Miller 
333

et al., 2010). Similarly, Hoffmann et al., (2011) found that species having both dense wood and 
334 
anisohydric stomatal regulation were more likely to root at shallower depths. In keeping with the 
335 
theory of the coordination of hydraulic traits on a whole-plant scale, Franks et al., (2007) put 
336 
forward the concept of an ‘isohydrodynamic’ strategy, such that a virtually constant gradient of 
337 
water potential is maintained from roots to leaves in spite of the stomatal regulation strategy 
338 
(isohydric or anisohydric). Providing LSMs and DGVMs with a platform or basis for the 
339 
incorporation of these defining whole-tree hydraulic strategies or an integrated perspective of 
340 
emergent organ-specific hydraulic traits and their governing tradeoffs is a critical step forward in 
341 
reconsidering the PFT framework.  
342 
 
343 
Creating a framework for the incorporation of hydraulic traits 
344 
 
Inclusion of plant-trait observations at the tissue and organism scales into LSMs and 
345 
DGVMs will help improve our ability to simulate ecosystem responses to land use and climate 
346 
change (McIntyre and Lavorel 2007; Quillet et al., 2010; Boulangeat et al., 2012). Following the 
347 
framework of Reichstein et al., (2014) and Musavi et al., (2015), for each trait, which is 
348 
represented by the model as a parameter in a function, there exists a multi-dimensional 
349 
continuum of potential values, as demonstrated in Figure 2. While it is overly simplistic to 
350 
prescribe a single set of values to represent these traits, as is done by current PFT classifications, 
351 
it remains impractical to allow traits to vary across such a continuum (Figure 2), as there is no 
352 
feasible way to measure all variation at all scales between and within individuals, species, and 
353 
environments in time. Therefore, practical model applications must still employ some type of 
354 
binning for each trait with a measure of allowable variation within each bin. These bins will 
355 
include relatively similar species/sizes and/or growth stages. In order for this type of binning 
356 
scheme to improve upon the current PFT system, bins must be established at a level across which 
357 
hydraulic traits are conserved. Scaling up from the bin level to the plot and ecosystem levels 
358 
could be done by weighting species’ properties within each bin by their relative abundance 
359 
and/or leaf area index (LAI) in a bottom up approach (Musavi et al., 2015) in order to aggregate 
360 
traits themselves to the top level. This approach combines the efficiency and practicality of the 
361 
original PFT classification system while providing the biophysical observational grounding and 
362 
flexibility that was lacking in the previous methodology.

The multiscale time dependence of hydraulic traits, and by extension the emergent 
364 
ecosystem-level 
water-use 
efficiency, 
highlights 
the 
requirement 
that 
trait-based 
365 
parameterizations should be flexible rather than fixed, as is the case with the current PFT 
366 
scheme. This type of adaptability will be a critical advantage for the next generation of DGVMs 
367 
and LSMs (Poulter et al., 2011; Van Bodegom et al., 2012; Scheiter et al., 2013). As discussed in 
368 
the previous sections, hydraulic conductivity within an individual organism changes at both the 
369 
fast (intra-daily) and slow (monthly, seasonal, and annual) time scales (Hacke 2014; Trifilo et al., 
370 
2014). Surmounting these challenges may still require use of a second proposed methodology: 
371 
the incorporation of mechanistic process-based models (e.g.  FETCH (Bohrer et al., 2005; 
372 
Mirfenderesgi et al., 2016), ExpertN (Janott et al., 2011; Bittner et al., 2012), SPAC (Gentine et 
373 
al., 2015), root model described by Siqueira et al., (2008)), in order to capture dynamic responses 
374 
to these traits, which are expressed as variable parameters (Powell et al., 2013). These process-
375 
based plant hydraulics models simulate water flow through part or all of the plant vascular 
376 
system, using the Richards equation (Bohrer et al., 2005; Siqueira et al., 2008; Janott et al., 2011) 
377 
or Darcy’s law (Gentine et al., 2015) for porous media flow. In this type of framework, traits 
378 
such as hydraulic conductance and, in some models, capacitance are determined at relatively 
379 
short time steps (e.g. 1-30 min) as functions of water pressures within the plant vascular system. 
380 
Other traits, such as wood density and leaf area index can be adjusted or allowed to vary at 
381 
longer, i.e. annual or seasonal, time scales. These vegetation hydrodynamics sub-models have 
382 
the potential to operate at the bin-level and calculate vegetation soil water withdrawal, stomatal 
383 
conductance, and transpiration mechanistically on the basis of the whole-plant hydraulic 
384 
strategy. These model outputs could then be statistically scaled to the patch- or ecosystem-level 
385 
on the basis of leaf or basal area or other similar metrics following Matheny et al., (2014b).  
386 
 
Trait similarities such as the standard/typical shape of cavitation vulnerability curves 
387 
(Figure 2) across ring porous tree species (Sperry and Saliendra 1994; Hacke et al., 2006; Taneda 
388 
and Sperry 2008), and trait relationships, such as that between WUE and cellulose carbon isotope 
389 
composition (Farquhar and Richards 1984; Werner et al., 2012), will help constrain the 
390 
potentially infinite new parameter spaces. Furthermore, the increasing wealth of species- and 
391 
leaf-level trait data across broad spatial scales will help to facilitate this transition to trait based 
392 
modeling. Large repositories of trait data such as the BIEN database (Enquist et al., 2009), the 
393 
xylem water potential database (Choat et al., 2012), the wood density database (Chave et al.,

2009), the vessel anatomy database (Zanne et al., 2010), the leaf turgor loss point database 
395 
(Bartlett et al., 2012; Bartlett et al., 2014; Maréchaux et al., 2016), the GLOPNET leaf trait 
396 
database (Wright et al., 2004; Reich et al., 2007), the GlobResp leaf respiration database (Atkin 
397 
et al., 2015), the light response database of Niinemets et al., (2015), and the herbivory 
398 
defense/response database (Moles et al., 2013) have recently been established. Many of these 
399 
data resources are available through the TRY global plant trait database (Kattge et al., 2011). 
400 
These archives, when used in tandem with the mathematical and statistical advancements of 
401 
model-data fusion techniques (Wang et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2011; Keenan et al., 2012; Dietze 
402 
et al., 2013), will provide modelers with physically realistic distributions of trait possibilities and 
403 
combinations for use in regional and global scale simulations.  
404 
In an effort to help characterize and quantify trait variability (temporally, spatially, and 
405 
intra- and inter-specifically) and its empirical and functional relationships with environmental 
406 
conditions for use in modeling scenarios, special emphasis should be placed on expanding the 
407 
measurement record across temporal scales and maintaining the integrity of metadata provided 
408 
for traits recorded in these and other databases. At present, most trait measurements are carried 
409 
out as snapshots during relatively few growing seasons. A more complete temporal record will 
410 
enhance our understanding of trait variability with time. Metadata of interest may include the 
411 
tissue/organ on which the measurement was made, the number of individuals sampled and the 
412 
variation between individuals, time of year/season, geographic location, mean annual or seasonal 
413 
meteorological variables (e.g. incoming solar radiation, temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil 
414 
moisture), and other data of interest surrounding the measurement such as if the year/season was 
415 
exceptionally dry or hot, or if a specific pest or blight was present. Currently, only some of the 
416 
trait databases provide some of the metadata needed for forming a predictive description of trait 
417 
variability across ecosystems and climate.

426 
al., 2013; Matheny et al., 2014a). While trait-based models will not provide solutions for all 
427 
scenarios, specifically those involving insect attack (Kurz et al., 2008; Herms and McCullough 
428 
2014; Anderegg et al., 2015) or grazing (Yu et al., 2011; Wullschleger et al., 2014), they do 
429 
provide a necessary step forward in simulating carbon and water fluxes (Scheiter et al., 2013; 
430 
Reichstein et al., 2014; Pappas et al., 2016). DGVMs and LSMs using standard PFTs and climate 
431 
envelopes have been criticized for their lack of ability to accurately represent the mechanisms for 
432 
species coexistence and biodiversity (McMahon et al., 2011; Boulangeat et al., 2012). However, 
433 
the recent incorporation of plant traits and coexistence mechanisms into DGVMs and, more 
434 
specifically, demographic models which give additional focus to the incorporation of processes 
435 
such as recruitment, growth, and mortality of vegetation, provides a feasible avenue for this 
436 
advancement as demonstrated by aDGVM2 (Scheiter et al., 2013), JeDi (Pavlick et al., 2013), 
437 
CLM-ED (Fisher et al., 2015), LPJmL-FIT (Sakschewski et al., 2015), and LM3-PPA (Weng et 
438 
al., 2015).  
439 
 
Within trait-based DGVMs and demographic models, ecosystem properties serve to 
440 
‘filter’ plants with different suites of traits to select for species or hypothetical proxy species 
441 
most fit for that environment (Sterck et al., 2011; Fisher et al., 2015). These models may be able 
442 
to more closely reflect trait diversity, species co-existence, and ecosystem productivity than 
443 
previous generations of DGVMs (Fisher et al., 2015). Driving model demographics with plant 
444 
traits may promote an improved understanding of trait- and bio-diversity, interactions between 
445 
biotic and abiotic factors, and their influence on ecosystem function (Loreau et al., 2001; Hooper 
446 
et al., 2005; Cadotte et al., 2009). Paleoclimatological studies reveal that vegetation responses to 
447 
past climate shifts have resulted from a combination of species competition and migration 
448 
(Thuiller et al., 2008; Huntley et al., 2010; Quillet et al., 2010). As warming continues and 
449 
bioclimatic limits shift (Box 1981; Harrison et al., 2010), trait-based demographic models will be 
450 
better suited to replicate future species distributions and abundances without the need for pre-
451 
parameterized climate envelopes (Fisher et al., 2015).  
452 
 
Plant functional traits, both hydraulic and otherwise, are responsible for feedbacks 
453 
between reproduction, growth, and success (Sterck et al., 2011). Therefore, trait-based models 
454 
must account for tradeoffs among traits (as reviewed in Scheiter et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2015) 
455 
to prevent one or two unrealistic ‘overly optimal’ cohort species, or Darwinian demons (Law

1979), from out- competing all others (Scheiter et al., 2013). Angert et al., (2009) demonstrated 
457 
that tradeoffs between relative growth rate and intrinsic WUE are strong influencers of 
458 
demographic response in desert species typically classified within the same traditional PFT. 
459 
Tradeoffs between specific traits within the hydraulic system (e.g. storage versus strength, and 
460 
conductance versus hydraulic safety) have been directly related to plant height, growth, and 
461 
survival among various co-existing rainforest species (Poorter et al., 2010). While biological 
462 
mechanisms for coexistence and community assembly have been well studied (e.g. Chesson 
463 
2000; Clark et al., 2010), using trait tradeoffs as a means to simulate coexistence and biodiversity 
464 
in models is still a challenge area. Some key tradeoff surfaces may not be readily apparent or 
465 
easily studied (Fisher et al., 2015), while others may not be ubiquitous (Moncrieff et al., 2015). 
466 
Missing relevant tradeoffs may leave models unable to explain particular patterns of species 
467 
distributions with respect to available resources (Sterck et al., 2011). The continued study and 
468 
development of a global, whole-plant economics spectrum is integral for the advancement of trait 
469 
and tradeoff-based demographic models (Reich 2014). Within this context, the ability to account 
470 
for intra- and inter-specific trait variation and adaptation will be essential (Messier et al., 2010; 
471 
Albert 2015; Anderegg 2015). Currently, trait parameterization schemes assume that both traits 
472 
and tradeoffs will continue to be valid under future climate scenarios (Clark and Gelfand 2006). 
473 
However, the synthesis efforts of Franks et al., (2014) reveal that both genetic adaptation and 
474 
phenotypic plasticity are presently occurring within plant communities. Many of the present trait 
475 
based models also show a strong dependence on the initial parameterization or the starting 
476 
composition of an ecosystem, which is a representation of the consequences of past disturbances 
477 
and management histories on the ecosystem. Therefore, another key challenge for the use of 
478 
these models in the prediction of future ecosystems will be the use of smart initialization 
479 
methods and adequate maps of current plant trait distributions. Nonetheless, the adaptive trait 
480 
selection methodology developed and employed by aDGVM2  (Scheiter et al., 2013) may lay the 
481 
foundation for future model structures to account for trait variability.

Conclusions - A path forward 
484 
 
As we demonstrate above, current PFT classifications, which represent thousands of plant 
485 
species on the basis of relatively few, assumed-static parameters, have been identified as a 
486 
critical source of uncertainty in land surface and dynamic global vegetation models (Reich et al.,

2007; Wullschleger et al., 2014; Musavi et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015). Model characterizations 
488 
of vegetation affect simulations of the surface energy balance and the carbon, water, and nitrogen 
489 
cycles (Ostle et al., 2009; Matheny et al., 2014a; Matthes et al., 2016). Plant hydraulic traits are 
490 
integral to the regulation of transpiration and growth through controls on root water uptake and 
491 
stomatal conductance (Anderegg and Meinzer 2015). Traits at the root, stem, and leaf levels 
492 
interact to define the syndrome of emergent phenotypical hydraulic traits we term the whole-
493 
plant hydraulic strategy. The incorporation of whole-plant hydraulic strategy into new trait-based 
494 
representations of vegetation in models will serve to improve simulations of carbon and water 
495 
fluxes, particularly in cases of drought and disturbance (McDowell et al., 2013; Matheny et al., 
496 
2014b). Whole-plant hydraulic strategy has the potential to be incorporated into models in 
497 
several ways with varying degrees of complexity and computational load.  
498 
Here, we presented two alternatives: The first alternative centers on the integration of 
499 
whole-plant hydraulic strategies into bins of similar properties through the use of combined leaf-
500 
xylem-root hydrology strategies. Conceptually, this calls for expanding the current PFTs to 
501 
include the combination of hydraulic strategies as defining properties for each bin of species. 
502 
However, this approach may also suffer problems similar to those associated with over-
503 
aggregation found within existing PFT paradigms. The second approach for the incorporation of 
504 
whole-plant hydraulic strategy requires the use of mechanistic plant hydrodynamic sub-models 
505 
to simulate the functional behaviors of statistically scalable representative individuals. While this 
506 
method provides greater opportunity to capture behaviors resulting from long- and short-term 
507 
trait variability, it will require additional computational resources.  
508 
Both proposed incorporation schemes present ways by which observational plant trait 
509 
data from newly established databanks can be utilized to inform practical model 
510 
parameterizations grounded in reality. Models incorporating trait-based representations of plant 
511 
hydraulic properties may be better able to capture demographic responses to climate change if 
512 
modelers and ecologists can successfully identify the appropriate tradeoff surfaces within the 
513 
plant economics spectrum (e. g. Chave et al., 2009). To test the potential for model 
514 
improvements through the incorporation of the whole-plant hydraulic strategy and its practical 
515 
applicability at multiple temporal and spatial scales, modelers should seek to include the 
516 
discussed as well as other strategies within a board variety of trait-based land surface and

within the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2) to replicate vegetation dynamics in a

isohydric (blue) stomatal regulation and leaf water potential. β represents the fraction of actual 
1248 
stomatal conductance, as a proportion of the reference stomatal conductance when soil moisture 
1249 
and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are non-limiting for transpiration. Lines represent idealized

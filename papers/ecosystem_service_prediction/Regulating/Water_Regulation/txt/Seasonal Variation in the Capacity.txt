ABSTRACT
There is a need for accurate predictions of ecosystem
carbon (C) and water ﬂuxes in ﬁeld conditions.
Previous research has shown that ecosystem prop-
erties can be predicted from community abundance-
weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits
and measures of trait variability within a community
(FDvar). The capacity for traits to predict carbon (C)
and water ﬂuxes, and the seasonal dependency of
these trait-function relationships has not been fully
explored. Here we measured daytime C and water
ﬂuxes over four seasons in grasslands of a range of
successional ages in southern England. In a model
selection procedure, we related these ﬂuxes to
environmental covariates and plant biomass mea-
sures before adding CWM and FDvar plant trait
measures that were scaled up from measures of
individual plants grown in greenhouse conditions.
Models describing ﬂuxes in periods of low biological
activity contained few predictors, which were usu-
ally abiotic factors. In more biologically active peri-
ods, models contained more predictors, including
plant trait measures. Field-based plant biomass
measures were generally better predictors of ﬂuxes
than CWM and FDvar traits. However, when these
measures were used in combination traits accounted
for additional variation. Where traits were signiﬁ-
cant predictors their identity often reﬂected seasonal
vegetation dynamics. These results suggest that
database derived trait measures can improve the
prediction of ecosystem C and water ﬂuxes. Con-
trolled studies and those involving more detailed
ﬂux measurements are required to validate and ex-
plore these ﬁndings, a worthwhile effort given the
potential for using simple vegetation measures to
help predict landscape-scale ﬂuxes.

INTRODUCTION
There is increasing interest in predicting ecosystem
functions (for example, carbon (C) and water
ﬂuxes) and quantifying the contribution of biodi-
versity to these in both natural and semi-natural
ecosystems (Diaz and others 2007; Schumacher
and Roscher 2009; Sapijanskas and Loreau 2010;

Lavorel and others 2011; Verheijen and others
2013). Unfortunately, direct measurements of eco-
system function often require specialist techniques
and equipment, making them time consuming and
costly (Sala and others 2000). Therefore, some au-
thors have suggested that functional traits could be
substituted for direct measurements of function
(Garnier and others 2004). This could be advanta-
geous because plant community composition is
simple to quantify (for example, in quadrat surveys)
and strongly inﬂuences ecosystem functioning (for
example, by controlling photosynthesis, respiration
and decomposition) (Diaz and others 2007).
To date, the most widely used approach to link
traits to ecosystem function is to ﬁrst select plant
traits that are closely linked with the ecosystem
processes of interest (effects traits, sensu Lavorel
and Garnier 2002). Next, trait values are assigned to
each species in a community and a weighted aver-
age is calculated using species abundances as
weights. This is known as a ‘‘community weighted
mean’’ (CWM) (Garnier and others 2004; Diaz and
others 2007). CWMs are based upon the principle
that a species’ contribution to ecosystem function is
proportional to its biomass, a concept known as the
biomass ratio hypothesis (Grime 1998). An addi-
tional component of plant community composition
that may inﬂuence ecosystem function is the
functional diversity and variation of traits, one
measure of which is FDvar (Mason and others
2003), a constrained value that describes the pro-
portion of variation of a single trait within a com-
munity. It is calculated as the variance in traits,
weighted by species abundances. The support for
such a measure as a predictor of ﬂuxes comes from
numerous experimental studies. These have dem-
onstrated that complementary resource use by plant
species in diverse mixtures results in higher primary
productivity (Hector and others 1999; Cardinale
and others 2006; Cardinale and others 2007). It was
also shown that functional trait diversity within a
community, such as in plant height, leaf structure
or root to shoot ratio, may increase community light
use efﬁciency (Vojtech and others 2008). The
diversity of plant functional trait values has also
explained the greater C ﬂuxes of more species
communities in experimental mesocosms (Milcu
and others 2014). However, the importance of this
relationship in natural ﬁeld conditions, in which
other environmental drivers of ecosystem function
vary strongly, remains in question.
Most studies that have attempted to link species
or functional trait diversity to function in natural
conditions have found the relationship to be weak
or absent (Diaz and others 2007; Grace and others
2007; Schumacher and Roscher 2009; Laughlin
2011). In contrast, CWMs tend to be reasonable
predictors of function in observational studies.
When combined with abiotic predictors CWMs can
account for up to approximately 70% of the vari-
ation in ecosystem properties, such as biomass
production (Lavorel and others 2011), nitrogen
availability (Diaz and others 2007), soil bacterial
biomass (de Vries and others 2012) and soil C
stocks (Garnier and others 2004). To date these
studies have focussed on integrated or snapshot
measures of ecosystem properties. The capacity of
functional markers to explain gas and water ﬂuxes
from ecosystems has received less attention, despite
indications that the traits and diversity of plant
communities can affect ecosystem CO2 and water
ﬂuxes (Craine and others 2001a, b; Johnson and
others 2008; Kunert and others 2012; Michel and
others 2012; Verheijen and others 2013). Although
previous empirical studies have suggested that
functional
trait
measures
could
improve
our
capacity to predict ﬂuxes, these typically relate time
series C-ﬂux data from a single ﬂux tower to
changes in few traits across time (Hui and others
2003; Ma and others 2011). The capacity of trait
variation to explain ﬂuxes across wider ranges of
environmental conditions is unknown.
Several other questions must ﬁrst be addressed if
traits are to be used to predict ﬂuxes: which traits
are the best predictors of which ﬂuxes, and are the
identity of the best predictor traits consistent over
time? It is likely for example that different traits
explain
different
physiological
processes,
for
example, photosynthetic efﬁciency traits will con-
trol CO2 uptake and others, like leaf tissue chem-
istry, will control decomposition rates (De Deyn
and others 2008). Because growth, respiration and
decomposition vary in their relative importance
across the year, then the identity of trait–ﬂux
relationships may also vary seasonally (Eviner and
others 2006). However, a strong correlation be-
tween tissue physiology and chemistry may mean
that some traits, for example, speciﬁc leaf area
(SLA), predict ﬂuxes in both growth and decom-
position periods (Wright and others 2004). Another
important consideration is whether trait measures
make signiﬁcant improvements to model predic-
tions; how useful are trait measures compared to
measures of standing plant biomass and abiotic
drivers, such as soil moisture, temperature and
light availability, and can they explain additional
variation on top of these factors?
In this study, we aimed to address these ques-
tions, with a particular focus on investigating the
seasonal dependency of trait–function relationships
G. Everwand and others

in grassland ecosystems. As a principal goal of the
study was to assess whether database and other ex-
situ trait measures are of practical use in predicting
ecosystem
function,
glasshouse-derived
species
trait measures were used to generate CWM and
FDvar values rather than in situ ﬁeld-derived
measures. The latter are more likely to accurately
represent ﬁeld trait expression but are not practical
in ecosystem survey and monitoring (Mokany and
Ash 2008; Cordlandwehr and others 2013). We
conducted this investigation by setting up ﬁxed
sampling rings on grasslands of varying succes-
sional age in which we measured plant species
composition, environmental covariates and C and
water ﬂuxes. Composition measurements were
combined with measures of functional trait mea-
sures to generate CWM and FDvar metrics and
these were used alongside the environmental
covariate data to build statistical models describing
ﬂuxes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sites
The study was conducted in the successional
mesotrophic grasslands of Silwood Park, Berkshire,
in
south
east
England
(lat.
51.406371,
long.
-0.648648). The ﬁve selected sites were ﬂat,
within 1 km of each other (Appendix A in Elec-
tronic Supplementary Material) and were all based
upon a nutrient poor and weakly acidic sandy loam
soil based upon Tertiary sandstone, the Bagshot
beds. These soils have a low phosphorus sorption
capacity (Manning and others 2006) and nutrient
concentrations are typically 1.6–3.6 mg dissolved
inorganic N kg-1 and 2–4 mg extractable P kg-1
(see Table S1, Milcu and others 2011; Fry and
others 2013 for details). Community composition
varied greatly between the sites and seasons with
successional age being the likely dominant cause of
these differences. Two sites were recently ploughed
in December 2008. The other three sites were in
later successional states (approximately 20, 75 and
165 months since ploughing) but all lacked woody
plants. Communities can be summarised as forming
a successional gradient from the OV10 type of the
UK National Vegetation Classiﬁcation (Rodwell
1992) after disturbance to various variants of the
MG6, U1 and MG1 types later in succession (see
Crawley 2005 for a detailed ecology of the site). In
some areas herbivores, particularly rabbits (Oryc-
tolagus cuniculus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
graze and browse and due to this and recent
ploughing some sites had a low standing biomass
(Figure 1). Vegetation of the ﬁve sampling areas is
described in further detail in Tables S2, S3 and S4
and Appendix A in Electronic Supplementary
Material. A full list of the 66 species found in the
study can be found in Table S3.
Plot Layout and Flux Measurements
Within each of the ﬁve sites, six 1 m2 plots were
established. In each we installed two ﬁxed rings of
200 mm diameter PVC pipe, each 200 mm from
the centre of the plot along a diagonal axis. The
PVC ring was buried 50 mm belowground and
protruded 50 mm aboveground to provide a collar
for an air-tight seal when taking passive measure-
ments in a closed system connected to a CIRAS 2
Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA) (PP Systems, Hitchin,
UK).
Rings were buried in December 2008, 4 months
prior to the start of the measurements to mini-
mise soil disturbance effects and to allow roots
time to recover. This combination of ﬁve sites
with six plots within each, and two rings in each
plot gave a total of 30 replicates for plot level
measures and 60 for ring level measures. From
each ring single measures of net ecosystem CO2
exchange (NEE), evapotranspiration and ecosys-
tem respiration were taken in four different time
periods: 19th March–1st April 2009 (early spring,
hereafter March), 29th May–4th June 2009 (an
active growth period, hereafter June), 3rd–6th
August shortly after peak biomass (hereafter Au-
gust) and the 3–6th November 2009 (the autumn
senescence
phase,
hereafter
November).
Mea-
surements were taken between 11:30 and 13:30
GMT over 3–10 days, in dry conditions when
cloud
cover was intermediate in density and
unbroken. When measuring NEE, the net balance
between photosynthetic uptake and soil and plant
respiration, the measurement chamber was placed
on the ring for 4 min and the ﬂux was deter-
mined from the change in CO2 concentration. To
measure total ecosystem respiration, we covered
the chamber with an aluminium-coated sheet to
exclude light and prevent heat absorbance (Kolari
and others 2006) and another 4 min measure-
ment was taken. Gross photosynthesis was esti-
mated as total ecosystem respiration subtracted
from NEE. Several abiotic covariates were also
recorded
during
each
CO2
ﬂux
measurement
(Wagner and others 2009): six measures of pho-
tosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (400–700 nm)
were taken using a PAR metre (Skye Instruments,
Llandrindod Wells, Wales); soil moisture measures
Trait–Flux Relationships

were taken using a Theta probe (Delta-T Devices
Ltd, Cambridge, UK); and for soil temperature, a
Checktemp Soil Thermometer (Hanna HI Instru-
ments,
Michigan,
USA)
was
used.
For
these
moisture and temperature measures, three mea-
surements were taken around the ring and aver-
aged. In each ring, the percentage cover of all
higher plant species was recorded in the week
after ﬂux measures were taken. Mosses were not
recorded to species level. For more details on ﬂux
measurement see Appendix B in Electronic Sup-
plementary Material.
Cover–Biomass Calibration and Plant
Traits
To predict plant biomass non-destructively, we
measured plant cover and biomass in plots adjacent
to the study plots and used these to build calibra-
tion models that predict aboveground biomass from
our cover measures. Separate models were con-
structed for grasses, mosses and herbs as they dif-
fered strongly in their biomass per unit cover (for
details see Appendix B and Table S5 in Electronic
Supplementary Material).

G. Everwand and others

For trait measures, 65 species of the local ﬂora
were germinated on seedling compost (John Innes
no. 1) in 19 ± 1C glasshouses with 8/16-h photo-
period. Then, in January 2008, ﬁve individuals of
each species with a height of approximately 3 cm
were transferred into a single tube each (60 cm deep,
12 cm diameter). Seed was sourced commercially,
but of local origin (Herbiseed, Twyford, England).
The tubes contained soil from a grassland within our
study area and were covered with mesh at the bot-
tom. See Table S1’s mature grassland column and
the control conditions of the mid-successional site of
Milcu and others (2011) for soil properties. Plants
were then grown in conditions described above and
watered when required. These conditions were
representative in photoperiod and temperature to
the ﬁeld sampling periods of June and August (16 h,
20C Figure 1E) but much warmer than in the
March and November periods. Trait measures may
therefore be more representative for the summer
sampling periods. After 90 days, or at ﬂowering for
short-lived species, we took ﬂux measures on the
plants and harvested them. For ﬂux measures, we
used a Ciras-1 IRGA (PP Systems, Hitchin, UK), with
an Integrated cuvette air supply unit and standard-
ised light emitting diode, to measure the photosyn-
thesis (lmol m-2 s-1), transpiration (mmol m-2 s-1)
and stomatal conductance (mmol m-2 s-1) of a
healthy leaf, on each plant. Measurements were
taken between 10:00 and 15:00 h in full sunlight.
After ﬂux measures were taken, plant height was
measured and plants were harvested. We measured
photosynthetic surface area (PSA) of all above-
ground plant organs using a scanner and the Leaf
Area program (Version 1.3., University of Shef-
ﬁeld). After drying for 48 h at 60C, we measured
aboveground biomass (AGB) (g) and belowground
biomass (BGB) (g), the latter obtained by washing
roots over a 1-mm sieve. Root–shoot ratio was
calculated from AGB and BGB. We calculated
speciﬁc leaf area by dividing PSA by AGB. This
method can be viewed as speciﬁc plant area and
was used as many of the species were sprawling
herbs with very small leaves and green stems.
Relative growth rate (g g-1 d-1) was calculated
from total biomass of 2-week-old seedlings and that
at harvest. Aboveground biomass C, N and P (all in
mg kg-1) and C/N ratio were measured according
to
standard
procedures
(ball
milling,
Kjedahl
digestion and colorimetric analysis). This entire
process was repeated in January 2009 with a new
set of ﬁve plants of each species and with soil taken
from the same site. This resulted in ten measures
for each trait, for each species, which was then
averaged to give a species value. A full list of species
and their trait values is given in Tables S3a–f.
Species trait data were used to determine CWM
trait values for each ring, with the weights being
the proportion of estimated biomass for each spe-
cies within the community (For formula, see
Appendix B in Electronic Supplementary Material).
Functional diversity of trait values, represented by
functional divergence (FDvar) (Mason and others
2003), was also calculated for each plot (for for-
mula, see Appendix B in Electronic Supplementary
Material). Only higher plants were used to calcu-
late CWM and FDvar values. These calculations
were performed using the R package F-diversity
(Casanoves and others 2010).

and others (2007). This procedure adds terms
according to a hypothetical hierarchy of controls,
starting with abiotic drivers of function before
adding terms describing species composition and
trait distribution. In all cases, mixed-effects models
were ﬁtted using maximum likelihood with the
lme function of R version 2.11.1 (R-Development-
Core-Team 2010) and a ring-within-site random
effects structure. Separate models were ﬁtted for
each time period and function totalling 12 models
(Tables 1, 2, 3). An exponential variance term was
included if it signiﬁcantly improved model likeli-
hood (August respiration and photosynthesis, and
March and November evapotransration).
The ﬁrst set of variables added were abiotic fac-
tors: photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), soil
water content (%), temperature (C) and age of the
plot (no. of month since ploughed). These variables
and all possible interactions between them were
removed systematically if found to be non-signiﬁ-
cant (at P < 0.05) in a likelihood ratio deletion test
(LRT) (Pinheiro and Bates 2000; Crawley 2007).
Once abiotic terms were selected we tested for
nonlinear effects by adding polynomial terms for
each and removing them if non-signiﬁcant. The
second set of terms represented biomass effects. We
compared the likelihood of models containing
terms for: the predicted biomass of mosses, herbs
and grasses, the predicted biomass of vascular
plants and mosses and total predicted biomass.
Again, nonlinear effects were estimated by adding
polynomial terms and removing these if not sig-
niﬁcant. After this we added ﬁrst-order interactions
between retained biomass variables and abiotic
terms and removed these sequentially if non-sig-
niﬁcant, starting with the least signiﬁcant. The
third stage estimated plant functional trait effects.
Given strong correlation between many traits, we
placed the CWM for each trait in the model singly
and then substituted with another, noting the sig-
niﬁcance when it was removed. The most signiﬁ-
cant trait CWM was retained. This process was
repeated for FDvar measures in the fourth stage.
The traits used were CWMs and FDvars of: photo-
synthesis rate (lmol m2 s-1), stomatal conductance
(mmol-1 m2 s-1), plant height (cm), aboveground
biomass (g m-2), total plant biomass (g m-2), root–
shoot ratio, plant C, N and P content (mg kg-1), C
to N ratio and speciﬁc leaf area (mm2 mg-1). The
ﬁnal stage sought interactions between the re-
tained abiotic and trait variables. Initially, all pos-
sible ﬁrst-order interactions were ﬁtted. These were
then removed sequentially, as before, until only
signiﬁcant parameters remained. Once this ﬁnal
model was reached the signiﬁcance of each term
was assessed with a LRT. When assessing the sig-
niﬁcance of main effects any interactions contain-
ing the term were also removed. Sometimes it was
found that terms that were signiﬁcant earlier in the
modelling process were no longer signiﬁcant and
these terms were removed. For each of the ﬁnal
models marginal R2 (RM
2 ), a measure of ﬁt for the
ﬁxed effects of a mixed model was calculated using
the method of Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013).
AIC change on deletion from the ﬁnal model
(DAIC) was also noted to assess the relative
importance of each predictor.
RESULTS
Ecosystem Respiration
Respiration models had a low ﬁt (RM
2 0.13–0.29),
and the most important descriptors were biomass
terms
(Table 1).
Ecosystem
respiration
in
the
inactive late winter period (March Figure 1B) was
best explained by CWM root–shoot ratio, with
higher respiration under communities of plants
with a high root allocation. In contrast, the model
for June respiration, a period that was warm (Fig-
ure 1E), contained terms for grass and herb bio-
mass, both of which had a positive relationship
with respiration (Table 1). The model also con-
tained a marginally signiﬁcant negative term for
the FDvar of leaf N content; communities with di-
verse leaf N concentrations respired less. The model
for August respiration, a period with intermediate
ﬂuxes (Figure 1B), was similar to June in that grass
biomass positively affected respiration. There was
also a strong positive relationship with FDvar po-
tential biomass; communities containing plants
with a wide range of potential sizes respired more
(Table 1). In November, only the CWM of leaf P
content showed a signiﬁcant relationship with
respiration. This relationship was positive in that
communities
producing
P-rich
tissues
respired
more (Table 1). No abiotic variables were retained
in the respiration models.
Photosynthesis
Models describing photosynthesis had a reasonable
ﬁt (RM
2 = 0.37–0.62). The most important variables
were biomass, abiotic inﬂuences (that is, PAR, soil
water and temperature) and plant biomass, but
trait measures were also important in periods of
high activity (Table 2). The model for photosyn-
thesis in March, when ﬂuxes were very low
(Figure 1A), shows that ﬂuxes were positively
associated with grass biomass (which accounted for
72% (±4 SE) of AGB) and FDvar of leaf P content.
Trait–Flux Relationships

There was also a negative interaction between these
two variables; in plots with high grass biomass the
relationship between the FDvar of leaf P and pho-
tosynthesis was negative (Table 2). The model for
June photosynthesis, when C uptake was much
higher (Figure 1A) had a positive relationship with
grass biomass, but also a positive effect of herb bio-
mass, which was now far more abundant (36% of
AGB ± 4 SE) and which had a stronger per unit
biomass effect than grasses. A signiﬁcant effect of soil
moisture was also observed. This was quadratic, with
photosynthesis peaking at a soil water content of
11%. Finally, there was a weak negative relation-
ship with CWM leaf N. Photosynthesis was slightly
lower in communities containing N-rich leaves. The
model for August photosynthesis, when ﬂuxes were
still relatively high (Figure 1A) and community
biomass was it its highest (200 g m-2 ± 12.00 SE),
was complex and contained many highly signiﬁcant
descriptors. Two of these were soil water, which had
a negative relationship, and soil temperature, which
had a quadratic relationship, with photosynthesis
declining to near zero between 16 and 22C and
remaining there at higher temperatures. As in June,
photosynthesis in August was positively associated
with herb and grass biomass, but grasses had stron-
ger, and herbs weaker, per unit biomass effects
compared to the June model. Two trait variables also
had signiﬁcant relationships with August photo-
synthesis. The ﬁrst was the CWM stomatal conduc-
tance, a positive effect, and the second FDvar
potential biomass, a strong negative effect repre-
senting lower photosynthetic uptake in plots with
species of a wide range of potential biomass. This
effect interacted strongly with soil water (Table 2).
The model for November photosynthesis, when
ﬂuxes were very low (Figure 1A), was much simpler
and contained no community effects, only positive
effects of PAR and soil temperature, both of which
were low in this period (Figure 1E, F). These vari-
ables interacted so that ﬂuxes were highest where
temperature was low and PAR was high.
Evapotranspiration
The models for evapotranspiration (Table 3) were
very variable in ﬁt (RM
2 = 0.19–0.80) and generally
less parameterized than those of respiration and
photosynthesis. They typically contained fewer
biotic and more abiotic variables, which were also
the best descriptors, with the exception of highly
signiﬁcant trait measure terms in the November
model. The model for March evapotranspiration, a
period when ﬂuxes were low (Figure 1C), con-
tained a highly signiﬁcant positive effect of PAR,
and weak positive effects of moss biomass and
CWM potential height. The ﬁnal term in this model
was a positive relationship with CWM of SLA;
evapotranspiration was higher in communities of
thin leaved species. The highly signiﬁcant positive
PAR effect was also present in the June evapo-
transpiration model alongside positive effects of soil
moisture and soil temperature. In August, a period
of high evapotranspiration (Figure 1C), the model
contained a quadratic relationship with soil tem-
perature; ﬂuxes peaked around temperatures of
22C. There was a strong positive relationship with
grass biomass but a strong negative effect of CWM
potential biomass that indicated lower evapo-
transpiration ﬂuxes were potentially large species
dominated. By November ﬂuxes were very low
(Figure 1C) but the model was closely ﬁtting,
containing terms for soil moisture, a negative
relationship with CWM relative growth rate, and
an interaction between these terms. There was also
a weak but signiﬁcant relationship with the FDvar
of root to shoot ratio.
Correlations Between Traits
To investigate why trait predictors varied between
ﬂuxes and seasons correlations between commu-
nity trait measures were calculated. Strongly cor-
related traits should have similar predictive power
but correlations between traits retained in respira-
tion models were weak (Pearson’s r < 0.1). This
indicates that different functional properties deter-
mined these ﬂuxes at different times of year. In
contrast, there was a correlation between the CWM
of
plant-N
and
CWM
stomatal
conductance
(r = 0.63), which explained photosynthesis in June
and August, respectively. Similarly, there was a
correlation between CWM potential height and
CWM SLA (r = -0.68), which explained evapo-
transpiration in March and June, respectively.
Correlations were also found between the traits that
explained ﬂuxes at a particular time of year, thus
indicating that in certain seasons a trait may predict
several ﬂuxes. FDvar plant tissue P and CWM po-
tential height, which explained photosynthesis and
evapotranspiration in March correlated negatively
(r = -0.69). FDvar potential aboveground biomass,
which predicted August respiration, and FDvar total
biomass, which predicted August photosynthesis,
were also strongly correlated (r = 0.85).
DISCUSSION
By combining abiotic and biomass measures with
community trait measures, we identiﬁed several
G. Everwand and others

variables that explained grassland C and water
ﬂuxes. These results indicate that plant traits can
predict ecosystem C and water ﬂuxes, but that the
relationship between them is stronger in periods of
high biological activity. Throughout the study
ﬂuxes were low, most probably due to the low
biomass of the vegetation and the nutrient poor
status of the site (Figure 1; Table S1) and it is
possible that in more active systems trait–ﬂux
relationships will be stronger. In the following
sections, we discuss each of the predictors in our
hierarchy of controls in turn.
Abiotic and Plant Biomass Predictors
Strong relationships were observed between ﬂuxes
and abiotic drivers such as light, soil water content
and temperature. These were particularly common
terms in evapotranspiration models. Such effects
are reasonably well understood and are extensively
reported in the literature (Wohlfahrt and others
2008; Bonan and others 2012; Niu and others
2012). These abiotic variables were often the only
ones retained in models for periods of low biolog-
ical activity (for example, in November) but their
effects were seen inconsistently throughout the
year. This may not mean that they were not
inﬂuencing function but merely that they did not
vary over ranges that inﬂuence function during
data collection. Had the study been conducted over
larger spatial scales and used continuous ﬂux
measures then it is highly likely that these would
emerge as more important predictors.
The observed relationship between plant biomass
and ﬂuxes can also be explained intuitively, and it is
not surprising that biomass was a strong predictor of
ecosystem photosynthesis rate. Seasonal variation
in the plant functional groups which displayed sig-
niﬁcant biomass–ﬂux relationships may reﬂect
seasonal differences in phenology and activity. In
March photosynthesis ﬂuxes did not correspond to
herb biomass, but were higher where there was
high grass biomass. This is probably because grasses
(for example, Holcus mollis and Agrostis spp.) made
up most of the winter AGB. By June this had
changed: photosynthesis was positively associated
with high grass and herb biomass, with herbs
showing a much stronger per unit biomass effect,
thus indicating that they were active in this period,
when their biomass was also highest (Figure 1I).
Evapotranspiration showed similar seasonal trends
to the C ﬂuxes with March evapotranspiration
correlating with moss biomass, presumably because
of their relatively high biomass in this period and
their strong water holding capacity. The importance
of biomass terms, relative to trait and diversity
terms, is a similar ﬁnding to that of Laughlin (2011),
who found that biomass was a stronger predictor of
forest N dynamics than community trait measures.
CWM Traits
The results support the view that measures of
species composition can improve the ﬁt of models
explaining ﬂuxes (Hui and others 2003; Ma and
others 2011) and the importance of CWM mea-
sures was high in many models. However, it should
be noted that the high variation in species com-
position in the site, alongside the relative stan-
dardisation of other drivers such as soil and
weather, may have inﬂuenced the relative impor-
tance of vegetation measures within our models.
The identity of the traits that explained ﬂuxes were
highly variable, thus suggesting the absence of a
simple general relationship between community
traits and ecosystem C and water ﬂuxes. Instead,
the traits driving, or at least correlating with func-
tion varied seasonally. This conclusion is broadly
similar to those of Eviner and others (2006) who
found that multiple plant traits were required to
explain seasonal patterns of soil nitrogen and
phosphorus cycling and Ma and others (2011), who
found the relationship between photosynthetic
capacity and leaf N to vary between years.
Explaining the possible mechanisms underlying
trait–ﬂux relationships is more challenging than
understanding abiotic and biomass effects. How-
ever, hypotheses can be formulated as to mecha-
nisms underlying trait–ﬂux relationships as most of
the traits retained in the models have a hypothet-
ical link to resource capture or loss. The March
respiration model shows that communities with a
high root:shoot ratio respired more in winter. This
may be due to the activity of the high belowground
biomass
of
grass-dominated
communities.
By
November respiration correlated with the CWM of
plant tissue P, this may represent faster decompo-
sition of nutrient-rich plant litters in a low photo-
synthesis period. The poor ﬁt of respiration models
may be due to the lack of important soil variables
(for example, soil chemistry and microbial com-
munity structure) as descriptors but it is likely that
plant traits will represent at least some of the var-
iation in these variables, for example, CWM leaf N
and SLA are related to the relative abundance of
bacteria and fungi in grasslands (de Vries and oth-
ers 2012).
The relationship between photosynthesis rates
and correlated CWM traits of leaf N and stomatal
conductance (negative in June and positive in
Trait–Flux Relationships

August, respectively) can be understood in terms of
gas exchange. We hypothesise that low conduc-
tance low leaf N species with a conservative strat-
egy were more active in June but the opposite, fast
species were active in August. Similar links to the
leaf economics spectrum (Wright and others 2004)
may explain respiration patterns. In June, there
was also a positive correlation between evapo-
transpiration and the CWM of SLA. This may be
because high SLA plants have a greater surface area
for water loss. In August, it was the CWM of po-
tential biomass that correlated with evapotranspi-
ration, perhaps because these potentially large
species were still growing and had their stomata
open. It is difﬁcult to explain the negative rela-
tionship between the CWM of RGR and evapo-
transpiration in November, a period in which
plants are largely inactive. Similarly, it is difﬁcult to
explain the negative relationship between CWM
plant-N and photosynthesis in June, as a positive
relationship would be expected (Wright and others
2004). Such relationships may reﬂect the correla-
tion between trait measures and other unmeasured
drivers of ﬂuxes.
Trait Functional Diversity
A number of signiﬁcant relationships were found
between ﬂuxes and FDvar measures. Particularly,
strong was the positive relationship between FDvar
potential total biomass and respiration in August and
its negative relationship with photosynthesis in the
same period. This ﬁnding suggests that biodiversity
could play an important role in driving ﬂuxes at
certain times. However, the general ﬁnding was that
trait means and the biomass of functional groups
were more consistently retained as descriptors of
grassland C ﬂuxes than diversity measures. As a re-
sult, our ﬁndings are consistent with both experi-
ments that found a weak or absent relationship
between diversity measures and soil respiration (but
also that functional group presence was a key
descriptor of function) (De Boeck and others 2007;
Johnson and others 2008; Fry and others 2013), and
with biodiversity–ecosystem function experiments.
In these the diversity of functional groups or traits is
seen to strongly and positively affect water and CO2
ﬂuxes (Craine and others 2001a, b; Kunert and
others 2012; Milcu and others 2014). The results of
such experiments contrast with many observational
ﬁeld studies, which ﬁnd a weak relationship, if any,
between species or functional diversity and ecosys-
tem processes (Diaz and others 2007; Grace and
others 2007; Schumacher and Roscher 2009; Maes-
tre and others 2012). In this study, the relationship
between trait diversity and ﬂuxes was sometimes
negative. Such effects may reﬂect the correlation of
plant trait diversity with other drivers of function.
The discrepancy between ﬁeld and experimental
results may result from similar causes—other drivers
of function may dominate over biodiversity effects
under ﬁeld conditions, making them difﬁcult to de-
tect (Diaz and others 2007; Schumacher and Roscher
2009; Maestre and others 2012). Evidence for such
effects could be seen in the interaction between the
FDvar of tissue P and grass biomass in the March
photosynthesis model; both main terms were posi-
tive, but the interaction was negative, suggesting
that complementarity effects on growth (Loreau and
Hector 2001) could only be expressed in the absence
of highly competitive grass species. It is also possible
that diversity effects would be stronger if ﬂuxes over
much longer timescales were examined. Here, tem-
poral complementarity of species may result in
greater C ﬁxation over time (Allan and others 2011).
Advancing Trait–Flux Research
The results of the present study, and others in
which
plant
traits
correlate
with
function
in
observational ﬁeld studies, should be interpreted
with caution. As mentioned above, plant traits are
known to correlate with and respond to a wide
range of environmental factors (for example, soil
biological and chemical properties and climate)
many of which also control ﬂuxes and other eco-
system processes (de Vries and others 2012; Dou-
ma and others 2012; Soudzilouvskia and others
2013). We predict a stronger relationship between
traits and ﬂuxes over longer environmental gra-
dients and larger scales. At these larger scales, trait
values and ﬂuxes would strongly correlate with
abiotic environmental factors (for example, de
Vries and others 2012) and would be harder to
disentangle from them. An opposing problem oc-
curs in the relatively narrow disturbance gradient
of our study. We only sampled communities of
grasses and herbs, which differ subtly in compar-
ison to the full length of the leaf economics
spectrum (Wright and others 2004). As a result,
the importance of traits in driving ﬂuxes may be
underestimated. Relatively small differences be-
tween communities, alongside standardised mea-
suring conditions, may also have contributed to
the
sometimes
low
model
ﬁts.
Experimental
manipulation of trait distributions in controlled
and if possible orthogonal, designs may be the best
approach to teasing apart cause and correlation
and identifying the traits that control function (Fry
and others 2014).
G. Everwand and others

Another challenge to the incorporation of traits
into ﬂux models and predictions is the identiﬁca-
tion of the correct traits. Identifying traits that ex-
plain
function
is
complicated
by
a
strong
correlation between
traits (Wright and others
2004). In practical terms, this simpliﬁes the use of
traits in predicting ﬂuxes but such correlations
appear to be fairly weak in this study, probably
due to its relatively narrow range of conditions.
There is also difﬁculty in measuring the root traits
that
may
control
belowground
processes
(for
example, rhizodeposition control over soil respi-
ration), although consistent correlations between
aboveground and belowground traits have been
found (Tjoelker and others 2005; Mokany and Ash
2008).
Intraspeciﬁc variation in traits present a further
challenge to the use of database trait values to
predict ﬂuxes; trait values from databases and
glasshouse conditions may not be representative
across a range of ﬁeld conditions (Albert and others
2010). The magnitude of the error this introduces
depends upon the degree of trait plasticity, intra-
speciﬁc variation and the difference between ﬁeld
conditions and those where the database or glass-
house trait value was taken (Mokany and Ash
2008; Cordlandwehr and others 2013). Species trait
values also vary seasonally across time, a factor that
explained
temporal
ﬂux
variation
in
woody
savannah (Ma and others 2011). Such seasonal
variation was not measured here and this may
partly explain the stronger explanatory power of
trait measures in summer ﬂuxes. Conversely, our
glasshouse traits could be reasonable predictors of
winter ﬂuxes if traits shift systematically for all
species (for example, values decrease by 30% in the
winter for all species) across the seasons, thus
maintaining relative differences.
Despite
these
various
potential
problems,
a
number of studies have now shown that most trait
variation is interspeciﬁc, at both global and local
scales (Kattge and others 2011; Kichenin and oth-
ers 2013) and interspeciﬁc trait differences are
consistent across a range of environments (Ordo-
nez 2013; Kazakou and others 2014). Therefore,
glasshouse and database measures may be reliable
and seasonal and intraspeciﬁc trait variation may
be a minor source of error in ecosystem level
comparisons, at least where there are strong dif-
ferences in species composition, as in the present
study.
It is clear that identifying general relationships
between traits and function is a non-trivial task
that requires comprehensive data. A key problem
with a study such as this is that ﬂux measures only
represent a snapshot of actual ﬂux activity; it is
highly likely that a more reliable picture of how
traits, biomass and the abiotic environment interact
to determine ﬂuxes would be achievable with the
comprehensive data taken from ﬂux towers that
continuously measure ﬂuxes. However, such an
apparatus is typically replicated only once per site
requiring a network of sites, for example, FLUXNET
(Baldocchi and others 2001), to be utilised to tease
apart
the
inﬂuences
of
local
soil
conditions,
weather, climate, biomass and plant traits. Data on
how traits vary across seasons would also be useful,
particularly if these changes follow consistent pat-
terns that are predictable from a combination of
climate and database trait measures. If general
patterns could be found with such an approach
then it might then be possible to generate maps of
predicted
ﬂuxes
using
measures
of
weather,
standing plant biomass (for example, from satellite
data) and trait maps, with the latter being gener-
ated using data from trait databases, for example,
TRY (Kattge and others 2011) and information
from biodiversity surveys, for example, the UKs
Countryside Survey (Carey and others 2008). If the
response of plant communities to climate change is
predictable from the same traits (for example, SLA)
then it may also be possible to predict future
changes to ﬂuxes by extending such an approach
(Soudzilouvskia and others 2013). Similarly, better
characterization of trait variation and its functional
consequences would aid the development of dy-
namic global vegetation models and their capacity
to predict future ﬂuxes (Verheijen and others
2013).
CONCLUSIONS
This study represents an initial attempt at explain-
ing ecosystem ﬂuxes of C and water using trait
measures. In many cases, the inclusion of trait data
improved model likelihood, thus indicating that
ﬂuxes are driven not just by the interaction of plant
biomass and the abiotic environment but also the
physiology and chemistry of that biomass. Our re-
sults also indicate that an array of traits control
ﬂuxes throughout the year. Currently, species
composition is typically represented very simply in
ecosystem models and global C and water ﬂux
analyses, usually as a small number of plant func-
tional types (Sitch and others 2003; Migliavacca
and others 2011; Bonan and others 2012; Niu and
others 2012; Williams and others 2012). The sig-
niﬁcance of trait terms adds further support to calls
(De Deyn and others 2008; Ostle and others 2009)
that this approach may be insufﬁcient to accurately
Trait–Flux Relationships

represent and predict future ﬂuxes. This may re-
quire the revision of ecosystem model plant func-
tional types to a more continuous representation of
traits (for example, Verheijen and others 2013), a
challenge that may be necessary given the potential
for ecosystem C and water ﬂuxes to inﬂuence fu-
ture climate and human activities.

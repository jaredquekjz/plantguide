Abstract
Questions: What is the role of managed fallow habitats in providing resources for pol-
lination services in agricultural landscapes? How is resource provision affected by fal-
low management and landscape structure? Can the resulting variation in the value of 
fallows to pollinators be explained using the response-­and-­effect trait framework?
Location: Four semi-­arid Mediterranean agricultural regions (NE Iberian Peninsula).
Methods: Landscape complexity, fallow field age and management practices were 
identified as the explanatory factors that interact which each other and affect the 
provision of resource for pollination communities. A trait-­based approach was taken 
to model the system. Plant traits were selected on the basis of their response to abi-
otic factors (response traits) and those that influence the interaction with pollinators 
(effect traits). Plant community characterization was calculated based on both taxo-
nomic and functional indices. The linkages between the selected plant traits on con-
trasting fallows were analysed using community-­weighted mean redundancy analysis 
(CWM-­RDA).
Results: The presence of semi-­natural areas in the landscape was shown to enhance 
the value of fallows for pollinators, providing a source of diverse flower forms. In con-
trast, we found that field edges act as a relatively poor reservoir for flowering plant 
species in these areas. Land-­use practices promoting mid-­successional plant commu-
nities that support the coexistence of diverse life forms with overlapping flowering 
periods and a range of flower morphologies had the greatest potential to support a 
diverse pollinator community.
Conclusions: Early herbicide application (Feb) combined with shredding were identi-
fied as the best fallow practices for enhancing resources for pollinators. The construc-
tion of our framework will help policy makers to identify management recommendations 
that will result in the most beneficial plant communities for pollinators in fallows.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In recognition of the unintended environmental consequences of the 
drive for increased productivity of agricultural land, the European 
Union’s Agri-­Environmental Regulation Initiative has promoted various 
Agri-­Environmental Schemes (AES) to enhance levels of biodiversity on 
farmland (Whittingham, 2011). Leaving land fallow is one option avail-
able in these schemes and is one of the most promising approaches

for supporting and enhancing biodiversity in agro-­ecosystems (Ma & 
Herzon, 2014; Toivonen, Herzon, & Helenius, 2013). In contrast to 
perennial field margins, fallows present the opportunity to manage 
large areas in field centres that provide a habitat for species adapted 
to disturbed environments (Butler et al., 2009). Although the manage-
ment of fallows has tended not to be primarily driven by the delivery 
of ecosystem services, these non-­crop habitats are important land-
scape elements which may reinforce key ecosystem services such as 
pollination or biological control in the context of optimizing the multi-­
functionality of AES habitats (Kuussaari, Hyvönen, & Härmä, 2011; 
Toivonen et al., 2013).
Because fallows are located in the main area of crop fields, charac-
terized by regular disturbance, they provide a habitat for arable plant 
species that are functionally distinct from the more generalist species 
that tend to be found in the boundary features of arable landscapes. 
These arable plants (including many that could be classified as weeds) 
are more sensitive to perturbations and may also have a high intrinsic 
value as a component of biodiversity that provides distinct resources 
and functions in agroecosystems (Rotchés-­Ribalta, Blanco-­Moreno, 
Armengot, José-­María, & Sans, 2015). The value of these floras on fal-
low lands will be influenced by the historical management pressure 
imposed on the field crop and on the specific conditions generated 
by the management of the fallow. A poor seed bank resulting from 
intensively managed land will require seeds from outside the field to 
increase plant diversity; therefore the surrounding landscape may also 
play a key role, acting as a reservoir for propagules (Kohler, Verhulst, 
Van Klink, & Kleijn, 2008). A complex landscape, with a high percent-
age of natural and semi-­natural habitats, is likely to act as a refuge for 
weed species that are most sensitive to intensive agriculture and also 
offer a large amount of resources for pollinator insects (Gaba, Chauvel, 
Dessaint, Bretagnolle, & Petit, 2010; Smart, Bunce, Firbank, & Coward, 
2002; Solé-­Senan et al., 2014).
Declining weed abundance has been identified as a driver of both 
pollinator declines and losses of pollination services (Nicholls & Altieri, 
2012; Steffan-­Dewenter & Westphal, 2008). Therefore, providing 
greater plant biodiversity on farmland through the provision of areas of 
land managed specifically for this aim is likely to increase the provision 
of a range of ecosystem services, and utilizing fallow land avoids the 
negative impact arable weeds have on crop yield. However, it is diffi-
cult to quantify the enhancement of pollinator habitat (Whittingham, 
2011; Wratten, Gillespie, Decourtye, Mader, & Desneux, 2012) – all 
plant species do not contribute equally to the delivery of varied eco-
system processes, and the sustainability and resilience of these pro-
cesses may depend on aspects of diversity beyond the number of 
species present in a community (Stuart-­Smith et al., 2013). Different 
pollinators promote selection for diverse floral forms that produce 
an array of “pollination syndromes”, defined as a suite of floral traits 
that function as an advertisement and reward for pollinators (Fenster 
et al., 2004; Poveda, Steffan-­Dewenter, Scheu, & Tscharntke, 2005). 
Changes in floral characters such as morphology, colour and odour or 
food quality can influence pollinator visits (Ricou, Schneller, Amiaud, 
Plantureux, & Bockstaller, 2014; Wratten et al., 2012). Developing 
models for quantifying the relative value of different habitats in the 
context of these floral traits is a clear research need for assessing con-
trasting habitats and management recommendations. Although the 
most often used management techniques to enhance pollinator habi-
tat on farmland consists of field margin manipulation, the role of fallow 
land as a temporary patch habitat in dryland Mediterranean systems 
has seldom been explored.
The use of functional traits has been an important conceptual 
advance in linking biodiversity with ecosystem processes and associ-
ated services (Ma & Herzon, 2014). A conceptual framework has been 
developed by Lavorel and Garnier (2002) that differentiates traits as-
sociated with response to environmental and management filters – re-
sponse traits – from those that determine the effect of that change in 
the functional signature of the plant community on ecosystem services 
– predicted by effect traits. The overlaps or correlation between rele-
vant response and effect traits will determine the extent to which an 
environmental or management driver will impact ecosystem function-
ing. This framework has recently been extended to systems where ser-
vices are delivered through higher trophic groups (Lavorel et al., 2013; 
Solé-­Senan, Juárez-­Escario, Robleño, Conesa, & Recasens, 2017).
The goal of this study was to populate this framework based on 
plant species abundance measured in experimental fallows in four 
semi-­arid regions of the NE Iberian Peninsula, modelling the effects 
of landscape, age of fallow and field management as a series of filters 
acting on plant biodiversity and pollinator insects. By selecting target 
traits, we set out to (1) examine the response of plant vegetation traits 
to environment and management factors and (2) explore the overlap 
and interaction with plant ‘effect’ traits to predict the potential impact 
of changes in management in contrasting landscapes on the potential 
value of the fallows to pollinators.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Study area and experimental design
Trials were located in the Catalan part of the Ebro basin (NE Iberian 
Peninsula), an area with a flat or slightly undulating topography, medi-
terranean continental climate and average annual rainfall of 350 mm. 
A total of four separate fallow lands with different ages were selected 
as study areas: Montcortes (41°42′35.22″N, 1°13′52.33″E) and 
Ballobar (41°32′55.37″N, 0°5′59.06″E), were new fallows following 
an annual crop rotation, and Balaguer (41°44′38.92″N, 0°45′21.63″E) 
and Mas de Melons (41°30′14.26″N, 0°42′40.18″E) have remained 
as fallows for 5 and 4 years before the start of the experiment, respec-
tively. All the study sites were selected because they were located in 
areas dominated by dryland cereal crops but represented different de-
grees of landscape complexity, from structurally simple –with a high 
percentage of arable land – to more complex ones – with a high per-
centage of semi-­natural patches-­ (Appendix S1). All are also included 
in a special protection area of the Natura 2000 network, a key policy 
instrument for continental-­wide biodiversity protection in Europe.
We conducted a 3-­years field experiment (over the 2012, 2013 
and 2014 agronomic seasons, from Oct to Jun–Jul) to examine the 
succession of plant communities on fallow lands and the impact of

contrasting management. The different starting points of the fallow 
fields allowed us to test the impact of management in the context 
of different natural successional stages, from more ruderal to more 
competitive communities. In each of the four study sites, one fallow 
field was divided into 21 plots of 200 m2 as a randomized complete 
block design with three replicates for each of the treatments, which 
reproduce some of the most common cultural practices carried out in 
fallow lands. The following treatments were applied: (1) chisel plough 
– a minimum tillage resulting in soil disturbance down to 10 cm, (2) 
shredding – cutting and removal of the biomass, (3) herbicide spray 
– glyphosate at 1.5 lha−1 dose, and (4) alfalfa sowing. The treatments 
had different timings: “early dates” – Feb, for chisel and herbicide, “late 
dates” –Apr, again for chisel, herbicide and shredding, and Oct for al-
falfa sowing. Additionally, some plots were untreated (control), giving 
a total of seven treatments repeated three times in each study area: 
early chisel, late chisel, early herbicide, late herbicide, late shredding, 
early alfalfa and untreated control. At the end of each agronomic sea-
son (Oct), the vegetation of all experimental plots was cut in order to 
remove an excess of organic matter while maintaining the cumulative 
effect of the previous treatments.
2.2 | Vegetation sampling
Plant data were collected from five quadrats of 0.25 m2 located on 
each experimental plot in May, 15–20 days after the last management 
was done and when AES restrictions came into force. Coverage of 
each species was visually estimated as a percentage of the area of the 
entire quadrat (Appendix S2). Vegetation richness was recorded as the 
number of plant species identified in each quadrat.
2.3 | Landscape/habitat information
Data on landscape structure variables were obtained from an aerial 
orthophoto SIGPAC (http://sigpac.mapa.es/fega/visor/) taken dur-
ing the experimental period and measured within circles with a radius 
of 500 m around the centre of each experimental field, identified as 
the appropriate scale at which weeds are most strongly associated 
with landscape structure (Gaba et al., 2010; Marshall, West, & Kleijn, 
2006). After checking that the non-­crop elements of the landscape 
had not changed substantially during the study period, two landscape 
variables were calculated: percentage of semi-­natural habitats and 
length of field edges, which previous studies have shown are relevant 
to plant diversity and weed community composition in the study area, 
providing quantified information regarding the surrounding habitat 
(Solé-­Senan et al., 2014). Semi-­natural habitats were identified as all 
non-­cropped land uses, and edge length was calculated by summing 
all the boundaries of the fields in that area.
2.4 | Selection of plant traits
According to the model proposed by Lavorel et al. (2013), we first 
identified the plant traits that we expected to respond directly to the 
environmental and management drivers described above (response 
traits; Appendix S3). Growth form and flowering onset were included 
as they have been associated with persistence in disturbed habitats 
(Cornelissen et al., 2003; Gunton, Petit, & Gaba, 2011; McIntyre, 
Lavorel, & Tremont, 1995) and have been related to management 
practices, specifically the intensity of tillage (Fried, Kazakou, & Gaba, 
2012). Seed dispersal plays an important role as it affects plant colo-
nization, related to landscape structure and disturbance level, there-
fore modulating community assembly in space and time (Critchley, 
Allen, Fowbert, Mole, & Gundrey, 2004; McIntyre et al., 1995). Plant 
height and Specific Leaf Area (SLA, the ratio of leaf surface to leaf 
dry mass) were both expected to respond to intensity of disturbance, 
with disturbed environments being characterized by shorter plants 
with higher SLA, associated with faster resource use strategies sensu 
Westoby (1998). Plant height and SLA are also related to plant com-
petition, which will vary with the succession stage.
Second, we classified the plant traits that can influence interactions 
with pollinator communities (effect traits) in the context of the traits of 
the pollinators themselves (trophic response traits, sensu Lavorel et al., 
2013; Appendix S3). It has long been noted that changes in floral fea-
tures are highly linked with this function (Ricou et al., 2014; Wratten 
et al., 2012); so-­called “pollination syndromes” (Fenster et al., 2004), 
such as corolla morphology and colour. These were therefore selected 
as traits that determine pollinator response. Discrimination between 
different corolla shapes is associated with accessibility (Gómez et al., 
2008), distinguishing among generalists (pollinated by several to many 
animal species from different taxa) and specialist (pollinated by one or 
a few taxonomically similar animal species) flowers (Ashworth, Aguilar, 
& Galetto, 2004). This is likely to be correlated with morphometric 
parameters of pollinators (body size and mouthparts length; Fenster 
et al., 2004). Flower colour is also a plant effect trait that will deter-
mine pollinator response. It is related to UV reflection and the ability 
of perception, thus it is associated with visual attractiveness (Menzel & 
Shmida, 1993; Ricou et al., 2014). Finally, flowering duration also influ-
ences pollination visitation, determining reward (nectar and/or pollen) 
availability period (Bosch, Retana, & Cerdá, 1997).
Trait values for each of the species were obtained from the litera-
ture and from open access databases (Appendix S3). We acknowledge 
the potential importance of intraspecific variability in determining 
functional diversity (Albrecht, Schmid, Hautier, Mueller, & Müller, 
2012) and the benefit of measuring traits directly in the contrasting 
treatments. However, although this may affect the conclusions based 
on plastic traits such as SLA and height, many of the traits we included 
in our analysis (such as flower morphology and growth form) are cate-
gorical and will be largely unaffected by intraspecific differences.
Plant community characterization was calculated based on taxo-
nomic and functional indices. Two taxonomic metrics were selected: 
the total species richness (S) and the Shannon entropy index (H), pre-
sented as the exponential of Shannon-­Weaver index. With this trans-
formation, species are weighted in proportion to their frequency in 
the sampled community (Appendix S2) and thus it can be interpreted 
as an equivalent number of species in the community if they were all 
equally common and facilitates the interpretation and comparison of 
diversity among communities (Jost, 2006). To assess the functional

approach we used the CWM trait value (Garnier et al., 2004), which 
expresses the mean trait value in the community weighted by the 
relative abundance of the species. Furthermore, as a complementary 
metric, we quantified the degree to which trait values differ in a com-
munity by functional diversity (FD). We measured the variation in traits 
using Rao′s quadratic diversity, combining multiple traits into one FD 
index (Moretti et al., 2013). Unlike CWM, which is calculated per each 
trait separately, FD is based on multiple traits. The Rao coefficient has 
recently been identified as a useful metric for comparing functional 
studies of contrasting biological communities and has the flexibility 
to combine dissimilarity data from single traits into a compound value 
from multivariate analysis of multiple traits (Ricotta & Moretti, 2011).
2.5 | Statistical analysis
Species richness, H and FD (Rao) indices were used to explain variation 
in plant communities between the different habitats and landscapes 
(Appendix S4). We performed GLMM with Poisson error distribution 
to investigate the relationship with landscape features and fallow age 
taking into account only data from control plots. The effects of field 
treatments on diversity and species richness were tested, using all 
data, with a LMM, and a post-­hoc Tukey′s pair-­wise comparison was 
utilized to determine differences among treatments. Locality and plot 
were included as random factors in both analysis to control for the dif-
ferent historical management and the independence of the samples.
To quantify the innate correspondence between response–effect 
trait values in the study species pool, a PCA was carried out to char-
acterize the patterns of correlations among them. Variance in trait 
values between species was standardized to zero mean and unit SD 
to give them all equal weight in the analysis before performing the 
PCA. To assess how the variability of individual traits changes along 
the environmental factors (effects of landscape, age since fallow and 
field treatments) we performed a CWM-­RDA analysis following Kleyer 
et al. (2012). This technique uses multiple linear regressions (ordinary 
least squares) among response variables (traits) and predictors (envi-
ronmental data). Because Medicago sativa was sown in some treat-
ments, this species was excluded from the analysis in alfalfa plots, 
therefore only testing the indirect effect of the cultivation and ad-
ditional competition on the background flora. Locality and plot were 
included as covariables.
The t-­value biplots were constructed from the CWM-­RDA analysis 
for each of the explanatory variables (effects of landscape, age since 
fallow and field treatments) using the Van Dobben method (terBraak & 
Looman 1994). Previous studies have used these ordination diagrams 
to disentangle plant species relationships (Madrigal, Kelt, Meserve, 
Gutierrez, & Squeo, 2011; Schmitt, Denich, Demissew, Friis, & 
Boehmer, 2010). The ordination is based on reduced-­rank regression, 
combining multiple regressions between species traits and a particular 
site factor, and the model defined by the CWM-­RDA. Van Dobben 
circles indicate those traits with a strong relation to the explanatory 
variables tested (t-value < |2|).
Statistical analyses were performed with the R program, 3.0.2 
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with the 
lme4 package (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) and with 
CANOCO 5.0 for Windows (Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, NY, USA).
3 | RESULTS
An increase of Shannon entropy index (H) and species richness was 
observed as the percentage of semi-­natural habitat in the landscape 
increased and the fallows became older, in this case also for FD (Rao); 
there was no relationship with total length of field boundary (Table 1). 
Post-­hoc Tukey test results from LMM analysis did not find any asso-
ciation for either the taxonomical indices (H and species richness) or for 
the functional diversity index (FD Rao) between different treatments 
(data not shown). However, the late management interventions (chisel 
and herbicide) resulted in lower values of H and richness. In contrast, 
shredding and early herbicide were the treatments with highest values, 
more similar to those of the control. Regarding FD, the highest values 
were related to early herbicide and late chisel treatments (Figure 1).
The first PCA axis accounted for 26.23% of the variance and 
identified a trade-­off between plant traits that were related to a 
successional gradient from more ruderal to competitive plant strat-
egies (Figure 2). Species with a low PCA1 score were characterized 
as having a high SLA, early flowering or annual life cycle, graminoid 
forms, white-­greenish-­brownish flower colours with anemophilous 
and open entomophilous shapes. In contrast, species with a high 
PCA1 score had a perennial life form, late flowering time, tall stat-
ure, autochory seed dispersal, zygomorphic and tubular corollas, 
and yellow and blue flower colours. The contrasting plant strategies 
reflected in the multivariate analysis provide a useful framework 
for interpreting the response of the plant communities to different 
management treatments and potential value to pollinators. Trait re-
lationships from Van Dobben circle results have been summarized in 
Table 2 for those plant traits which response to the environmental 
factors (response traits), and in Table 3 for the traits underpinning

interactions between plants and pollinators (effect traits/trophic re-
sponse traits). The results are summarized in the following sections.
3.1 | Landscape features and age since fallow
Fallows within landscapes with a high percentage of semi-­natural hab-
itats had a community with a higher proportion of legumes, autochory 
seed dispersal and later flowering species, characteristics correlated 
with zygomorphic corolla and blue flower colour (Tables 2 and 3). A 
longer length of field edges promoted a community dominated by an-
nual graminoid species and anemochory and unassisted seed disper-
sal, related positively with characteristics as white-­greenish-­brownish 
flower colours and negatively with purple and yellow corollas and long 
flowering duration. A successional pattern was evident in that older 
fallows had plant communities more dominated by perennial forbs, 
such as hemicryptophytes and geophytes, and species with autochoric 
seed dispersal. These traits in turn were positively correlated with tu-
bular corollas and yellow flower colour, and negatively correlated with 
open entomophilous corollas and purple colour.
3.2 | Field management practices
Among field management treatments, a promotion of annual plants 
by early interventions was observed together with the presence of 
shrubs on the early herbicide treatment (Tables 2 and 3). Late herbi-
cide and shredding increased the presence of perennial forms (mainly 
hemicryptophytes). Graminoid forms were more prevalent on early 
chisel and alfalfa treatments than forbs. A late flowering onset was 
observed on the early herbicide practices, while in late herbicide treat-
ments, a positive relation with taller plants and early flowering time 
was observed. The characteristics of plant communities resulting from

the different field treatments were correlated with traits which are 
likely to determine pollinator interaction such as anemophilous corol-
las, positively related with alfalfa, chisel and shredding practices. Early 
herbicide and shredding treatments were positively correlated with 
open entomophilous corollas and negatively with tubular ones, as was 
observed in alfalfa and early chisel treatments. Yellow flowers showed 
a positive correlation to late herbicide, and other flower colours (such 
as greenish and brownish) were positive correlated with alfalfa, chisel 
treatments and shredding. Finally, a longer period of flowering was 
related to late chisel and early herbicide treatments.
4 | DISCUSSION
We aimed to better understand how altering fallow habitats by en-
vironmental or human-­associated disturbances could influence the 
functional trait composition of the vegetation, selecting between dif-
ferent plant ecological strategies. From the shifts in response and ef-
fect traits we predicted changes in the attractiveness for pollinators. 
Following the response–effect framework (Appendix S5), we now dis-
cuss: (1) the functional response of plant communities to environmen-
tal and management drivers and (2) the overlap with flowering traits 
that determine the value of fallows for pollinators.
4.1 | Response of fallow plant communities to 
environmental and management drivers
Understanding the processes determining the variation of biological 
communities in habitats managed as part of agri-­environment schemes 
requires analyses at multiple scales. Although particular management 
strategies may benefit certain species, it has been shown that land-
scape characteristics also play an important role in determining plant 
and pollinator diversity in managed ecosystems (Carvalheiro et al., 
2011). Any change in species composition also needs to be related 
to functional characteristics, since a reduction in functional diversity 
implies a substitution of specialist species by generalists, leading to 
a functional homogenization of the communities and a potential in-
crease in competition among pollinators for resources (Clavel, Julliard, 
& Devictor, 2010; Tadey, 2015).
Areas of semi-­natural habitat and field margins represent areas 
of least disturbance within arable systems, acting as a sink that pro-
vides shelter and refugia for plant species which are unable to persist 
in the harsh conditions of intensely cultivated habitats (Fried, Petit, 
Dessaint, & Reboud, 2009), and as a source, allowing immigration of 
plant species either to crop fields or new uncultivated patches such 
as fallow lands (Gabriel, Thies, & Tscharntke, 2005; Kleijn, Rundlöf, 
Scheper, Smith, & Tscharntke, 2011; Tscharntke, Klein, Kruess, Steffan-­
Dewenter, & Thies, 2005). These habitats generally have lower fertility

ecological stability of semi-­natural areas is also reflected in the pres-
ence of species with late time of first flowering (Pinke & Gunton, 2014) 
or autochory seed dispersal. Autochory is a short-­distance dispersal 
mechanism, and the low colonizing capacity over space suggests that 
species are in an optimal area. An increased proportion of semi-­natural 
habitat in the landscape surrounding the fallows was reflected in a 
greater representation of these traits in the field centres and an overall 
increase in taxonomic and functional diversity. Contrary to our expec-
tation and to the trend with an increase of semi-­ natural areas around 
fallow-­fields, more field edges in the landscape did not show any re-
lation either with the taxonomic indices or with the functional diver-
sity (FD (Rao)). In our study system, field edges were not managed for 
biodiversity and only provided extremely narrow boundaries with no 
capacity to buffer negative effects from neighbouring areas due to the 
high intensity of agricultural practices (Aavik & Liira, 2010; Ma, Tarmi, 
& Helenius, 2002), resulting in a dominance of annual grasses. There 
may, therefore, be potential to combine improved field margin man-
agement with the appropriate management of fallows to add value to 
both components of the agricultural landscape.
Studies of successional dynamics in managed ecosystems have 
highlighted that old communities tend to be more competitive, lead-
ing to uniform landscapes which provide fewer niches for weeds 
or insects (Kuussaari et al., 2011; Lososová et al., 2006). Our re-
sults show a contrasting trend, with older fallows having a higher 
taxonomic and functional diversity and coexistence of species 
with dissimilar functionality. Low disturbance rates, the chance to 
develop different resource acquisition strategies or unpredictable 
natural regeneration have all been suggested as causes of the per-
sistence of a diversity of flower species with high resource value 
(Wratten et al., 2012). It may be, however, that as the fallows age 
further, the dominance of a few, more competitive species may in-
crease and that we mainly observed mid-­successional communities 
with a combination of earlier ruderal and later competitive strate-
gies. Succession of the vegetation with fallow age also revealed a 
gradient of plant strategies as noted by Garnier et al. (2004). Early 
fallow stages, immediately following agricultural disturbances, had 
a community dominated by opportunistic ruderal species with 
traits associated with fast growth, annual life cycle and high SLA. 
Anemochory seed dispersal is related most strongly to the ability of 
a species to colonize new patches that may be a long distance from 
the source population (Dupré & Ehrlén, 2002; Kohler et al., 2008). 
Hemicryptophytes and geophytes appear as the dominant life forms 
on late successional fallow stages, mainly represented by Asterceae 
(Crepis, Silybum or Carduus) and autochory seed dispersal, indicative 
of competitive plant communities.
Among the management regimens tested in this study, early her-
bicide application is the one that led to a habitat occupied by both 
annual and woody plants, diversifying vegetation structures and so, 
ecological strategies. Glyphosate is a non-­selective contact herbi-
cide that controls a wide range of weeds. However, phanerophytes, 
chamaephytes and most of the hemicryptophytes are the least 
harmed, leading to a more heterogeneous habitat. The role of these 
biological forms, in contrast to annual herbaceous plants, resulted 
in a sparse and patchy habitat with a lower density of vegetation. 
Previous studies have shown that periodicity of flowering is adapted 
to the intensity and frequency of soil disturbances in herbicide 
treatments (Gaba, Fried, Kazakou, Chauvel, & Navas, 2013). Tillage 
promoted pioneer annual plants with fast life cycles (Sojneková 
& Chytrý, 2015). It is also noteworthy that the annual graminoid 
dominance on alfalfa and early chisel was related to early soil dis-
turbance, while late chisel managements were characterized by a 
predominance of perennial rhizomatous/stoloniferous graminoids 
such as Cynodon dactylon, which permit an effective colonization of 
bare ground sites (Kahmen, Poschlod, & Schreiber, 2002). Although 
we have shown that the effect of herbicides can be interpreted in 
the context of a disturbance regime and so related to plant traits, it 
is also the case that herbicide selectivity will play a major part in the 
structuring of communities in agricultural landscapes. These effects 
may ultimately have to be modelled at the level of individual species.
4.2 | Interaction of response and effect traits
Identifying key plant traits which influence the interaction with pol-
linators will be useful for understanding the effect of the responses 
of communities to environment and management discussed above 
for pollination services. Pollinators were not directly measured in this 
study; however, well-­established published relationships between 
flowering traits and attractiveness to pollinators allow us to predict 
the impact of the landscape and treatments on the value for different 
plant communities to pollinators.
In our study, the increase of legumes on fallows in landscapes with 
a higher proportion of semi-­natural habitats was linked with zygomor-
phic corolla and blue flower colour, well-­known syndromes of com-
plex flowers that are associated with pollination by long-­tongued bees 
(Corbet, 1995; Fenster et al., 2004). However, the high functional di-
vergence on these fallows may indicate that, although pollinators spe-
cializing in zygomorphic flowers would be expected to be promoted, 
these fallows also support plants that provide resources to generalist 
pollinators. The presence of these patches of relatively high-­contrast 
habitat types, or ‘ecotones’, is predicted to enhance the value of man-
aged fallows for pollinators. Moreover, semi-­natural habitats provide 
a place to nest and hibernate for the major pollinator groups (Batáry, 
Báldi, Kleijn, & Tscharntke, 2011), making them an essential element 
in the landscape. But, not all the so-­called ecotone′ elements in the 
landscape were acting in the same way on the fallow floras, with a high 
proportion of field boundaries having a deleterious effect on resource 
provision for pollinators. The high level of disturbance generated by 
the farm practices has led to an impoverishment of the habitat value 
of field edges, acting as a source of undesirable species such as gram-
inoids. The Poaceae family is considered to be inaccessible and so less 
frequently visited by pollinators (Ricou et al., 2014), leading to a re-
duction of flower features that promote pollinator–plant interactions 
(Fenster et al., 2004).
Along the age–gradient succession, the dominance of more gen-
eralist flower features in early stages such as open entomophilous 
corollas is notable and suggests that, at this stage, all pollinator fauna 

    |  9

may be functionally equivalent (Fenster et al., 2004). As expected, 
different successional stages were not functionally equivalent and 
one approach to management would be to design interventions 
that aim to maintain communities in the successional stage that 
delivers the most value to pollinators. We suggest maintaining mid-­
successional communities would be optimal for supporting a wide 
range of pollinators in our system. To achieve this type of habitat, 
intermediate levels of disturbance may be required (Wratten et al., 
2012). In this regard, early herbicide treatments were beneficial 
because they promoted a heterogeneous habitat structure allow-
ing a high coexistence of life forms and so an overlap of flowering 
periods. The increased abundance of flowers with open entomoph-
ilous corollas as opposed to anemophilous ones (which tended to 
dominate in other management treatments) was another important 
component of the floras adapted to this treatment. However, the 
role of pesticides in agriculture in causing pollinator declines is well 
documented, especially where spraying time coincides with flower-
ing time (Nicholls & Altieri, 2012). Here the application was made 
in early February, out of the flowering peaks of most of the species. 
Open entomophilous and anemophilous corollas were promoted 
by shredding management, while anemophilous ones dominated 
in chisel and alfalfa treatments, resulting in poor habitat quality in 
terms of attractiveness for pollination. Alfalfa is generally consid-
ered as a temporary pollinator-­friendly cover crop (Wratten et al., 
2012) because of its beneficial flower features. Nevertheless, this 
area presents a low productivity index (Oñate, Atance, Bardají, & 
Llusia, 2007), and alfalfa crops without an irrigation supply often 
fail. At the same time, the early soil removal caused by the alfalfa 
sowing favours the development of Poaceae species, the least at-
tractive family for insects.
A landscape perspective is needed to achieve conservation 
goals on fallow lands. While local effects of management can be 
detected over small scales that share a similar environment, deriv-
ing more general rules of plant community assembly in fallows is 
dependent upon regional scales that aggregate environmental het-
erogeneity. In order to achieve this, an important distinction be-
tween the landscape elements must be made. As a next step to 
further assess ways to enhance pollinator habitats in fallow lands, 
a validation of the results of the study would be desirable to deter-
mine the relationships between our predictions and information on 
insect species′ abundance and diversity. Also, here we have tested 
the field practices that are most commonly developed in these non-­
crop habitats; however other management options could also be 
applied. Since livestock tend to promote vegetation heterogeneity, 
selective grazing could be suggested as an alternative management 
practice in fallows. If sowing is an option, an important issue to take 
into account to enhance its efficiency is to have a good knowledge 
about the abundance and diversity of groups of pollinator in the 
region before choosing plant species (Pywell et al., 2011). The use 
of herbicides in a conservation study often causes controversy and, 
although chemical application could presumably be beneficial for 
some target species, future assessment of its potential damage to 
insects or wildlife in general is first required.

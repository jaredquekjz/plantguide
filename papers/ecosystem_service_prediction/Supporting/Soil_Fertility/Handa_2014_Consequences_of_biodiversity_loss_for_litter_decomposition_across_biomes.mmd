The decomposition of dead organic matter is a major determinant of carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere ${ }^{1-3}$. Decomposition is driven by a vast diversity of organisms that are structured in complex food webs ${ }^{2,4}$. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition is critical ${ }^{4-6}$ given the rapid loss of species worldwide and the effects of this loss on human well-being ${ }^{7-9}$. Yet despite comprehensive syntheses of studies on how biodiversity affects litter decomposition ${ }^{4-6,10}$, key questions remain, including when, where and how biodiversity has a role and whether general patterns and mechanisms occur across ecosystems and different functional types of organism ${ }^{4,9-12}$. Here, in field experiments across five terrestrial and aquatic locations, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics, we show that reducing the functional diversity of decomposer organisms and plant litter types slowed the cycling of litter carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, we found evidence of nitrogen transfer from the litter of nitrogen-fixing plants to that of rapidly decomposing plants, but not between other plant functional types, highlighting that specific interactions in litter mixtures control carbon and nitrogen cycling during decomposition. The emergence of this general mechanism and the coherence of patterns across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems suggest that biodiversity loss has consistent consequences for litter decomposition and the cycling of major elements on broad spatial scales.

Biological diversity that directly influences litter decomposition exists at multiple trophic levels ${ }^{4}$. This diversity includes plants that produce litter mixtures of varying quality, microbial decomposers and invertebrate consumers of varying body size, the last two of which selectively use the heterogeneous resources provided by litter mixtures ${ }^{4,13}$. General principles of the effects of biodiversity on litter decomposition have proved elusive: both pioneering work ${ }^{14}$ and recent syntheses have highlighted contrasting effects of litter species richness on decomposition ${ }^{4-6,15,16}$. In part, this variation appears to be due to site-specific conditions, including contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as between geographic settings. Further differences may arise from variation in experimental protocols, the plant species studied and the types of decomposers included in a given experiment. Such methodological discrepancies have complicated syntheses across studies, hindering the emergence of common patterns and mechanisms.

Here we report the results of the first concerted experiments studying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition by manipulating diversity across trophic levels and distinct biomes in both forest floor and
stream habitats (Extended Data Table 1). We proposed that the functional diversity of decomposers (variation in body size) and of leaf litter (variation in litter quality) promotes C and N cycling across contrasting locations (subarctic to tropical) and ecosystem types (terrestrial versus aquatic). Body size encapsulates numerous species traits that are relevant to ecosystem functioning, and extinction scenarios project that the larger species will be preferentially lost from biological communities ${ }^{17,18}$. Similarly, plant functional types reflect differences in leaf quality traits that determine litter decomposition independently of geographical location ${ }^{19}$. Plant functional types are defined here in terms of plant C allocation strategies (deciduous versus evergreen), N acquisition strategies ( N -fixing versus non-N-fixing) and litter recalcitrance (rapidly decomposing versus slowly decomposing) (Extended Data Table 2).

Mixing leaflitter from various plant functional types together resulted in accelerated C and N dynamics, as indicated by the overall net positive effects on C and N loss (that is, increased C and N loss with increasing functional diversity) (Fig. 1, C loss; Extended Data Fig. 1, N loss; $P< 0.05, \mathrm{C}$ and N loss). However, C loss from litter mixtures was only $2.9 \pm 0.8 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{g}^{-1}$ (mean $\pm$ s.e.m.) of initial litter dry mass greater than the expected loss based on data from single litter functional types, indicating only a modest increase in C cycling as a result of litter mixing. Although also statistically significant ( $\mathrm{P}<0.01$ ), the difference in the loss of N across all litter mixtures was very small $\left(0.1 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{N}^{-1}\right.$ of initial litter dry mass; mean $\pm$ s.e.m.; Extended Data Fig. 1). The net litter diversity effect on C loss was stronger in terrestrial than in aquatic ecosystems ( $P<0.001$, Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 3), supporting theoretical predictions ${ }^{4}$ but contrasting the results of a meta-analysis in which diversity effects on decomposition were significant only for streams ${ }^{6}$. Sorting the litter mixtures into species at the end of the experiments enabled us to explore potential reasons for this discrepancy, by partitioning the net diversity effects into complementarity effects (that is, the effects resulting from synergistic or antagonistic interactions) and selection effects (that is, the effects arising when the presence of a particular functional type with high (or low) process rates dominates a mixture) ${ }^{20}$. The observed net diversity effects were clearly driven by complementarity effects that were stronger than selection effects (Fig. 1). Overall, the complementarity effect was a similar strength to the net effect for C loss ( $3.4 \pm 0.9 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{g}^{-1}$ ), and even stronger than the net effect for N loss $\left(1.0 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{N} \mathrm{g}^{-1}\right)$. By contrast, the mean selection effects were not significant. The characteristics of the forest floor habitat that may favour complementarity effects include strong fluctuations in temperature and humidity and a homogenous litter cover ${ }^{4}$. Conversely,

the observed negative complementarity effects in subarctic and tropical streams could reflect a low density and low taxon richness of litter consumers (Extended Data Table 4) and thus limited potential for complementary resource use ${ }^{21}$.

Our experiments also show that completeness of the decomposer community, which is rarely considered in large-scale studies, is important for C and N dynamics during litter decomposition (Fig. 2, Table 1 and Extended Data Table 5). The presence of medium-sized invertebrates ( $\leq 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter) in the decomposer community increased the average C and N loss across all sites by $2.1 \pm 0.8 \%$ and $2.0 \pm 1.0 \%$, respectively. The complete decomposer community (which included organisms up to 5 mm in diameter) increased the average $C$ loss across all sites by $10.6 \pm 1.0 \%$ and the average N loss across all sites by $11.1 \pm 1.2 \%$ (Fig. 2). This effect was consistently positive across all but the Mediterranean

terrestrial site. Thus, the presence of large fauna clearly has a major impact on decomposition (Table 1), as reported previously ${ }^{22-24}$; however, in line with previous studies, the importance of large fauna varies among locations in aquatic ${ }^{22}$ and terrestrial ecosystems ${ }^{23,24}$. In our study, the strong effects of the complete decomposer community at the temperate and tropical locations correspond to high relative abundances of millipedes and termites at the terrestrial temperate and tropical sites, respectively (Extended Data Table 6). Similarly, the large effect of the complete decomposer community at the temperate aquatic site corresponds to the high abundance of a particularly efficient amphipod detritivore (Extended Data Table 4). Our data clearly indicate that the largebodied organisms are the most critical for decomposition. These animals also tend to face the greatest extinction risk ${ }^{17}$.

Litter mixing and completeness of the decomposer community interacted with each other to affect C and N loss, although this interaction explains less of the variance than the main effects (Table 1). C loss and, even more so, N loss increased in the presence of particular plant functional types and with increasing completeness of the decomposer community (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 7). Although the type of decomposer community did not significantly change the net effect of diversity on Closs ( $P=0.67$ ) or N loss ( $P=0.30$ ) (Extended Data Table 3), it emerged as a significant factor in the selection effect for both C loss ( $P<0.05$ ) and N loss ( $P<0.05$ ). Additionally, the interaction between the rapidly decomposing litter type and the decomposer community was significant in explaining the selection effect and the overall net diversity effect on C loss ( $P<0.05$ ) and N loss ( $P<0.05$ ), suggesting that large decomposers are particularly important drivers of C and N loss from litter mixtures that contain rapidly decomposing litter. The food preference behaviour of decomposers could be important in accounting for this result, as has previously been implied for terrestrial ${ }^{25}$ and aquatic ${ }^{26}$ ecosystems.

A key result of our large-scale study is that the effects of litter diversity on C and N dynamics can be largely explained by the presence of particular functional plant types in litter mixtures, supporting the idea that the range and relative abundance of plant traits in ecosystems underlie the effects of species richness on ecosystem processes ${ }^{27,28}$. The effects of the presence of litter from particular plant functional types, or the interactions among these, were consistent across locations at both terrestrial and aquatic sites, together accounting for about $10 \%$ of the total variance as shown in the full analysis of variance model (Table 1, $P<0.05$;

Extended Data Table 7). Beyond the presence or absence of particular plant functional types, we found no significant effect of the richness of plant functional types in the litter on C loss ( $P=0.93$ ), although a positive effect was observed on N loss ( $P<0.001$ ) (Table 1). The effect on N loss was strongest when the most complete decomposer communities had access to the litter (litter richness $\times$ decomposer community interaction; $P<0.05$ ). Our results indicate that partitioning the diversity effects into the separate contributions of the presence or absence of particular plant functional types in litter and their interactions can help move interpretations of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments beyond the current dichotomy between broad generalizations and claims of idiosyncratic compositional effects ${ }^{5,14,15}$.

An intriguing finding in this context is that the strongest positive interaction emerged between two particular litter functional types: N-fixing plants and rapidly decomposing deciduous plants (Extended Data Table 7). When these types were present together in litter mixtures, the average C loss was $13.5 \%$ greater than the average $C$ loss of all litter combinations, and the N loss was $32.5 \%$ greater. This general pattern holds across

terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems from the subarctic to the tropics. Moreover, relative to the total amount of N in the litter initially, less N remained in the litter of N -fixing plants when rapidly decomposing litter was present than when it decomposed alone (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 8). The rapidly decomposing litter, in turn, contained more N when litter from N -fixing plants was present than when it decomposed alone (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 8). On average across all of the sites, the litter of N -fixing plants lost $20.6 \%$ of its initial N when it decomposed alone but $25.0 \%$ when it decomposed in the presence of litter from rapidly decomposing plants. By contrast, the litter of rapidly decomposing plants lost $18.1 \%$ of its N when it decomposed alone but $13.4 \%$ when litter from N-fixing plants was present. This striking pattern across locations and ecosystems suggests, for the first time from field data, that N can be transferred between litter types. A plausible mechanism for this effect is that fungal decomposers tap the nutrient reservoir of the N -fixing plant litter, boosting C use and fungal growth in the N -deficient litter, which provide high-quality $\mathrm{C}^{29}$ (see section Extended discussion on litter N transfer in Methods). The average net differences in N fluxes between single-species litter and litter mixtures of these two plant functional types account for approximately 0.25 g N per square metre of ground area, representing up to one-tenth of the total annual N input from leaf litter fall. Thus, although the biodiversity effects that we report here, in line with recent syntheses ${ }^{9-11}$, are smaller than those noted for other ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production, these changes in N fluxes can have important consequences for the ecosystem. Even slight differences in the N dynamics in litter mixtures compared with the respective single-species litter can substantially change the N supply to primary producers and other organisms over large spatial and temporal scales ${ }^{30}$.

The implications of our results are that changes in C and N cycling in response to biodiversity loss are largely predictable across vastly different latitudes in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, by taking into account relatively simple plant traits and the structural characteristics of decomposer communities. To provide robust projections of how ecosystems respond to a loss of biodiversity, it is essential to identify the mechanisms that result from specific interactions between the components of biodiversity as we describe here. With the consistent patterns and mechanisms of biodiversity effects that we have shown, such projections now seem to be within reach.

\section*{METHODS SUMMARY}

The field experiments followed an identical protocol at ten sites, encompassing both aquatic (forest stream) and terrestrial (forest floor) ecosystems at five locations across a latitudinal gradient spanning from the subarctic to the tropics, with intermediate locations in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean climates (Extended Data Table 1). Leaf litter from native tree or shrub species representing four common functional types (evergreen, deciduous with slowly decomposing litter, deciduous with rapidly decomposing litter, and N -fixing) that naturally occur across all locations ( 18 species in total; Extended Data Table 2) was exposed to decomposers in a total of 2,250 experimental microcosms set up in the field with all possible location-specific single-species and multi-species combinations. We used a randomized block design with five blocks per site. Each block contained 1 replicate of 15 combinations of litter types (that is, all possible combinations of 4 litter species) $\times 3$ microcosm mesh sizes (totalling 45 microcosms per block). The three mesh sizes used to construct the field microcosms allowed us to establish three increasingly complete decomposer communities (small, medium-sized and complete) in the microcosms. Small-sized decomposer communities included microorganisms and fauna that passed through $50-\mu \mathrm{m}$ and $250-\mu \mathrm{m}$ mesh screens (DIATEX) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, respectively. The medium-sized decomposer communities contained all organisms (including invertebrates) that passed through $1-\mathrm{mm}$ mesh screens, whereas the complete decomposer communities included all organisms that passed through $5-\mathrm{mm}$ mesh screens. Litter mass loss was allowed to proceed to the same defined decomposition stage ( $40-50 \%$ of the mass of the least recalcitrant litter type remaining at each location; Extended Data Table 9) to ensure the comparisons of C and N loss, as well as the effects of diversity, at a similar decomposition stage among sites, using analysis of variance models (see Methods section).

\section*{METHODS}

Experimental design. Our field experiments followed an identical protocol at a total of ten sites, representing either an aquatic ecosystem (forest stream) or a terrestrial ecosystem (forest floor). Five locations were selected across a broad latitudinal gradient spanning from the subarctic to the tropics, with intermediate locations in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean climates (Extended Data Table 1). Across all five locations, and in both the stream and forest ecosystems, the experiments consisted of a randomized block design in which the leaf litter from 4 common native plants (corresponding to the functional types shown in Extended Data Table 2) and 11 mixtures of these litter types (corresponding to all possible litter combinations within a location) were enclosed in nylon mesh screens (DIATEX) and placed in the field in five blocks ( $n=5$ locations $\times 2$ ecosystem types $\times 15$ litter combinations $\times 3$ mesh sizes $\times 5$ blocks $=2,250$ microcosms). The four functional plant types represent distinct plant C allocation strategies (deciduous versus evergreen), N acquisition strategies ( N fixer versus not a N fixer) and litter recalcitrance of deciduous non-N-fixers (rapidly decomposing versus slowly decomposing).

The three mesh sizes used to construct the microcosms enabled us to distinguish three increasingly complete decomposer communities (small, medium-sized and complete) that established themselves on the decomposing litter. Small decomposers included microorganisms and small-sized fauna that passed through $50-\mu \mathrm{m}$ and $250-\mu \mathrm{m}$ mesh screens in terrestrial and aquatic systems, respectively. The mediumsized decomposer communities contained all organisms (including invertebrates) that passed through $1-\mathrm{mm}$ mesh screens, whereas the complete decomposer communities included all decomposers that passed through $5-\mathrm{mm}$ mesh screens. Litter mass loss was allowed to proceed to the same defined decomposition stage ( $40-50 \%$ of the litter mass of the least recalcitrant litter type remaining at each site; Extended Data Table 9) to ensure meaningful comparisons of C and N loss among all sites. At all ten sites, extra microcosms containing the fastest decomposing litter type served as benchmark indicators of decomposition rates.
Site characterization. The five stream locations were characterized in terms of their geomorphological, physical and chemical features (Extended Data Table 1). Water samples were collected for chemical analyses at the time of establishing the experiments. Samples for inorganic N and phosphorus determination were filtered over $0.45-\mu \mathrm{m}$ pore-size cellulose acetate membrane filters and transported to the laboratory in a cooler at about $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, where they were frozen for later analysis at Eawag, Switzerland.

At the five forest sites (Extended Data Table 1), the leaf area index was measured at breast height on a uniformly cloud-covered day when the forest canopy was fully developed, using an LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-COR) for the subarctic location, an LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-COR) for the Mediterranean and tropical locations, and a SunScan Canopy Analysis System (Delta T Devices) for the temperate locations. Data for the boreal location were provided by K. Bishop \& P.-E. Mellander. To characterize the soil at each of the terrestrial sites, three samples from each experimental block were taken with a soil corer ( 5 cm diameter, 10 cm height), pooled, stored in plastic bags at $4{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then sent cooled to the University of Göttingen (Germany). Sieved soil samples ( $<2 \mathrm{~mm}$ sieve pore size) were analysed for pH ( 2 g soil in $20 \mathrm{ml} 0.01 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ ) and C and N concentration (using an NA 1500 Carlo Erba elemental analyser). The microbial biomass of the soil was estimated using the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method. The microbial respiratory response was measured in an electrolytic $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-microcompensation apparatus at $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. These measurements were made hourly for 24 h . The microbial biomass was measured after the addition of glucose ( $8 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Cg}^{-1}$ dry soil) as a substrate to saturate the catabolic activity of the microorganisms. The maximum initial respiratory response (MIRR; $\mu \mathrm{lO} \mathrm{O}^{-1}$ dry mass $\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ ) was calculated as the mean of the lowest three readings within the first 10 h , and the microbial biomass was calculated as $C_{\text {mic }}=38 \times$ MIRR (in $\mu \mathrm{g} C_{\text {mic }} \mathrm{g}^{-1}$ soil dry mass).

Data loggers (SL52T, Signatrol) were installed in some microcosms at all ten sites, to record the temperature every 2 h . These temperature measurements were taken in the same litter treatment for all three mesh sizes in three of the five experimental blocks.
Leaf litter collection. A total of 20 litter types were collected at the 5 locations of our coordinated experiment. This litter corresponded to the same four functional types per location that were introduced above: N-fixing plants, rapidly decomposing deciduous plants, slowly decomposing deciduous plants and evergreen plants (Extended Data Table 2). Litter from these four functional types varies with respect to several quality traits ${ }^{31}$ (Extended Data Table 2). The selected species were common native trees or, in two cases, native woody shrubs (Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Rhododendron tomentosum) occurring at each location. The litter was collected during location-specific leaf senescence either by hand (V. vitis-idaea and R. tomentosum) or by using litter traps. An exception was litter from the temperate evergreen species Ilex aquifolium, which was obtained by cutting branches in the field and simulating senescence in the laboratory for three weeks. Leaves with signs of herbivory
or disease were discarded. The litter from multiple individual trees or shrubs of each species was pooled and dried at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Leaf litter field incubations. Stream experiments were conducted by exposing 5 g litter batches in tetrahedral mesh microcosms ( $17 \mathrm{~cm} \times 25 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) made of one of three mesh sizes ( $250 \mu \mathrm{~m}, 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ or 5 mm ) to provide access to decomposer communities differing in body size. The microcosms were randomly attached (about 40 cm distance between microcosms) to five $20-\mathrm{m}$ metal chains, each in a separate riffle (short, relatively shallow sections of streams with non-stagnating water) 20 m or farther apart from each other (experimental blocks). The chains were fixed in the stream with reinforcing bars in fairly homogeneous sand-gravel stream sections, where leaves accumulated naturally. All microcosms were submerged at depths sufficient to ensure that they were not exposed to air when water levels dropped. Care was taken to expose the litter to constant flow conditions, avoiding deep depositional areas (that is, pools and backwaters) with slow or no flow and rocky riffles with broken flow.

Terrestrial experiments on the forest floor were conducted by incubating 8 g location-specific litter ( 4 g only in the subarctic because of limited litter availability for some species) in field microcosms made of polyethylene cylinders ( 15 cm diameter, 10 cm height) covered with $50-\mu \mathrm{m}$ mesh at the top and bottom to allow the passage of water but to prevent the entry of natural litter fall from above and the loss of small litter particles from the bottom. Two windows ( $5 \mathrm{~cm} \times 18 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) were cut into the cylinders and covered with $50-\mu \mathrm{m}, 1-\mathrm{mm}$ or $5-\mathrm{mm}$ mesh to provide access to decomposer communities differing in body size. The windows were cut close to the bottom of the cylinders to ensure that decomposers had access to a continuous layer of litter outside and inside the microcosms. An additional $1.5-\mathrm{cm}$ height plastic ring of the same diameter as the cylindrical microcosms was attached at the bottom of the microcosm, making it possible to push the microcosms gently into the top soil (to a depth of 1.5 cm ). This ring held the terrestrial microcosms properly in place while the bottom mesh was in intimate contact with the soil surface. In cases in which pushing the microcosms into the soil was difficult (for example, in the tropical forest with its dense superficial tree roots), the $1.5-\mathrm{cm}$ rings were fitted with a separate plastic or metal ring before placing the microcosms. The microcosms were separated from each other by at least 50 cm . They were randomly distributed within blocks that were established at least 20 m apart from each other. Sample harvest and processing. We removed the decomposing litter of all species from the field when $40-50 \%$ of the initial litter mass of the fastest decomposing species was remaining. As a consequence, the duration of litter decomposition varied among locations and ecosystem types (Extended Data Table 9). This procedure ensured that similar decomposition stages were sampled at all sites, facilitating meaningful comparisons of decomposition rates and litter diversity effects. All litter samples were separated into the constituent species immediately after litter retrieval. The litter recovered from the streams was gently washed to remove any adhering material and invertebrates. The litter from the terrestrial sites was cleaned by gently brushing off any dirt without using water, to prevent the leaching of nutrients. The litter samples were then dried at $65^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 48 h . A correction factor was used to convert the initial litter mass (weighed after drying at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) to the final dry mass, based on ten randomly selected samples per litter type that were successively dried and weighed in the laboratory first at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and then at $65^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Litter $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ loss. The initial $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ concentrations of each of the 20 individual litter types were determined from 5 random samples. The final C and N concentrations after retrieval of the litter from the field were also measured for each individually sorted litter type from each microcosm. This process resulted in a total of 5,400 samples for which to calculate the percentage C and N loss for each litter type under the various conditions. Following the determination of litter dry mass, all initial and final samples were ground with a ball mill (Retsch PM 400) to a fine homogeneous powder. Subsamples of 3 mg were analysed for C and N concentrations using a CHN elemental analyser (Flash EA 1112 Series, Thermo Finnigan). C and N loss (\%) from the litter during field exposure was calculated as $100 \times\left[\left(M_{\mathrm{i}} \times\right.\right. \left.\left.C N_{\mathrm{i}}\right)-\left(M_{\mathrm{f}} \times C N_{\mathrm{f}}\right)\right] /\left(M_{\mathrm{i}} \times C N_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$, where $M_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{f}}$ are the initial and final litter dry mass, respectively, and $C N_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $C N_{\mathrm{f}}$ are the initial and final C or N concentration (\% of litter dry mass). Using C loss (\%) rather than total litter mass loss allowed us to correct for any possible inorganic contamination of the litter retrieved from the field.
Analyses of diversity effects and statistical models. The net diversity effects, comprising complementarity and selection effects, on both C and N loss were calculated in species mixtures ${ }^{20}$. The net diversity effect was calculated as the sum of the complementarity and selection effects and contrasts the actual C and N loss observed for mixtures of plant functional types with that expected based on the C and N loss measured in single-species treatments. The net diversity effect represents the sum of synergistic or antagonistic interactions (that is, complementarity effects) and those due to the presence of a dominant species (that is, selection effects). Data were square-root transformed (keeping the original negative and positive signs
for the transformed values) to meet the assumptions for the analysis of variance of net diversity, complementarity and selection effects (see details below).

Analysis of variance models based on sequential sums of squares (type I) were used to assess the effects of diversity (the richness of plant litter functional types or the presence or absence of a given functional type and its interaction with other functional types), the completeness of the decomposer community (small, medium and large (complete)), the location across the latitudinal gradient and the ecosystem type (terrestrial versus aquatic) on percentage C and N loss. To ensure meaningful comparisons across the locations, several standardization methods were tested to remove any variation associated with the differences in incubation length. These methods included standardizing relative to the following: 1) a standard litter type from a non-native plant, Ailanthus altissima, that decomposed at all locations during the experiments; 2) the overall mean C or N loss per mesh size across locations; and 3) the mean C or N loss per mesh size of the rapidly decomposing functional type across locations. Because the results were consistent irrespective of standardization, the final model is presented using the non-standardized data.

The model terms were fitted to account for the dependency between the richness of plant litter functional types and the functional type composition (the presence or absence of a given functional type and interactions between functional types). First, functional type composition was partitioned into a contrast for richness and residual functional type composition (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 5). Second, as shown in Extended Data Table 7, we omitted the richness term and instead resolved the functional type composition into a full factorial analysis with contrasts for functional type presence or absence and interactions. In this model, the decomposer community was fitted as a log-linear contrast (small to large mesh size was expressed as the logarithm of the mesh size of the microcosms, which produced a linear relationship of the three mesh sizes). We also removed all of the other nonsignificant interaction terms in multiple successive model-fitting steps. These two alternative analyses reflect different partitionings of the functional type composition term into contrasts; they allowed us to compare the explanatory power of the richness contrast with the presence/absence contrast. A perfect linear richness effect would be found if all presence/absence contrasts had equal coefficients and did not interact. In this case, the mean squares or the richness effect with only one degree of freedom would be much larger than that of the combined mean squares of the presence/absence main effects of the four litter types with four degrees of freedom. In both models, the terms 'location' and 'ecosystem type' were tested at the block level. All other terms were tested against the residuals.

A similar analysis of variance approach was used to test independently for the effects of these same factors on complementarity and selection effects, as well as on net diversity effects (Extended Data Table 3). In a separate analysis of variance (Extended Data Table 8), we also tested whether the net loss of the total amount of N relative to the initial amount of N differed when litter of particular plant functional types (for example, rapidly decomposing litter and litter of N -fixing plants) decomposed together as opposed to decomposing separately, which we interpreted as an indication of N transfer between litter species. The location and ecosystem type were also included in this analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with $R$ software version 2.8.0.

Extended discussion on litter $\mathbf{N}$ transfer. Although our data suggest that N was transferred from the litter of N -fixing plants to rapidly decomposing litter, alternative mechanisms cannot be entirely ruled out. In particular, N incorporated into decomposing litter can originate not only from another co-occurring litter type but also from the N pool in the soil or stream water or from microbial N fixation ${ }^{32}$. However, N transfer from such alternative N sources does not readily explain the concomitant reciprocal changes that we observed between the litter of N -fixing plants and rapidly decomposing litter. Moreover, the idea that N transfer occurred between the two litter types is further supported by a positive net diversity effect on C loss that we observed only when these two particular litter functional types were both present (Extended Data Table 3). Additional support for our interpretation comes from ${ }^{15} \mathrm{~N}$ tracer studies in microcosms with tropical ${ }^{28}$ and temperate ${ }^{33}$ forest litter, which are proof of principle that active biological transfer of N through microorganisms, particularly saprotrophic fungi, can occur. Our large-scale field experiment suggests that this phenomenon might be widespread across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and across a wide variety of forest types and climatic conditions.

It had been proposed that N transfer is driven by a gradient in N concentration between litter types ${ }^{4,5}$, the rationale being that the element that limits the decomposition rate is N . However, the scenario now unfolding from our experiment (Fig. 3) and the recent isotope tracer studies under laboratory conditions ${ }^{28,33}$ is that N transfer is stoichiometrically controlled. The crucial determinant that defines the gradient along which N will be transferred in litter mixtures seems to be the demand for N relative to the availability of C (and possibly that of other elements critical for decomposer growth), rather than differences in the N concentration. A litter with high C quality favours rapid microbial growth, which in turn entails a high demand for N (and other nutrients), resulting in N acquisition from neighbouring nutrient pools. In extreme cases, the N source litter may even have a lower N concentration than the N sink litter ${ }^{33}$, provided that the C quality of both litter types is sufficiently different. In accordance with this mechanism, the decomposition of recalcitrant litter types in our study (slowly decomposing and evergreen plant functional types) was not accelerated by the presence of litter from N -fixing plant species (Extended Data Table 7), although those recalcitrant litter types had similarly low or lower initial N concentrations than the rapidly decomposing litter species, which consistently benefited from the presence of N-fixing plant litter.

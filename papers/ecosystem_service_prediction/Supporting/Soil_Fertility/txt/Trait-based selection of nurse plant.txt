re-integrate these artificial micro-deserts within the landscape matrix.  
2. We assessed the functional role of local nurse plant species and their traits to restore 
ecosystem functions related to soil fertility, soil microbial productivity and the 
reduction of abiotic stress. We sampled 30 metalliferous tailings in a mining district 
from semiarid Spain to detect nurse plant species and quantify their ability to 
promote essential functions from their establishment on the barren substrate up to 
the adult stage.

barren soils. Ten nurses further triggered a cascade of effects increasing soil fertility 
and microbial productivity and/or lowering soil abiotic stress.  
4. Plant species with larger life forms and longer periods of establishment since tailing 
abandonment contributed the most to the promotion of ecosystem functions. C4 
plant species developing root systems with lower intensivity and depth: laterality 
ratios, as well as leaves with lower carbon : nitrogen ratios (C:N) induced a faster 
recovery of ecosystem functions. 
5. Synthesis and applications. We propose a protocol for selecting key species to be 
used in restoration programs based on their ability to restore ecosystem functions 
under extremely stressful conditions. We encourage combination of multiple target 
species with complementary traits in order to reinforce the rehabilitation of 
ecosystem functions.

Introduction 
Metal mining creates waste tailings that function as micro-deserts which feature severe 
abiotic stresses imposed by high concentrations of trace elements, high conductivity, 
low pH, physical instability and scant soil and water resources (Conesa et al. 2006). 
Around 700 million tons of metalliferous wastes are laid down annually (Warhurst 
2000). These extreme environments, which hinder both the natural recolonization and 
human-driven restoration, yield very depleted ecosystem services that require 
innovative restoration strategies. Conventional mine-rehabilitation techniques (e.g. 
waste removal, dam building, on-site containment by sealing) have been usually the 
methods of choice (European Commission 2009), but are often expensive and either 
inefficient or difficult to apply due to geostructural risks and environmental restrictions 
(Tordoff et al. 2000; Conesa & Schulin 2010). Metal uptake by phytoextraction using 
hyperaccumulator plants is considered the most useful phytoremediation technique (Ali 
et al. 2013). Nevertheless, phytoextraction techniques need both of long-term programs 
so as to significantly decrease soil metal concentrations and ex situ disposal treatments 
of the extracted phytomass (Conesa et al. 2006). These limitations have encouraged the 
use of plants for stabilization of mine tailings, so-called phytoestabilization, to promote 
the ecological integration of mining structures within their surrounding landscape 
matrix (Tordoff et al. 2000; Conesa et al. 2006; Mendez & Maier 2008; Ali et al. 2013).

For mine tailings embedded into natural areas, phytoestabilization poses a cheap and 
environmentally friendly tool compared to conventional rehabilitation techniques. 
 
Plant species selection is essential for the success of rehabilitation technologies in mine 
tailings. Plant selection has evolved from the use of model hyperaccumulator plants 
(e.g. Festuca, Thlaspy or Trifolium) to locally adapted species in the last years (Tordoff 
et al. 2000; Mendez & Maier, 2008; Párraga-Aguado et al. 2013). Ideal functional traits 
sought for species selection focus on their ability both to establish and rapidly grow on 
barren substrates and to tolerate (but not accumulate) metals (Martínez-Fernández et al. 
2011). These functional traits typically characterise pioneer plants that show 
intermediate characters between stress-tolerant and ruderal species (Pierce et al. 2017). 
Pioneers, though very efficient in colonizing barren areas, do not necessarily promote 
the establishment of other plant species or enhance soil conditions (Lei & Duan 2008; 
Arocena et al. 2009). These limitations have been counteracted by the use of organic 
and/or physical amendments (Mendez & Maier 2008), although contrasting results have 
been reported regarding the improvement of soil structure and fertility, metal 
immobilisation or microbial productivity (Arco-Lázaro et al. 2015; Zornoza et al. 
2016). Moreover, organic amendments can enhance metal mobility through weathering 
and decomposition of organic residues in the long term (Tordoff et al. 2000; Mendez & 
Maier, 2008; Párraga-Aguado et al. 2013). Alternatively, we propose that the 
phytoestabilization can be improved by selecting and combining nurse plant species that 
not only act as pioneers but also facilitate the establishment of other plant species, 
ultimately promoting the plant-soil feedbacks that trigger essential ecosystem functions 
(sensu Hooper et al. 2005). This approach favours the facilitation over the inhibition or 
tolerance models of succession proposed by Connell & Slatyer (1977).

Nurse plants are stress-resistant species that colonize barren soils, develop isles of 
milder microclimatic conditions, and facilitate the growth beneath their canopy of less 
stress-tolerant plants. In natural abiotically stressful environments a wealth of nurse 
plants have shown to shape plant patches with increased  productivity and soil fertility 
compared with adjacent bare sites (Aguiar & Sala 1999; Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). 
Nurse plants may have specific traits that confer them the ability to i) tolerate abiotic 
stress and establish on barren soils, ii) transform the microclimate beneath their canopy, 
both reducing solar radiation and increasing water availability, and locally relaxing the 
abiotic filter, and iii) improve soil fertility by supplying litter and root exudates 
available to decomposers (Navarro-Cano et al. 2014). Beyond promoting plant 
recruitment, facilitation-driven plant communities may drive a cascade of benefits on 
ecosystem functions, including ecosystem properties such as the accumulation of 
organic carbon and nutrients in soils, and ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, 
reduction of metal concentration in soils and ecosystem stability (Pugnaire et al. 1996; 
Wang et al. 2014; Navarro-Cano et al. 2015). These ecosystem functions, though rarely 
taken into account, are fundamental for the successful phytostabilization of mine 
tailings (Mendez & Maier 2008). The use of nurse plants improves the success of forest 
afforestations on natural soils in dry areas (Gómez-Aparicio 2009). In mine tailings, the 
formation of islands of increased fertility that promote soil microbial activity has been 
recently shown (Párraga-Aguado et al. 2013), suggesting that the use of nurse plants can 
be an attractive option for the phytomanagement of these degraded environments.  
 
The Cartagena-La Unión Mining District (SE Spain) has been a main metalliferous area 
in Europe during the last two millennia (Conesa & Schulin 2010). The mining activity

was totally abandoned in 1991, leaving 89 mine tailings with high concentrations of 
heavy metals and metalloids (hereafter metal(loids)), that threaten the environmental 
and human health (García-García 2004). Nowadays, mine tailings are being colonized 
by plants from the surrounding natural matrix shaping a patchy structure that resembles 
that of facilitation-driven communities. This led us to hypothesize that local plant 
species might not only withstand these extreme conditions but also trigger the 
restoration of essential ecosystem functions through ecological facilitation (Pugnaire et 
al. 1996; Navarro-Cano et al. 2014, 2015). We further speculated that nurse plants may 
have ecophysiological and morphological functional traits that allow recruiting on 
barren polluted substrates and promote ecosystem functions related to the amelioration 
of soil fertility (organic carbon, nutrients) and soil microbial productivity (organic 
matter decomposition, nutrient cycling), and the reduction of abiotic stress 
(concentration of metal pollutants, pH, salinity). We analyzed gradients of plant size for 
each potential nurse identified in the study area, with the aims to: i) assess the ability of 
each nurse to promote soil fertility and microbial productivity, and reduce the abiotic 
stress associated with its growth, and ii) determine the functional traits of nurse plants 
that underlie the rehabilitation of the ecosystem functions. As functional diversity has 
proven to optimize many ecosystem properties (Hooper et al. 2005) we discuss how the 
trait-based selection of nurse plants and their combination to synergistically force the 
rehabilitation of multiple ecosystem functions can be a practical tool in 
phytostabilization programs so as to achieve an effective restoration that promotes 
ecosystem services, beyond the survival of planted species.

Materials and methods 
Study system 
The Cartagena-La Unión Mining District (Murcia, Spain; 30 S 689151 E, 4164433 N) 
ranges 5.000 ha of a low-altitude coastal mountain range. Climate is semiarid 
Mediterranean with 17.9ºC mean annual temperature, 316.3 and 762.2 mm mean annual 
precipitation and evapotranspiration respectively (data for 2005-2015). Metamorphic 
nappes, sedimentary and igneous materials shape the area, whose ores of iron, lead and 
zinc among other metals have been intermittently exploited for over 2000 years. Mine 
tailings from the refining process show high metal concentrations and electrical 
conductivity, negligible organic matter and occasionally acidic pH that hamper plant 
recolonization and restoration (Conesa & Schulin 2010).  
 
Vegetation sampling 
Mine tailings are covered by a sparse patchy vegetation <25% plant cover (Fig. 1). We 
defined plant patches as clustered communities growing beneath the canopy of a 
perennial plant that could potentially be a nurse plant. A nurse plant should be able, as 
per definition, to recruit on gaps and promote seedling establishment of third species as 
it grows by relaxing the abiotic filter (Navarro-Cano et al. 2015). We defined gaps as 
the open space adjacent to each patch, where isolated pioneer plants (and no adults of 
potential nurses) are observed. 
 
Nurse plants were identified by an in situ random sampling of perennial species. We 
performed a preliminary sampling across 30 mine tailings from the 2nd half of the XXth 
century, 22 of which had conspicuous vegetation beyond some scattered individuals. 
We detected 102 plant species able to recruit on the barren substrate, 16 of which had

other plant species growing beneath their canopy (Table S1). Out of these 16 potential 
nurses, we selected 13 species that were highly represented in the tailings (from 50 to 
>1000 individuals; Table S1). To discard that nurses were not improving soil conditions 
but establishing under fertile conditions, we compared main soil parameters in the gaps 
and beneath the seedlings of these 13 species (Table S2). Then, we performed an in-
depth sampling in spring 2015 focusing on the 13 potential nurses in seven mine tailings 
that showed the highest plant density for the selected species (Table 1; Fig. S1). We 
recorded the number of individuals growing underneath each nurse and in its adjacent 
gap in at least 30 randomly selected patches per potential nurse except for Lygeum 
spartum (28 patches) and Osyris lanceolata (16 patches), which did not have a 
sufficient number of individuals (Table 1). Gaps were delimited with a similar area and 
shape to their corresponding patches, and were systematically placed West of the patch 
at a distance equal to its mean canopy diameter. We sampled a total of 1286 plots, 
including 643 plant patches and adjacent gaps. 
 
We estimated the year at which each potential nurse species colonized each mine tailing 
(AGE) by analysing a time series (1948-2013) of high resolution (0.25-0.50 m) aerial 
digital orthophotographs (http://sitmurcia.carm.es/). 
 
Soil sampling 
We collected 106 soil samples (0-5 cm) on early May 2015 along the size gradients of 
all 13 potential nurse plants. To minimize the site effects along with size gradients, each 
nurse was sampled in a single mine tailing. Size gradients included soils in the gaps 
between plant patches, as well as soils underneath seedlings (1-2 year old, heigth <10 
cm), juveniles (>10 cm tall with no cues of reproduction) and adults (reproductive) of

each nurse. Specifically, we took soil samples from 93 plant patches that configured 
size gradients for all potential nurses and 13 samples in the open space across each 
gradient. The size of the patch was measured as its mean canopy diameter (Navarro-
Cano et al. 2015). Underneath each patch we took five soil subsamples, from 10×10 cm 
quadrats each that were located in the cardinal points and the centre of the patch, and 
subsequently mixed all subsamples into a ca. 1 kg sample. In small plants, where five 
subsamples could not be collected beneath the canopy, the total soil surface was 
sampled. The number of samples collected in each one of the seven mine tailings 
depended on the presence of studied nurses (mine tailing A=12 samples; B=10; C=10; 
D=18; E=8; F=8; G=42).  The number of samples taken to depict the nurse size gradient 
varied depending on the nurse life form: trees and shrubs (10 samples per species), 
perennial grasses (8) and dwarf shrubs (6). This different sample size aimed at 
balancing the sampling effort across the size gradients of nurse plants that can differ in 
their lifespan up to two decades in the study area. Unbalanced sample sizes did not 
cause differences across nurses in the soil studied parameters, as we repeated all the 
statistical analyses using balanced sample sizes (n=6) for all nurses and results were 
consistent (data not shown). Gap samples resulted from bulking the subsamples 
collected in the gaps adjacent to each patch. Soil samples were transported to the 
laboratory on ice, sieved ≤2 mm and kept at 4ºC during subsequent analyses. Main 
substrate properties in the seven tailings are given in Table S3. 
 
Soil fertility, microbial productivity and abiotic stress variables 
Soil gravimetric humidity (GH), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon 
(TOC) and nitrogen (TN) were measured using standard procedures as in Navarro-Cano 
et al. (2015). Soil total concentrations of other nutrients and heavy metals were

determined by digestion with HNO3 and H2O2, using an Ultraclave microwave digestion 
system (Milestone, Milan) followed by analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical 
Emission Spectroscopy (ICAP 6500 ICP-OES Spectrometer, Thermo Fischer Scientific, 
Waltham).  
Basal respiration (BR), indicative of the rates of organic carbon mineralization, was 
measured as the average C content respired daily per kilogram soil during a 30 day 
aerobic incubation assay. We quantified the production of CO2  from 30 g soil using an 
infrared analyser (Headspace CO2 analyzer 6700, Illinois Intruments Inc). We also 
quantified colorimetrically hydrolytic activities involved in carbon (β-glucosidase, GA), 
phosphorus (alkaline phosphatase, PA) and nitrogen cycling (urease, UA). Further 
details on all protocols are given in Navarro-Cano et al. (2014). 
 
Plant functional traits 
The functional role of the nurse plants on the rehabilitation of ecosystem functions was 
assessed by measuring morphological (life form, biovolume, pedestal height, root 
intensivity and root depth:laterality ratio) and physiological traits (photosynthetic 
metabolism, halophytism, leaf C:N ratio, leaf As and leaf Pb concentration). 
Information on trait values was either obtained from the literature or from five adult 
plants sampled in the tailings (Table S4). Life form was estimated from categories 
related with plant morphology and size (tree, shrub, perennial grass, dwarf shrub), 
assigned based on Paula et al. (2009) and the authors’ criterion. Plant biovolume was 
estimated from the plant height and major and minor canopy diameter. Pedestal height 
was defined as the elevation of soil beneath the nurse canopy resulting from sediment 
trapping, which depends on the aboveground plant architecture (branching type and 
density), and was estimated trigonometrically from its angle and length. Root intensivity

was estimated as the ratio between the fresh root length (maximum length of stretched 
roots) and the dry root weight (cleaned and 65ºC oven-dried roots) after digging up the 
whole root system. The root depth:laterality ratio was estimated by measuring the total 
laterality and depth of fresh roots. Both root traits have been used as indicators of soil 
exploration ability and competitive strength (Guerrero-Campo 1998; Cornelissen et al. 
2003). Photosynthetic metabolism (C3, C4 or CAM) and halophytism (a syndrome 
related to the ability to cope with high salinity) were obtained from the literature (Table 
S4). Leaf C and N was quantified as for soils from ca. 10 g of fresh ground leaves per 
plant. Leaf As and Pb were quantified in ground and digested samples, and analysed by 
ICP as above. These concentrations were used as cues of the accumulation and tolerance 
of toxic elements (Table S5).  
 
Statistical analyses 
Facilitation of beneficiary plant species by each potential nurse plant was analysed by 
Chi square tests, to explore whether the observed distribution of the total number of 
counted plant individuals underneath the nurse canopy and in the adjacent gaps differ 
significantly from the random expectation. The species-specific effects of the nurse 
diameter (taken as a continuous variable) on each variable associated with soil fertility 
(TOC, N, P, K and GH), microbial productivity (BR, GA, PA and UA) and abiotic 
stress (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, pH and EC) were tested by means of Generalised Linear 
Models (GLM) using the nurse diameter as the independent variable. For each nurse 
species the p-values in the 16 GLMs were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the 
Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control for the false discovery rate.

We performed three principal component analyses (PCA) to reduce the main groups of 
ecosystem functions to orthogonal variables in order to estimate the overall effects of 
the size gradient of each nurse species separately on soil fertility, productivity and 
abiotic stress (Fig. S2). The first PC resulting from the three individual PCAs was used 
as a dependent variable in separate GLMs. False discovery rates were controlled, as 
described above. 
 
To determine which functional traits of the nurse plants associate with the rehabilitation 
of soil fertility and microbial productivity, we assessed the role of the overall selected 
traits on the improvement of soil TOC, N, P, GA, UA and PA beneath the potential 
nurses. All trait values were reduced by PCA including quantitative and qualitative 
variables with the PCAmixdata R package (Chavent et al. 2014). We used the first and 
second dimensions as predictive variables in GLMs with ‘Soil improvement’ as the 
dependent variable and ’Mine tailing’ as a random factor in order to account for the 
effects of each one of the seven sampling sites. We measured the Soil improvement as a 
ratio, resulting from the division of the value of each soil variable at the final (largest 
patch) and starting (gap) points of each nurse size gradient. Finally, to provide a time 
integrated measure of the recovery period of soil properties beneath each nurse species, 
we used the colonization age (AGE) of each nurse as a predictor of Soil improvement as 
above. The p-values of these mixed GLMs were adjusted for multiple comparisons with 
the B-H correction. All analyses were performed with R 3.1.3 (R Core Team 2015). 
 
Results 
We detected 13 potential nurse plants among 102 species growing on barren mine 
tailings (Table S1), which included trees, shrubs, perennial grasses and dwarf shrubs

(Table 2). Eleven out of these 13 species actually functioned as nurse plants facilitating 
the recruitment of beneficiary species, as the plant abundance beneath their canopy was 
significantly higher than that in the adjacent gaps (Table 1).  
 
Effects of potential nurses on soil fertility, microbial productivity and abiotic stress 
Once we confirmed that nurse seedlings are established on barren substrate (Table S2) 
we tested if nurses positively shift the soil properties as they grow. The species-specific 
effects of the nurse diameter on the fertility, productivity and abiotic stress variables are 
shown in Table 2. Contrasting effects were found depending on the variable and nurse 
species. TOC was significantly improved by plant diameter in most trees and shrubs, 
excepting D. pentaphyllum, which actually did not act as a nurse according to our 
results. Three of these species (T. canariensis, O. lanceolata and A. halimus) also 
improved total N, and A. halimus even K. Among perennial grasses and dwarf shrubs, 
TOC levels only increased associated with the size of L. spartum and S. tenacissima. 
Similar patterns were found for soil microbial productivity (Table 2). A. halimus had 
positive effects on all productivity variables. Similarly, the trees T. canariensis and O. 
lanceolata and the grasses L. spartum, S. tenacissima and H. synaica significantly 
increased at least GA, PA and BR, whereas no dwarf shrubs had any effect on microbial 
productivity variables.  
 
Positive effects of nurses on abiotic stress variables were less frequent (Table 2). Only 
S. oppositifolia significantly increased soil pH (from 5.5 in the gaps to 7.5 underneath 
the largest patches) and concurrently decreased EC (2.0 to 0.5 dS·m-1). In contrast, this 
species increased soil As (150 to 350 mg·kg-1) and Pb (300 to 1000 mg·kg-1) 
concentrations beneath its canopy as it grew. Other species, such as O. lanceolata, A.

halimus and L. spartum also reduced EC. Only the grasses L. spartum and H. synaica 
reduced respectively soil Cd and Pb concentrations. 
 
The first principal components of three PCAs performed to reduce soil fertility, 
microbial productivity and abiotic stress variables (hereafter Fertility, Productivity and 
Abiotic stress) were used for further analyses (Fig. S2). Fertility explained 49.2% of the 
total variance and was positively correlated with TOC, N, P and K. Productivity 
(59.3%) was positively correlated with GA, UA, PA and BR. Abiotic stress (45.1%) 
was negatively correlated with EC and Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations. Fertility 
significantly increased with the nurse size only in some of the largest life forms as T. 
canariensis, O. lanceolata and S. oppositifolia (Table 2). Productivity significantly 
increased in the six largest nurse species (Table 2). Finally, Abiotic stress significantly 
decreased in A. halimus, S. oppositifolia and increased marginally in P. miliaceum 
(Table 2). Fig. 2 shows the evolution of soil fertility, microbial productivity and abiotic 
stress with the mean diameter of Osyris lanceolata for illustrative purposes. All other 
species can be found in Figs. S3 to S5. 
 
Identifying nurse functional traits related to ecosystem functions 
The reduction of ten functional traits of the nurse plants by PCA yielded a first 
dimension (TRAITS1) that explained 31% of the variance and was positively correlated 
with halophytism, trees and shrubs and the C4 metabolism (Fig. S6). TRAITS1 was 
negatively correlated with root intensivity, root depth:laterality ratio and leaf C:N ratio. 
Overall, TRAITS1 would be higher in larger species with adaptations to abiotic stress 
and an efficient metabolism and with higher root laterality and presence of secondary 
roots. The second dimension (TRAITS2) explained 26.2% of variance and was

positively correlated with the nurse biovolume and pedestal height, and negatively 
correlated with leaf As and Pb concentration. TRAITS2 would be higher in plants 
shaping significant canopies, that work as sediment sinks and foliar accumulator of 
metal(loids). TRAITS1 significantly and positively explained the improvement in soil 
TOC beneath the nurses (Fig. 3); Estimate ± SE value of the linear model; 0.29±0.09; 
t5=3.1, P =0.040), marginally explained N (0.46±0.21, t5=2.2, P =0.089) and GA 
(0.47±0.19; t5=2.4, P=0.088), and significantly PA (0.24±0.06, t5=3.8, P=0.023). 
TRAITS2 explained PA improvement (0.25±0.07, t5=3.6, P=0.023), marginally GA 
(0.54±0.23, t5=2.3, P=0.088) and N (0.22±0.10, t5=2.2, P =0.089). 
 
We finally examined the effect of the colonization age of the mine tailings by each 
nurse species (AGE) on the amelioration of ecosystem functions. AGE, even though a 
rough time estimate, was a good predictor of TOC improvement (0.08±0.02, t5=3.4, P 
=0.039; Fig. 5), N (0.08±0.02, t5=4.2, P =0.014), PA (0.05±0.02, t5=3.1, P =0.027), and 
marginally GA improvement (0.11±0.05, t=2.1, P=0.088). The shrub A. halimus 
improved TOC and N faster than the average, whereas S. oppositifolia similarly 
improved TOC faster than other species (Fig. 3).  
 
Discussion 
Our results show that nurse plants trigger the recolonization of metalliferous mine 
tailings under semi-arid conditions through the assembly of patchy plant communities 
and further promote essential ecosystem functions. Plant traits related to the type of 
metabolism and root system, as well as the nutrient ratios in the leaves, appear as the 
main determinants of the ability of a nurse plant to restore the ecosystem functions 
beyond the recruitment of beneficiary species in mining areas. We underline the role of

nurse plants as ecosystem engineers that promote ecosystem functions related to plant 
dynamics, soil properties and microbially-mediated processes in extremely stressful 
ecosystems. In line with previous studies (Wang et al. 2014; Dominguez et al. 2015), 
these results point out the use of plant-plant facilitation as an emergent topic in mine 
reclamation.  
 
The use of facilitation as a strategy to restore mining areas requires, firstly, an 
appropriate selection of the nurse species, and thus a clear differentiation between plants 
that are mere pioneers and those that can further facilitate less stress-tolerant species. 
The fact that metal tolerant species have been traditionally defined as pioneers can be 
associated with the idea that, under extreme conditions, the abiotic component of the 
species niche is the only determinant of species establishment and growth. This view 
ignores the biotic interactions that can potentially readjust the species fundamental 
niche, thus shaping the realized niche, as the final process of both abiotic and biotic 
filtering. Bruno et al. (2003) highlight that incorporating facilitation into the niche 
concept alters the notion of the realized niche, which can have a broader spatial range 
for beneficiary species than that predicted by their fundamental niche based on the 
nurse-driven habitat amelioration. In agreement with this approach, we included nurses 
and beneficiaries to the plant functional categories that colonize mine tailings. This 
classification allows detecting not only plant colonizers but also community assemblers 
and soil promoters that improve ecosystem functions as organic matter decomposition 
and nutrient cycling (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006; Navarro-Cano et al. 2015, 2016). A 
suitable functional categorization can be fundamental when the results have potential 
applications in restoration. Arocena et al. (2009) defined T. canariensis and P. 
halepensis as pioneers based on the incipient soil formation beneath their canopy, while

according to our results in the same study area both species are indeed nurses. Pioneers 
are usually early-colonizers that both resist abiotic stress (high EC, metal concentration 
and temperature) and are efficient competitors for soil resources, and thus can lead to an 
arrested plant succession (Walker & del Moral 2003). This is the case of some perennial 
grasses that show to effectively recover in post-mining areas but impede forest 
establishment (Hammond 1999; Winkler et al. 2014). In our study, most perennial 
grasses seem to facilitate the establishment of dwarf shrubby and annual Mediterranean 
semiarid communities (Table 1), but have a limited effect in triggering forest 
communities and little influence on soil fertility and productivity (Table 2 and Figs. S3-
S4). This type of succession follows the inhibition model described by Connell & 
Slatyer (1977), and we argue that other species that follow instead the facilitation model 
should be selected for restoration practices. 
 
Plant nursing ability might be ultimately determined by functional traits, which are the 
main drivers of community assembly and providers of ecosystem functions (De Bello et 
al. 2010, 2012). Therefore, finding out the set of traits that determine the capacity to 
facilitate other species and promote ecosystem functions is another relevant step in the 
selection of nurse species. Short- to mid-term shifts in soil properties are controlled by 
plant traits related with the production of leaf litter and root exudates, which are the 
fundamental resource for microbial decomposers and nutrient cyclers (Kellman 1979; 
Dakora & Philips 2002). Among the main traits that influence biogeochemical cycles 
(revised by Cornelissen et al. 2003), leaf traits are the most commonly assessed drivers 
of soil fertility and productivity shifts (De Deyn et al. 2008), whereas root traits are 
rarely assessed likely because seem to be more recalcitrant to decomposition (Kemp et 
al. 2003; de Bello et al. 2010). In Mediterranean environments, higher leaf litter

decomposition rates are positively correlated with leaf toughness and negatively with 
C:N ratios (Gallardo & Merino 1993). Besides root exudates and litter, root size and 
architecture can potentially influence soil fertility and stability (erosion control), and 
water regulation (De Baets et al. 2007; de Bello et al. 2010). The type of root system is 
also essential at the community level, since functionally complementary roots (e.g. 
spreading at different depths) allow a higher shared efficiency in the use of resources 
through reducing inter-specific competition (Blignaut & Milton 2005). A functionally 
dissimilar neighbourhood can potentially increase the amount of organic inputs to the 
soil (Spehn et al. 2000) and likely the abundance of soil microbes and detritivorous 
fauna (Milcu et al. 2013). Indeed, the nurse and its beneficiaries make a synergistic 
contribution to soil fertility and microbial productivity underneath multi-specific plant 
patches (Navarro-Cano et al. 2015). In our study system, halophytic and C4 plant 
species with larger life forms, with lesser root intensivity, root depth:laterality ratio and 
leaf C:N ratio were more effective in increasing soil TOC, N and P (Fig. 3). 
Halophytism and C4 photosynthetic metabolism are attributes that allow overcoming 
saline and water stress (Pyankov et al. 2010; Párraga-Aguado et al. 2014). Lesser root 
intensivity and depth:laterality ratio in trees and shrubs are trait expressions that might 
reduce water competition beneath the canopy by favouring functional complementarity 
with the shallower root systems from tiny plant species facilitated by the nurses 
(Guerrero-Campo 1998; De Baets et al. 2007). We also found that plant species with a 
larger biovolume, able to create higher pedestals beneath their canopy were more 
effective to promote C cycling, in agreement with the idea that dust trapping ability 
promotes the formation of fertility islands (Wezel et al. 2000). All these traits depict the 
ideal nurse in our tailings as a long-lifespan species with an aboveground architecture 
prone to retain soil particles and seeds, and enrich its canopy with labile leaf litter. This

model species also has belowground traits that minimize competition with its facilitated 
community. Ideally, this nurse species might contribute to reduce the metal 
concentration beneath its canopy without a significant accumulation in plant tissues. 
Nevertheless, the metal concentration patterns beneath the plant canopy are not always 
positively correlated, as in S. oppositifolia that significantly alleviates soil EC and Cd, 
and Zn but simultaneously increases As concentrations (Table 2 and Fig. S5).  
 
In order to give practical guidelines for restoration programmes in the studied mine 
tailings, we give a multifunctional scoring of nurse species based on their ability to 
improve ecosystem functions (Table 3). The results can be interpreted as a sequential 
decision making process translatable to any other ecosystem with preponderance of 
abiotic stress factors, e.g. mine areas in drylands, disturbed highlands, or abandoned 
marginal croplands prone to desertification. The decision process pursuits to detect 
nurse plants able to i) build multi-specific plant patches, ii) create fertility isles, ii) 
promote organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and iv) decrease soil abiotic 
stress. O. lanceolata and A. halimus had the highest global scorings, and so could be 
seen as the best species to positively affect the assessed ecosystem functions. This 
functional scoring could be also used to select the best nurse for a specific purpose in 
combination with data on the colonization age (if available). For instance, improvement 
in soil organic carbon and nitrogen respectively could be achieved with S. oppositifolia 
and A. halimus, which show soil improvement rates over the average (Fig. 3). 
Alternatively, our functional scoring could serve as a tool to choose different nurse 
species that might be combined to synergistically increase the community effects on 
global ecosystem functions. Our results illustrate how the trait-based selection of target

species can help to more efficiently design strategies to reach the aims of ecological 
restoration programs (in cost and time) in stressful ecosystems.

Table 3.  Multifunctional scoring of nurse species to support decision making for  
phytoestabilization programmes in the studied mine tailings, based on each species 
ability to nurse third species, increase soil fertility and microbial productivity, and 
reduce abiotic stress. The standardized difference between the initial value (barren soil) 
and the final value (beneath larger nurse) for each variable and species is shown (values 
ranging from -1 to 1). Non-significant effects are omitted. The global score for each 
species is calculated by summing all the individual abilities to restore ecosystem 
functions.

increased abiotic stress; for pH, negative values indicate higher acidity and then an increased 
abiotic stress; for EC, positive values indicate lower salinity which is interpreted as a decreased

Figure 1. Overview of two of the studied mine tailings in the study area. An acidic 
tailing with a S. oppositifolia patchy community (A), with dense annual communities 
beneath their canopies (B). A neutral tailing (C) with dominance of T. canariensis 
(central ring) and A. halimus (outer belt), in which several perennial species are 
colonizing the oldest A. halimus patches (D). 
 
Figure 2. Evolution of soil fertility, microbial productivity and abiotic stress with the 
mean diameter of Osyris lanceolata.  
 
Figure 3. Top graphs show the effects of the functional traits of nurse plants 
(TRAITS1) on soil TOC and N improvement. Linear fits are depicted. Species codes: L. 
carthaginense (Lica), P. miliaceum (Pimi), H. stoechas (Hest), P. suffruticosa (Pasu), 
D. pentaphyllum (Dope), H. sinaica (Hysi), S. tenacissima (Stte), L. spartum (Lysp), O. 
lanceolata (Osla), A. halimus (Atha), T. canariensis (Taca), S. oppositifolia (Saop). 
Bottom graphs show the effects of the colonization age of the mine tailing by the nurse 
species (AGE) on soil TOC and N improvement. Linear fits are depicted. Plant species 
above the fitting lines might be considered as fast improvers of TOC or N, whereas 
species below the lines would be slow improvers.

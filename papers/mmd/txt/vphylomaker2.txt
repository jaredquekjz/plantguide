a b s t r a c t
An earlier version of V.PhyloMaker has been broadly used to generate phylogenetic trees of vascular
plants for botanical, biogeographical and ecological studies. Here, we update and enlarge this package,
which is now called ‘V.PhyloMaker2’. With V.PhyloMaker2, one can generate a phylogenetic tree for
vascular plants based on one of three different botanical nomenclature systems. V.PhyloMaker2 can
generate phylogenies for very large species lists (the largest species list that we tested included 365,198
species). V.PhyloMaker2 generates phylogenies at a fast speed. We provide an example (including a
sample species list and an R script to run it) in this paper to show how to use V.PhyloMaker2 to generate
phylogenetic trees.

1. Introduction
Phylogenetic trees serve as tools that facilitate systematic,
evolutionary and ecological analyses (Smith and Brown, 2018). For
example, phylogenies have been used to address ecological ques-
tions (Beaulieu et al., 2012; Cornwell et al., 2014), evolution of
climate tolerance (Smith et al., 2009; Edwards and Smith, 2010;
Zanne et al., 2014), and diversiﬁcation (Smith et al., 2011). Since
Webb (2000) developed an approach for analyzing phylogenetic
structure of biological communities and used the phylogenetic
approach to address issues of community assembly two decades
ago, the use of phylogenetic trees to investigate patterns of com-
munity structure has blossomed (Qian and Jin, 2016; Jin and Qian,
2019).
There are about 357,000 vascular plant species in the world
(Freiberg et al., 2020) but only ~20% of these species have been
sequenced, according to gene sequence data with GenBank.
Because well resolved phylogenies that include all plant species of a
study area are rare, botanists and ecologists often use mega-tree
approaches to generate plant phylogenetic trees for their studies.
Zanne et al. (2014) published a phylogeny that includes 31,749
plant species. Qian and Jin (2016) developed an R package, S.Phy-
loMaker, to use an updated version of Zanne et al.’s phylogeny as a
backbone to generate phylogenetic trees for seed plants. S.Phylo-
Maker has been used in 232 published studies according to
Thompson Reuters ISI Web of Science (access on April 21, 2022)
(Fig. 1).
Smith and Brown (2018) published a phylogeny for seed plants
(i.e. GBOTB.tre), which includes 79,881 taxa at and below the
species rank. Jin and Qian (2019) updated and expanded this phy-
logeny by standardizing botanical nomenclature, removing dupli-
cate species, including pteridophyte species from Zanne et al.’s
(2014) phylogeny, and including those families that are missing
from the two phylogenies. The resulting phylogeny (i.e. GBOT-
B.extended.tre) includes 74,531 species of vascular plants in 10,587
genera (Jin and Qian, 2019). Jin and Qian (2019) developed an R
package, V.PhyloMaker, to use GBOTB.extended.tre as a backbone
to generate phylogenetic trees for vascular plants. V.PhyloMaker
has been used in 217 published studies according to Thompson
Reuters ISI Web of Science (access on April 21, 2022) (Fig. 1).

An update to this article is included at the end

Taken together, S.PhyloMaker and V.PhyloMaker have been used
in a total number of 449 studies, according to Thompson Reuters ISI
Web of Science (access on April 21, 2022) (Fig.1). The number of the
publications using the packages increases exponentially from 2016
to 2021 (Fig. 1), and these packages were used to generate plant
phylogenies in 180 published studies in 2021 alone (Fig. 1), sug-
gesting that the two packages have been considered as useful tools
to generate plant phylogenetic trees.
There is a drawback in S.PhyloMaker and V.PhyloMaker. Plant
names in the phylogenies implemented in both S.PhyloMaker and
V.PhyloMaker were standardized according to The Plant List (TPL;
http://www.theplantlist.org), which has been static since 2013. The
botanical nomenclature in TPL is outdated and 23% of plant names
in TPL are unsolved. Considering that several global plant databases
have been recently developed, it is time to update V.PhyloMaker by
improving its phylogenetic backbone so that it reﬂects the up-to-
date botanical nomenclature. Here, we present a new version of
V.PhyloMaker, which is called V.PhyloMaker2. In this new version,
in addition to retaining the phylogeny based on the botanical
nomenclature of TPL (we retain this phylogeny because TPL re-
mains to be widely used as a botanical nomenclature standardi-
zation source in the current literature; e.g. Kinlock et al., 2022), we
include two new phylogenetic backbones, one based on the
botanical nomenclature of the Leipzig catalogue of vascular plants
(LCVP) database (Freiberg et al., 2020), and the other based on the
botanical nomenclature of the World Plants (WP) database (https://
www.worldplants.de).
2. Package description
This package includes two major components: the R package
‘V.PhyloMaker2’, which included a set of functions and a set of data
ﬁles. Details about the package were described in the document
entitled “Introduction to the ‘V.PhyloMaker2’ package”, which was
provided along with the package (see below for website address),
and the document entitled “Descriptions of scenarios, functions
and data ﬁles.doc”, which is one of the supplementary ﬁles of this
paper. We focus on several key components of the package below.
2.1. The mega-trees
Three mega-trees were generated, each of which is in the
Newick format.
2.1.1. GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre
This mega-tree, which was based on the TPL nomenclature
standardization system, is the same as GBOTB.extended.tre in the
previous version of V.PhyloMaker reported in Jin and Qian (2019),
except for the following changes. (1) One genus (with a single
species, Agdestis clematidea) in the family Phytolaccaceae and one
genus (with two species, Dactylaena microphylla, D. pauciﬂora) in
the family Cleomaceae were separated from the other genera of
their respective families in GBOTB.extended.tre, causing these two
families being non-monophyletic. These two genera were removed.
(2) Eleven species in the ten genera (i.e. Acanthosyris, Cervantesia,
Comandra, Geocaulon, Jodina, Okoubaka, Pilgerina, Pyrularia, Scle-
ropyrum, and Staufferia) were placed in the family Santalaceae in
GBOTB.extended.tre, but they do not belong to the clade with all
other species of the family in GBOTB.extended.tre. These ten genera
belong to two families, Comandraceae (Comandra and Geocaulon)
and Cervantesiaceae (the other eight genera), which were placed in
the family Santalaceae in APG IV (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group,
2016) but were recognized as two separate families in some
botanical
literature
(e.g.
Flora
of
North
America
Editorial
Committee, 2016). We retained these ten genera in GBOTB.exten-
ded.TPL.tre but we placed them in Comandraceae and Cervante-
siaceae. The family Tiganophytaceae, with a single genus and a
single
species
(Tiganophyton
karasense),
was
established
by
Swanepoel et al. (2020) with the following phylogenetic relation-
ships with its most closely related families: (Koeberliniaceae(Ti-
ganophytaceae(Bataceae,Salvadoraceae))). We included the family
Tiganophytaceae in GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre based on the phylo-
genetic relationships reported in Swanepoel et al. (2020). We
estimated the divergence time of Tiganophytaceae (about 41.1
million years ago) based on data reported in Smith and Brown
(2018) and Swanepoel et al. (2020). As a result, GBOTB.exten-
ded.TPL.tre included 74,529 species of vascular plants in 10,597
genera and 482 families.
2.1.2. GBOTB.extended.LCVP.tre
This mega-tree, which was based on the LCVP nomenclature
standardization system, was generated as follows. (1) We extracted
the clade of pteridophytes from Zanne et al.’s (2014) phylogeny and
attached it to GBOTB from Smith and Brown (2018). The divergence
time between pteridophytes and seed plants was set according to
Zanne et al.’s (2014) phylogeny, as in GBOTB.extended.tre (Jin and
Qian, 2019). (2) We used the LCVP database (Freiberg et al., 2020)
to standardize spellings and nomenclature for the plant names in
the phylogeny, and removed duplicate plant names. (3) For those
families that were present in GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre but were
absent from the phylogeny derived from Zanne et al. (2014) and
Smith and Brown (2018), we added them to the phylogeny, based
on their locations in GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre. (4) As in GBOTB.ex-
tended.TPL.tre, we removed the genera Agdestis and Dactylaena
from
the
phylogeny.
Consequently,
GBOTB.extended.LCVP.tre
included 73,420 species of vascular plants in 10,134 genera and 482
families.
2.1.3. GBOTB.extended.WP.tre
This mega-tree was generated by following the same procedure
used to generate GBOTB.extended.LCVP.tre, except that the WP

2016) or V.PhyloMaker (Jin and Qian, 2019) in each year, based on Thompson Reu-
ters ISI Web of Science (access on April 21, 2022). The total number of the publications
using these two packages is 449.

database (https://www.worldplants.de) was used to standardize
spellings and nomenclature for the plant names in the phylogeny.
GBOTB.extended.WP.tre included 72,570 species of vascular plants
in 10,581 genera and 482 families.
A hybrid sign (, x, or X) in front of a genus name may cause a
problem when using V.PhyloMaker to generate a phylogeny.
Consequently, hybrid sign indicating a hybrid genus was removed
from each of the three mega-trees. Each hybrid species in each of the
three mega-trees was indicated with “X” (e.g. Abelia_X_grandiﬂora).
2.2. The V.PhyloMaker2 package
The V.PhyloMaker2 package contains three sets of functions and
data ﬁles, and each set of functions and data ﬁles work with one of the
three above-described mega-trees. The user chooses one mega-tree
from the three based on the user’s preference. The main function of
the package is phylo.maker. All other functions and data ﬁles were
shown inTable 1. Note that all functions are the same for the previous
version and this new version of the software and work for the three
mega-trees (Table 1). Descriptions for each type of functions and data
ﬁles are available in table 1 of Jin and Qian (2019) and in the “De-
scriptions of scenarios, functions and data ﬁles.doc” ﬁle in Supple-
mentary data with the present article. When the user loads
V.PhyloMaker2 in R by the command library ("V.PhyloMaker2"), all
functions shown inTable 1 are automatically loaded. The four types of
data ﬁles are the mega-trees, the dataframes withtip information (i.e.
tips.info) that contains the family and genus assignments of every tip
species in each mega-tree, and the two data frames (e.g. node-
s.info.1.TPL and nodes.info.2.TPL generated by build.nodes.1 and
build.nodes.2, respectively, based on the mega-tree GBOTB.exten-
ded.TPL.tre) that contain the genus- and family-level node and age
information of each mega-tree. The user determines whether the
function build.nodes.1 or build.nodes.2 is used to generate a phylogeny.
The phylo.maker function makes phylogenetic hypotheses under
three scenarios (i.e. S1, S2 and S3), which are the same three sce-
narios as in S.PhyloMaker (Qian and Jin, 2016) and V.PhyloMaker (Jin
and Qian, 2019), where details about the three scenarios are available
(also see the “Descriptions of scenarios, functions and data ﬁles.doc”
ﬁle in Supplementary data with the present article). The user de-
termines which scenario is used to generate a phylogeny. Of the
three scenarios, scenario 3 (i.e. S3) has been most commonly used.
The V.PhyloMaker2 package was written in RStudio (RStudio
Team, 2015), is for use in the R language (R Core Team, 2016), and
requires a standard installation of R and the ‘ape’ package (Paradis
et al., 2004). When the user loads V.PhyloMaker2, the ‘ape’ package
will be automatically loaded. The V.PhyloMaker2 package has been
tested by different users on different computers with different
versions of R (e.g. v.3.5.0, v.3.5.3, v.4.0.3, v.4.0.5, v.4.1.1, v.4.1.2,
v.4.1.3, v.4.2.0), and all the tests were completed with success. If the
user of V.PhyloMaker2 encounters a problem when installing the
package, the problem may be resolved when the user installs any of
the above-mentioned versions or a newer version of R.
V.PhyloMaker2 is an open-source package (published under
GPL-2). The R package of V.PhyloMaker2, together with documen-
tation, is available from GitHub (https://github.com/jinyizju/V.
PhyloMaker2). The package can be installed in R using the install_-
github function in the ‘devtools’ package (Wickham et al., 2018), as
follows, devtools::install_github("jinyizju/V.PhyloMaker2").
We included a sample species list (i.e. ‘sample_species_list.csv’)
in Supplementary data, which the user of V.PhyloMaker2 may use
as a sample species list to test this package. We provided an R script
in Box 1 to run V.PhyloMaker2 on the sample species list. The same
R script is also available in the ﬁle ‘R script to run V.PhyloMa-
ker2.txt’ in Supplementary data.
We tested V.PhyloMaker2 on a species list extracted from LCVP
(including 365,198 accepted species) on an HP EliteBook Laptop
with the following features: Windows 7 Enterprise; Intel® Core
(TM) i5-2540 CPU @ 2.60 GHz; 4 GB RAM; 64-bit Operating Sys-
tem). After running about 42 h, V.PhyloMaker2 successfully
generated a phylogeny for the species.
2.3. Preparation of species list for V.PhyloMaker2
A species list to be used by V.PhyloMaker2 should be in the
format of comma-separated values (csv) with ﬁve columns as
shown in the ﬁle ‘sample_species_list.csv’ in Supplementary data.
The ﬁrst three columns have to be ﬁlled and the last two columns
are optional. Because the spelling and nomenclature of species
names in each of the three mega-trees were standardized accord-
ing to its plant database (i.e. TPL, LCVP or WP), to maximize
matching in species names between the user’s species list and a
mega-tree chosen by the user, we suggest the user standardize
spelling and nomenclature of species according to the respective
plant database. All names in the user’s species list that are
considered as synonyms in the plant database should be replaced
with their accepted names in the plant database. Because taxa with
terminal branches in each mega-tree are species-level taxa (i.e.
binomials), infraspeciﬁc taxa (e.g. subspecies, variety, and forma) in
the user’s species list should be combined with their parental
species. Duplicate names should be removed. A hybrid sign in front
of a genus name should be removed, and a hybrid species should be
indicated with “X” (e.g. Abelia_X_grandiﬂora) to maximize the

matching of species names in the user’s species list and species
names in the mega-tree chosen by the user.
The ﬁle ‘family_list_for_V.PhyloMaker2.csv’ in Supplementary
data included a complete list of families of the world’s ﬂora of
vascular plants. All the families in this family list were included in
each of the three mega-trees with V.PhyloMaker2. Each species in
the user’s species list must be assigned with one of the families
shown in the family list. The relationships between genera and
families may be obtained from WP (https://www.worldplants.de)
for pteridophytes and gymnosperms, and from Angiosperm Phy-
logeny Website (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/)
for angiosperms. Species in the user’s species list that do not have a
family name in column ‘family’ will not be included in a phylogeny
generated by V.PhyloMaker2. For a species that is present in both
the mega-tree chosen by the user and in the user’s species list,
V.PhyloMaker2 will ignore the family name of the species in the
user’s species list.
Some species or genera that are absent from the mega-trees are
sister to or closely related with some species or genera in the mega-
trees. When the information of their closely related species or
genera is given in the user’s species list (columns ‘species.relative’
and ‘genus.relative’), these species or genera will be attached to
their closely related species or genera as sister species or genera in a
phylogeny generated by V.PhyloMaker2 (see Fig. 1 of Jin and Qian
(2019) for details).
3. Discussion
V.PhyloMaker2 is an updated and enlarged version of V.Phylo-
Maker published in Jin and Qian (2019). The major difference be-
tween the two versions is that V.PhyloMaker2 offers the user with
more options to generate phylogenetic trees based on different
botanical nomenclature systems. V.PhyloMaker2 is implemented
with three botanical nomenclature systems (i.e. TPL, LCVP, and WP).
Future versions of V.PhyloMaker may include more botanical
nomenclature systems.
Because V.PhyloMaker2 is largely based on the version of
V.PhyloMaker published in Jin and Qian (2019), we recommend the
user of V.PhyloMaker2 reads the article by Jin and Qian (2019).
When the user publishes the study based on a phylogenetic tree
generated by V.PhyloMaker2, we suggest the user cites both the
present article and the article by Jin and Qian (2019) in the user’s
publication. We also suggest the user cites the original articles of
the mega-trees (i.e. Zanne et al., 2014; Smith and Brown, 2018) and
the botanical nomenclature sources used in the mega-trees (see
above for details).
The
mega-trees
GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre,
GBOTB.exten-
ded.LCVP.tre and GBOTB.extended.WP.tre included 70%, 75% and
74% of all genera of vascular plants in TPL, LCVP and WP global
databases, respectively. Our empirical studies show that GBOT-
B.extended.TPL.tre commonly includes 85%e95% of all genera in a
regional or local species list (e.g. 87% for the seed plant ﬂora of
China, Qian et al., 2019; 94% for the Arctic ﬂora, Qian et al., 2022). A
recent study (Qian and Jin, 2021) shows that the results of a study
using a species-level phylogeny resolved at the genus level with
species being attached to their respective genera as polytomies is
nearly identical to the results of a study based on a phylogeny fully
resolved at the species level. Thus, phylogenetic trees generated by
V.PhyloMaker2 based on each of the three mega-trees are expected
to be robust for studies on community phylogenetics, and may be
used in other phylogeny-based studies.

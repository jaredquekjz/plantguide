**Abstract**
Comprehensively understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of ecosystem services is a prerequisite for maintaining the sustainable supply of ecosystem services.Plant functional traits directly participate in a variety of ecosystem processes,which in turn affect the supply of ecosystem services.Revealing the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services is an important way to understand the formation mechanism of ecosystem services.Based on a systematic literature review, 86 papers on plant functional properties and ecosystem services were retrieved in the Web of Science database,and data for 466 pairs of plant functional traits and ecosystem services and 83 plant functional traits were collected.The current status of research on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services was revealed.Moreover,the main plant functional traits that affect different ecosystem services and their mechanisms underlying their impacts were also demonstrated.The results show that the research on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services mostly focuses on natural ecosystems such as grasslands and forests.Most of these studies focus on ecosystem products providing and supporting services,including biomass,net primary productivity,and soil fertility.Based on the impacts of plant functional traits on different ecosystem services,the plant functional traits can be clustered into five categories:soil-conservation-related traits,water-cycle-related traits,ecosystem- multifunction-related traits,product-providing-related traits,and pollination-biocontrol-related traits.The impacts of climate change,human activities,and variations in spatial and temporal scales on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services need to be further explored.

Ecosystem services refer to the natural environmental conditions and utility of human beings that are formed and maintained by ecosystems and ecological processes (Daily, 1997; Ouyang Zhiyun et al., 1999). Human activities and the degradation of ecosystem services caused by climate change pose a huge threat to the sustainable development of human economy and society. Comprehensive understanding and understanding of the mechanism of ecosystem service formation is the prerequisite for protecting and improving ecosystem services (Ouyang Zhiyun and Zheng Hua, 2009). Understanding the relationship between ecosystem services and biodiversity is an important way to explore its formation mechanism (Cardinale et al., 2012; Wen Zhi et al., 2020). Based on the dominant vacation theory and the niche complementarity hypothesis, researchers have explored the relationship between a variety of biodiversity indexes (species diversity, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity) and different types of ecosystem services (such as biomass production, soil carbon sequestration, soil fertility maintenance, etc.) (Card-inale et al., 2006; Tscharntke et al., 2012; Bardgett \& van der Putten, 2014; Handa et al., 2014). However, there is still great uncertainty in explaining the mechanism of ecosystem service formation. For example, Staples et al. (2019)'s study on the Australian afforestation project found that biodiversity cannot effectively predict the biomass of ecosystems.


Pathways based on plant functional traits provide important perspectives and methods for revealing the mechanisms of ecosystem service formation (Diaz et al., 2007; Hillebrand\&Matthiessen, 2009). Plant functional traits refer to adaptive and effect characteristics that affect plant survival, growth and reproduction, reflecting the plant's response to the environment and traits that can affect the measurable function of the ecosystem (Violle et al., 2007; Liu Xiaojuan and Ma Keping, 2015). It can respond to changes in environmental factors and directly participate in ecosystem processes, affect the attributes and functions of the ecosystem, and thus affect ecosystem services (Eviner \&Chapin III, 2003; Balvanera et al., 2006). Lamarque et al. (2014) proposed the framework of "plant functional traits - ecosystem attributes or processes/functions - ecosystem services", revealing the important role of plant functional traits in the interaction and trade-offs of ecosystem services in the context of climate change and human interference, and providing important ideas for revealing the mechanism of ecosystem service formation. At present, a lot of research has been carried out at home and abroad on the "relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services", but the mechanisms are complex. One plant functional trait affects multiple ecosystem services. For example, the specific leaf area of ​​plants not only affects the net primary productivity of the ecosystem (Klumpp \& Soussana, 2009), but is closely related to the hydrological and temperature regulation services of the ecosystem (Everwand et al., 2014; Lundholm et al., 2015); the same ecosystem service is subject to multiple plants and is subject to multiple plants.


The combined effect of functional traits, for example, the ecosystem soil preservation service is controlled by multiple plant functional traits such as plant canopy density, leaf shape and size, root length density (Burylo et al., 2012a, 2012b; Serna-Chavez et al., 2017).


In order to clarify the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services, this article aims to explore the following two specific issues through a systematic literature review: (1) Based on plant functional trait pathways, what are the characteristics of current ecosystem service research? (2) What are the main plant functional traits and their influence paths that affect ecosystem services? This article also looks forward to the focus of future research on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services.



**1 Research Methods**

In order to quantify the research progress of the impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem services, we conducted a systematic literature search and analysis: First, we explored the characteristics of the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services from four aspects: number of publications, type of ecosystem, type of ecosystem service and research scale; second, we used bibliometric analysis methods to summarize the main plant functional traits that affect different types of ecosystem services; and explained the possible ways in which plant functional traits affect ecosystem services.



**1.1 Literature Search**

In order to expand the search results and improve the search efficiency, this study conducted two literature searches in the Web of Science core collection database: (1) On November 15, 2019, the topic search was conducted with the keywords "ecosystem services" and "plant functional trait" and the time range was defaulted to all years, and 496 documents were retrieved; (2) On March 4, 2020, the title contained "'biodiversity' or 'functional diversity' or 'plant functional trait' and "'ecosystem function (ing)' or 'ecosystem service' or 'ecosystem property' or 'biomass' or 'productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem product' or 'ecosystem property' or 'biomass' or 'productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem function' or 'ecosystem property' or 'ecosystem productivity' or 'ecosystem property' or 'eco 'production'or'oil organic carbon'or'carbon stock'or'decomposition'or'litter'or ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' � The literature of ltifunctionality'or'cultural' was searched and 2,237 documents were finally retrieved. In the literature screening, we first judged whether the title and abstract contain "biodiversity" at the same time by judging whether the title and abstract contain "biodiversity".


2237 documents were screened, and 1811 irrelevant documents were eliminated; then the content of the remaining 426 documents were screened, and 86 documents discussed the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services were finally obtained (Figure 1).


To reveal the overall characteristics and general pathways that plant functional traits affect ecosystem services, we selected ecosystem services with a number of studies higher than the overall number of studies $3 \%$ for further analysis, such as aboveground biomass, net primary productivity, soil organic carbon, hydrological regulation, temperature regulation, biological control, soil conservation, soil fertility, and pollination. These 9 ecosystem services can be classified into three categories: supply services, regulation services and support services (Table 1).



**1.2 Literature Analysis**

Classification and statistics of 86 literatures were conducted. First, based on the publication time, ecosystem type and research scale of each literature, we focused on recording the types of ecosystem services studied and plant functional trait indicators adopted in each literature. Finally, 83 plant functional traits were obtained (Table 2). Finally, 466 groups of evidence that individual plant functional trait indicators (such as community weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA) and functional differences in specific leaf area (FDSLA)) affect ecosystem services were obtained in the statistical paper. In the analysis of plant functional traits and their impact on ecosystem services, we calculate the frequency of plant functional traits that affect various ecosystem services and put the frequency higher than

**2 Research results**


**2.1 Research characteristics of the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services**

Based on the number of papers published, the type of ecosystem involved, the type of ecosystem services studied, and the spatial scale involved, the research on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services shows the following characteristics: (1) The relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services is an emerging research field. In 2011 and before, although the number of articles on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services has also increased year by year, it has grown slowly and the overall number is still small; after 2011, research results related to this topic have increased rapidly. This is related to the researchers' emphasis on the relationship between plant functional diversity and ecosystem services, as well as the publication of milestone articles on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services (Díaz et al., 2007; de Bello et al., 2010) (Fig. 2A). (2) Research on plant functional traits and ecosystem services is mainly based on natural ecosystems. Research on plant functional traits and ecosystem services is mainly focused on natural ecosystems, including grassland ecosystems and forest ecosystems, while less research has been conducted on agricultural and urban ecosystems, which may be because the formation mechanism of ecosystem services is more complex in natural ecosystems (Fig. 2B). (3) Most of the research focuses on services related to ecosystem nutrient circulation and material production, and ecosystem regulation services are relatively less concerned. The number of studies on the relationship between four ecosystem services and plant functional traits in biomass, soil organic carbon content, soil fertility, and net primary productivity of ecosystems accounted for $75 \%$ of the total number of studies, while the number of studies on ecosystem services such as ecosystem temperature regulation, biological control, soil conservation, and pollination accounted for about $25 \%$ of the total number of studies (Fig. 2C). (4) Discussion on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services


It is mainly concentrated on the ecosystem scale, and there are relatively few studies on the landscape scale and regional scale. The number of studies on the sample site scale accounts for more than $60 \%$ of the total number of studies, and 9 ecosystem services are studied on this scale. On other scales, researchers have different focus: on the landscape scale, they mainly focus on ecosystem services related to interspecies interactions, such as pollination and biological control services (Zirbel et al., 2017; Bartual et al., 2019); on the regional scale, they focus more on the impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem biomass and primary productivity; in control experiments, researchers mainly explored the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services through gradient experiments (Schin-dler\&Gessner, 2009; Patoine et al., 2017) (Fig. 2D). (5) The impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem services is complicated. The same trait can affect multiple ecosystem services. The same ecosystem service is affected by multiple plant functional traits. However, the same plant functional traits have different degrees of impact on different ecosystem services. For example, the functional traits of plant flowers (such as flower height, nectar type, and color) mainly affect crop pollination services and biological control services, while the impact on other services is extremely small (Figure 3). According to the degree of impact of plant functional traits on different ecosystem services, plant functional traits can be divided into 5 categories: soil maintenance service-related traits, water circulation-related traits, multifunctional related traits, product service-related traits and nutrient cycle-related traits, and pollination-related traits (Figure 3).



**2.2 The impact of plant functional traits on supply services**

Supply services refer to various products necessary for humans to survive and develop from the ecosystem (such as wood production, fibers and fuels). Biomass and net primary productivity can be used as the main indicators of supply services in terrestrial ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Board, 2005; de Bello et al., 2010). Plant functional traits affect the ecosystem's net primary productivity and biomass by affecting the ecosystem's photosynthesis process and nutrient allocation process. Economic traits such as specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content and other economic traits have an important impact on the photosynthetic rate of the ecosystem, and the maximum plant height, wood density and seed quality determine the growth and prosperity of the plant.

\end{figure}

The nutrient allocation strategy of colonization is an important factor affecting the biomass accumulation of ecosystems (Westoby, 1998; Golodets et al., 2009).


From the perspective of biomass, the main functional traits that affect the supply of services include the maximum height of the plant, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, wood density, leaf area and leaf dry matter content, etc. (Figure 3). Evidence from mature forest ecosystems shows that the maximum plant height is the indicator of plant functional traits that affect the strongest biomass (Adair et al., 2018), and that the wood density of plants also affects the accumulation of ecosystem biomass (Falster et al., 2011); and for ecosystems during succession, biomass is significantly positively correlated with the diversity of plant leaf nitrogen content (Conti \&Díaz, 2013; Zuo et al., 2016), which is inversely proportional to leaf carbon content and specific leaf area (Yang et al., 2019); in grassland ecosystems, higher specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and lower leaf dry matter content help improve the biomass of grassland ecosystems (Grigulis et al., 2013).


From the perspective of net primary productivity, the plant functional trait indicators that affect the supply service mainly include: plant leaf nitrogen content, maximum height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf phosphorus content, and stomatal conductivity (Figure 3). In grassland ecosystems, differences in leaf specific leaf area and dry matter content diversity have strong explanatory power for changes in net primary productivity of ecosystems (Klumpp \&Soussana, 2009); while in agricultural ecosystems, the maximum height of plants is related to the ecosystem


Net primary productivity has a weak negative correlation (Lienin\&Kleyer, 2012); higher leaf nitrogen content can promote the utilization efficiency of light energy to improve the net primary productivity of the ecosystem (Quétier et al., 2007); in wetland ecosystems, blade thickness has a strong correlation with the net primary productivity of the ecosystem (Fu et al., 2014); and some studies have shown that in control experiments, leaf resilience also affects the net primary productivity of the ecosystem (La Pierre\&Smith, 2015); but increased seed mass will reduce the productivity of the underground part of the ecosystem (Zirbel et al., 2017).



**2.3 The impact of plant functional traits on regulating services**

Regulation services refer to the regulation effects of the ecosystem on the human living environment during the maintenance of energy flow and material circulation (such as flood regulation, climate regulation, pest control, water purification, etc.). At the ecosystem scale, soil organic carbon, hydrological regulation, temperature regulation, soil maintenance and biological control are usually used as the main indicators of regulation services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Board, 2005; de Bello et al., 2010). Plant functional traits affect soil organic carbon storage by affecting material production and root metabolism, affect hydrology and temperature regulation services by changing canopy structure, affect ecosystem soil conservation functions by changing the surface and underground structure of the ecosystem, and affect biological control functions by changing habitat conditions.


In terms of soil organic carbon storage, the main factors affecting regulation services

The plant functional trait indicators include the maximum height of the plant, leaf nitrogen content, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, wood density, leaf carbon content, etc. (Figure 3). Research shows that the maximum height of plants is an important influencing factor of canopy growth rate, and can increase soil organic carbon content by promoting canopy growth (Conti \&Díaz, 2013; Lundholm et al., 2015); in forest ecosystems, the weighted average value of leaf leaf mass in plant communities is positively correlated with soil organic carbon storage, while the reduced leaf mass diversity will reduce soil organic carbon storage (Adair et al., 2018). In addition, soil organic carbon content


The amount is positively correlated with wood density in plant communities, but negatively correlated with specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content (Lin et al., 2016); in agricultural ecosystems, high leaf nitrogen content can promote soil organic carbon storage (García-Palacios et al., 2018); in grassland ecosystems, plant leaf specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content diversity can explain the change rate of soil carbon storage $48 \%$ (Klumpp \& Soussana, 2009); it is worth noting that soil organic carbon content is also highly correlated with relatively longer than roots, root diameter and root tissue density (Garcia et al., 2019).


In terms of hydrological regulation, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect the regulation service include: plant maximum height, specific leaf area, life type, wood density, leaf life and leaf tissue density, etc. (Figure 3). Plant canopy density and fine root percentage have important influence on ecosystem hydrological regulation services (Wen et al., 2019); ecosystem rainwater capture capacity is mainly affected by plant height and canopy structure (Lundholm et al., 2015); leaf specific leaf area and leaf thickness have a strong positive correlation with community evaporation (Everwand et al., 2014); and leaf porosity conductance is a direct influencing factor affecting plant community evaporation, and due to the influence of plant moisture retention and carbon absorption tradeoffs, its impact degree varies dramatically between different seasons (Everwand et al., 2014; Matheny et al., 2017).


In terms of temperature regulation, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect the regulation service include: plant maximum height, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, canopy structure, and leaf stomatal conductivity (Figure 3). In urban roof greening, plant communities with high stomatal conductivity and canopy density have a more obvious cooling effect during the day and also have a better insulation effect at night (Monteiroa et al., 2017); the specific leaf area and height of plants also indirectly affect the temperature regulation function of the ecosystem by affecting the canopy density of vegetation (Lundholm et al., 2015), while the research results of Lundholm et al. (2014) show that there is only a weak positive correlation between plant height and temperature regulation.


In terms of soil conservation, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect support services include: plant leaf area, root diameter, stem material content, and stem projection area (Figure 3). In the above ground part, the shape and size of the plant leaf will also affect the interception ability of the sediment, and the leaf roundness index and size are proportional to the amount of sediment intercepted (Burylo et al., 2012a); while in the underground part, the soil erosion intensity is significantly positively correlated with the diameter of the plant roots, and it also has a certain correlation with the length of the root, the density of the roots, and the outer surface area of ​​the root system (Burylo et al., 2012b). Evidence in semiarid grasslands also suggests that communities with smaller root diameters have a positive effect on ecosystem soil preservation (Zhu et al., 2015).


In terms of biological control, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect the regulation service include: plant flowering time, plant maximum height, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, flower pattern, flowering period length, nectar type and flower color, etc. (Figure 3). Many studies have shown that the diversity of functional traits in plants has a positive effect on ecosystem biological control (Hatt et al., 2017; Santala et al., 2019); the color and UV reflectivity of flowers are important traits that attract insects. Compared with white and purple flowers, yellow flowers can attract more parasitic pests, but pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) are more likely to be high in ultraviolet rays.


The reflective flowers are attracted to them, and the availability of nectar also affects the attractiveness of plants to insects (Hatt et al., 2018); plants in late blooming can avoid the peak period of pests and reduce pest hazards (Lundin et al., 2019); in addition, plant functional traits that affect plant leaf palatability, etc., which have a strong correlation with the species and number of plant-eating insects (Stor-key et al., 2013).



**2.4 The impact of plant functional traits on support services**

Support services refer to services that support the supply, regulation and cultural services formation and maintenance of ecosystems (such as soil fertility and nutrient circulation, soil formation and maintenance, pollination, etc.). In terrestrial ecosystems, support services can use soil conservation, soil fertility and pollination as the main indicators of support services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Board, 2005; de Bello et al., 2010). Plant functional traits affect ecosystem soil fertility by affecting the ecosystem material decomposition process and plant root metabolism, and provide habitat conditions to pollinators to ensure pollination services.


In terms of soil fertility, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect support services include: plant maximum height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf nitrogen content, etc. (Figure 3). The diversity of leaf carbon and nitrogen content can promote litter decomposition, thereby increasing soil fertility (Handa et al., 2014), and lower leaf dry matter content can also promote litter decomposition (Quétier et al., 2007); while studies in arid areas show that the weighted average of plant communities in specific leaf area is one of the best predictors of soil carbon and nitrogen content (Zuo et al., 2016). In terms of plant root system, the distribution morphology and maximum root depth also have a great impact on soil fertility. Generally speaking, species with low lateral root decomposition rates are more conducive to improving soil fertility (Navarro-Cano et al., 2018).


In terms of crop pollination, the main plant functional trait indicators that affect support services include: flowering strength, flowering time, flower pattern, flower color, nectar type, flowering period length, flower height, etc. (Figure 3). Flower height and nectar concentration are strongly correlated with insect attraction. The attraction of pollinators to plants is positively correlated with the height and nectar concentration of flowers, and is negatively correlated with the reflection spectrum of flowers and the diversity of flowers shapes (Fornoff et al., 2017); some studies have also shown that the area of ​​flowers and flowering periods can also affect the attractiveness of plant communities to pollinators (Lundin et al., 2019); and on the landscape scale, configuring plants that coexist with multiple living types, multiple flower types and flowering periods plays an important role in maintaining ecosystem pollination services (Robleño et al., 2018).



**3 Research Outlook**

At present, the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services is centered around


, a series of research progress has been made, which show that the functional trait pathway of plant deepens the understanding of ecosystem service formation mechanisms. However, due to the diversity and complexity of plant functional traits themselves and the spatiotemporal and spatial-temporal characteristics of complex ecosystem services, there are still many problems that need to be solved in the research on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services. The specific issues in the following four aspects are worth further in-depth discussion.



**3.1 The influence of plant functional traits on ecosystem multifunctionality**

Ecosystem multifunctionality means that ecosystems often provide multiple ecosystem functions and services at the same time (Hector \&Bagchi, 2007). Generally speaking, with increasing biodiversity, ecosystem multifunctionality tends to show stronger growth effects than individual ecosystem services (van der Plas, 2019), but studies have also shown that this growth effect depends largely on the ecosystem functions or services selected in the ecosystem functional diversity indicators (Allan et al., 2015). Therefore, revealing the impact of biodiversity on ecosystem multifunctionality or multiple ecosystem services based on plant functional trait pathways (Lu et al., 2014) is crucial to further understand the complex relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services.



**3.2 Effects of plant functional trait correlation on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services**

Plant functional traits are the adaptive characterization of different plants under various environmental conditions. There are complex interactions and functional relationships between different plant functional traits, and there are significant correlations between different functional traits (Wright et al., 2004; Bin et al., 2019). However, there are huge differences in the ability of interpreting ecosystem services between different plant functional traits with correlations (Hu et al., 2019). For example, Pakeman et al. (2011) studies have shown that the nitrogen content of leaves has a significant negative correlation with the dry matter content of leaves, but the dry matter content of leaves explains the decomposition rate of litter is much higher than the nitrogen content of leaves. Therefore, studying the correlation between plant functional traits and clarifying the main plant functional traits and their impact paths that affect different ecosystem services is an important task to reveal the impact mechanism of the correlation between plant functional traits on ecosystem services. In addition, in order to clarify the complex connections between plant functional traits and their coordinated changes in different communities, He et al. (2020) proposed Plant Trait Networks, which provides an important idea for exploring the impact of the correlation of plant functional traits on the relationship between multiple functions of ecosystems.



**3.3 The impact of climate change and human activities on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services**

Climate change and disruption of human activities are the two key factors affecting global ecosystems (Wen Zhi et al., 2020). Plant functional traits and vegetation


Systemic services are affected by factors such as climate and human activities: on the one hand, climate change and human activities can directly affect the formation and supply of ecosystem services (Zheng et al., 2019); on the other hand, climate change and human activities can also change plant functional traits and affect the functional composition of ecosystems (Schröter et al., 2005; Tecco et al., 2010). However, complex climate change and human activities have led to huge uncertainty in the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services, and it also increases the complexity of the mechanism of the impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem services. Therefore, it is crucial to study the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services under different climatic conditions and gradients of anthropogenic interference factors to reduce the uncertainty of the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services.



**3.4 Spatial-temporal and spatial scale characteristics of the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services**

Research on ecosystem processes and services relies on specific spatial and time scales (Ouyang Zhiyun and Zheng Hua, 2009). However, the study on the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services faces great challenges on larger spatial scales and longer time scales. On the one hand, the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services on the ecosystem scale is difficult to generalize to the regional scale; on the other hand, ecosystem services and plant functional traits not only change between years, but may also change within a year or even a day. Therefore, linking individual plant functional traits with macroecosystem services is an important part of promoting its time and space scale. He et al. (2019) believe that ecosystem traits can correlate and integrate field surveys, eddy current observations, remote sensing big data, and ecological models, which is an effective way to associate traditional plant functional traits to macroscopic scales, and also provides important ideas for revealing the spatio-temporal and spatial scale characteristics of the relationship between plant functional traits and ecosystem services. In addition, it is necessary to establish a multi-scale, long-term observation platform to establish a spatial grid database of plant functional traits and ecosystem services (Kattge et al., 2011; Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2015), thereby providing evidence for revealing the mechanisms in which plant functional traits affect ecosystem services (Willemen, 2020).

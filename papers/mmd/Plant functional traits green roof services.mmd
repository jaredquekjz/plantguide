5 ABSTRACT: Plants make important contributions to the services provided by engineered ecosystems such as green roofs. Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were

predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Constructed ecosystems such as treatment wetlands, green roofs, and biowalls are engineered to provide ecosystem services. These services depend on the presence of living plants and engineered components such as growing medium, membranes, and subsidies such as irrigation. ${ }^{1-3}$ Green roofs can reduce heat transfer through building roofs, ${ }^{4}$ retain stormwater, ${ }^{5}$ trap airborne particulate matter, ${ }^{6}$ sequester carbon, ${ }^{7}$ and provide habitat, ${ }^{8}$ amenity, and aesthetic values. ${ }^{3}$ Plant species and vegetation types differ in their ability to provide these services; ${ }^{3}$ thus, careful selection of plant species can optimize green roof functioning. Green roofs often feature extreme conditions relative to local natural ecosystems, including shallow soils and high winds; thus, plant selection is also important to ensure survival of green roof vegetation. There are thousands of plant species in each region that can be used on green roofs, ${ }^{9}$ yet screening all these would be logistically impossible; hence, there is a need for an efficient way to characterize plants based on general traits that predict their function in a green roof setting.

Plant functional traits can be used to categorize species based on their effects on ecosystem processes. ${ }^{11,12}$ The plant trait approach highlights ecological function regardless of geographic distribution, taxonomic/phylogenetic relationships, and environmental niche and thus represents a general method to screen plant species for various purposes. Traits related to plant size and leaf morphology are relatively easy to measure, and relate to general plant strategies that differentiate species having evolved under different environmental conditions: plants that are shorter, with lower maximum growth rates, are typically found in areas with low soil fertility. These traits, in turn, can predict or influence ecosystem processes such as primary production, nutrient and water uptake, and transpiration rate ${ }^{10,11}$ but have
seldom been used in environmental engineering. For example, 52 specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area/dry weight, tends to be higher 53 for plants with relatively high growth rates, that inhabit relatively 54 fertile areas. SLA can be considered a "soft" trait that does not 55 directly drive ecosystem process rates but is correlated with 56 variables more closely associated with function, ${ }^{11}$ such as net 57 photosynthetic capacity and maximum growth rate, which in turn 58 can drive ecosystem productivity. Functional traits have been 59 used recently in green roof studies to select plants appropriate 60 for local climates, ${ }^{13}$ to predict growth rates, ${ }^{14}$ and to maximize 61 survival and stormwater retention. ${ }^{15}$ This ecological approach 62 uses traits measured in natural populations as indicators of 63 generic plant strategies and employs these traits to predict 64 ecosystem functions in different situations. The current study is 65 the first to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the 66 relationships between multiple ecosystem services provided by 67 green roofs and generic plant traits.

\section*{- METHODS AND MATERIALS}

The green roof site was on the Saint Mary's University campus, 70 approximately five meters above ground level and circum- 71 scribed by buildings one to three stories higher on all sides 72 (Appendix S1, Supporting Information). The climate of Halifax 73 is cold, humid, and maritime (Appendix S1). We used 74 measurements of ecosystem properties and services from two 75 previously established experiments in the same modular green 76 roof system, comparing species grown in monoculture in the 77

same growing medium on the same site. ${ }^{14,16-18}$ Plant species were selected from harsh environments that have similarities to green roofs (Appendix S1). Experiment 1 involved the establishment of 13 species in 2007, ${ }^{14,16}$ three modules per species ( $n=3$ ) (Table 1) (planting details in Appendix S1). Each replicate module was a black plastic nursery tray ( $36 \mathrm{~cm} \times 36 \mathrm{~cm} \times 12 \mathrm{~cm}$ ), with a free-draining base, lined with a composite nonwoven water-retention layer (Huesker Inc., Charlotte, NC), followed by an Enkamat (Colbond Inc., Enka, NC) drainage/filter layer which was topped with growing medium (Sopraflor X, Soprema Inc., Drummondville, QC, Canada) to a depth of approximately 6 cm (above the Enkamat). ${ }^{16}$ All modules were weeded throughout the experiment to remove volunteer species.

Canopy density, considered an "ecosystem property" here (number of contacts with live plant parts $/ 0.07 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ ), was determined in each module using a three-dimensional pin frame ( $36 \mathrm{~cm} \times 36 \mathrm{~cm} \times 36 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) with 16 pins. The total number of contacts between live plant parts and the pins was recorded, and data from the 2010 biomass peak (taken in August). Canopy growth rate incorporated canopy density measurements at the end of the growing season (August) in year 1 (2007) and year 2 (2008) to calculate the change in density as a rate, relative to initial density: $\ln \left(\right.$ density at $\left.t_{2}\right)- \ln$ (density at $\left.t_{1}\right) /$ number of days between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$. Albedo was quantified by placing modules one-by-one on a gray colored weed barrier fabric (Quest Plastics Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada). A single LI-COR pyranometer sensor and LI-250A light meter (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) was affixed to a retort stand, with the sensor and light meter 35 cm above the upper edge of the module. Under clear sky conditions within 1 h of solar noon incoming and reflected radiation were measured in August 2010, within 1 week of canopy density sampling. Incoming radiation ( $\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) was measured by directing the pyranometer sensor toward the sky ( $180^{\circ}$ away from the module), and reflected solar radiation was measured by facing the sensor directly at the module surface. These are relative measurements with validity only within our green roof system and were taken to compare relative reflectivity of the different plant species in monoculture (Appendix S1).

An index of water loss rate was derived from water addition experiments during the growing season of 2010: modules were weighed using a PX-Series Checkweighing bench scale (ATRON Systems Inc., West Caldwell, NJ), 1.3 L of water was added to the substrate (representing a medium-sized rain event for the region, equivalent to 10 mm of rain), by slowly pouring the water at the base of the vegetation layer, slowly moving the container so that the water would end up equally distributed across the surface. Modules were reweighed 10 min later to determine "stormwater capture" as the difference between pre- and postwatering weights, twice between June-August. Modules were reweighed 24 and 48 h later with the difference between postwatering weights and weights 24 or 48 h later used as an index of water loss (Appendix S1). These experiments were carried out on sunny days within 1 h of solar noon. Ten unplanted control modules were established and integrated with the planted modules at the start of the experiment in 2007 (Appendix S1). Indices of relative water capture and loss were created for each planted module each time the experiment was performed by dividing the planted module value by the average of the control (unplanted) modules in the same block.

Indicators of ecosystem services were quantified during the 2010 growing season. The effect of vegetation on substrate
temperatures during summer indicates a cooling service: lower 141 substrate temperatures are linearly correlated with lower net 142 heat flux into the building. ${ }^{16}$ To create an index that can be 143 used to compare vegetation at different times with variation in 144 ambient air temperatures and insolation, we calculated an index 145 of relative cooling by dividing the substrate temperatures in 146 planted modules within 1 h of solar noon on a sunny day ${ }^{16}{ }_{147}$ (once in May, once in July) by the average substrate 148 temperature of the control modules in the same block at the 149 same time (measurement details in Appendix S1). Three 150 variables related to soil chemistry services were calculated for 151 experiment 1 . Growing medium samples ( 250 mL per module, 152 Appendix S1) were collected at the end of the growing season 153 (September 2010) and assessed for organic matter content 154 (\%)(loss on ignition), nitrate-N (ion-specific electrode), and 155 phosphate ( $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}$ ) (Mehlich 3 extraction, inductively coupled 156 argon plasma), and were again converted to indices of relative 157 content by dividing planted module values by the average 158 value of control modules in the same block. Organic matter 159 content was included as an index of the ability of green roof 160 vegetation to increase carbon storage over time; ${ }^{7}$ soil nutrient 161 concentrations were included, as greater nutrient uptake by the 162 vegetation may be associated with higher runoff water quality, ${ }^{19} 163$ so lower nutrient concentrations were assessed as indicating 164 higher performance of nutrient removal services. 165

In 2009 we set up experiment 2, involving 10 replicates each 166 of 12 species and an unplanted control using the same modular 167 system as the previous experiment ${ }^{17,18}$ (four of these species 168 were also in experiment 1) (Appendix S1). Canopy growth 169 rate was determined for the first two years of growth as in the 170 other experiment. Substrate temperature was measured in the 171 same way as in experiment 1 during the same growing season 172 (2010) in May, July, and August. The stormwater capture 173 trials were performed three times between June-August 2010. 174 Snow depth was quantified as it impacts substrate temperature 175 and heat flux in winter and is affected by vegetation. ${ }^{18}$ As an 176 ecosystem property, we used average snow depths when 177 there was snow coverage from January 7-March 7, 2011178 (Appendix S1). As experiment 1 was harvested and soil 179 nutrients quantified at the end of the growing season in 2010, 180 we could only examine winter performance for experiment 2.181 Snow depths were used to represent the general effect of the 182 species monocultures on the differential accumulation of snow 183 on the substrate surface. In winter, net heat flux out of the 184 building is negatively correlated with substrate temperature, ${ }^{18}{ }_{185}$ so we used the minimum substrate temperature recorded be- 186 tween November 5, 2010, and March 31, 2011 (Appendix S1) 187 and divided by the average minimum of the control modules in 188 the same block as an index of "heat trapping" in winter (higher 189 minima represent less heat lost in the winter). The experiment 190 2 modules were used in a subsequent experiment so substrate 191 was not extracted and analyzed for nutrients and organic matter. 192

For indices that were measured more than once, we used the 193 temporal average for each module. We then took an average of 194 all modules of that species for each variable representing an 195 ecosystem property or ecosystem service for use in multiple 196 regression analyses. Indicators of ecosystem services for 197 which lower values indicate greater performance (e.g., a lower 198 substrate temperature in summer indicates greater cooling 199 ability of the vegetation, so replicates with cooler substrates 200 registered low indices relative to controls) were first reflected 201 (multiplied by -1 ) so that higher performance would register 202 as a higher value. This was performed for the "substrate 203

Plant traits are usually measured on plants growing in typical 206 environmental conditions in field settings, so that trait values 207 are representative of natural populations. ${ }^{20}$ To determine plant 208 traits for each species used in these experiments, five leaf samples 209 per species were obtained from different individuals growing 210 in their natural habitats (Appendix S1). Following established 211 protocols, ${ }^{11,20}$ healthy, fully expanded leaves from well developed 212 plants were selected (Appendix S1). Within 2 h of collection 213 fresh weight was measured and the five leaves per species 214 scanned. Leaves were dried at $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 48 h and dry weight was 215 measured. From these measurements, the following traits were 216 obtained for the 21 test species: plant height, leaf area (LA), 217 specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). 218 Plant height was determined as the average height of the five 219 plants sampled in the field (to the nearest mm). LA was 220 determined from the average of the five leaves, by measuring 221 the one-sided surface area of the scanned image of each 222 individual leaf using ImageJ software (version 1.47; NIH, USA) 223 (Appendix S1). SLA was calculated as one-sided leaf area divided 224 by its oven-dried weight, in $\mathrm{mm}^{2} / \mathrm{mg}$. LDMC is the measure of 225 dry leaf weight ( mg ) divided by fresh leaf weight ( g ).

226
We evaluated the relationships between plant species traits, 227 monoculture ecosystem properties, and ecosystem service 228 indicators using multiple linear regression in order to construct 229 a path diagram. We first evaluated the relationships between 230 ecosystem properties and service indicators (model results in 231 Table S1, Supporting Information) and then the relationships 232 between plant traits and ecosystem properties. As we 233 hypothesized that plant traits affect ecosystem services via 234 differences in ecosystem properties, we only examined the direct 235 effects of plant traits on ecosystem services if there were 236 no adequate models linking ecosystem properties directly to 237 services. Variables were transformed to improve homogeneity of 238 variance, and standardized ( $Z$-scores ${ }^{21}$ (Table S1). Model fit was 239 evaluated using the AICc criterion. ${ }^{22}$ All models were compared 240 using delta-weights, and when multiple models had delta- 241 weights lower than $7,{ }^{23}$ model averaging was used to generate 242 standardized regression coefficients (Table S1). The path 243 diagram was constructed using only those coefficients whose 244 $95 \%$ confidence limits did not overlap zero. Model selection and 245 averaging procedures used the MuMIn package in R. ${ }^{24}$

\section*{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}

247
Measured traits differed greatly among species with leaf 248 area spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude (Table 1). 249 Leaf area was highest in sod-forming graminoids but highly 250 variable within that group, relatively high in bunch-forming 251 graminoids, and lower but highly variable within the other 252 growth forms (Table 1). Height was consistently low in 253 creeping forbs and shrubs, relatively low but highly variable 254 within the succulents, and high but variable within a growth 255 form for the grasses and tall forbs. Leaf dry matter content 256 (LDMC) showed the least variation with an almost 7 -fold 257 difference between the lowest and highest species values 258 (Table 1). Low LDMC species included all the succulents and 259 Empetrum nigrum, Plantago maritima, and Sagina procumbens 260 (each from a different growth form group). Specific leaf 261 area (SLA) tended to be low for creeping shrubs, except for 262 E. nigrum. SLA for other growth forms varied greatly within a 263 group. S. procumbens, the only creeping forb included, had the 264 highest SLA (Table 1).

\end{figure}

Measured ecosystem properties also differed across growth forms and species. Growth rates were slightly negative for S. procumbens, Gaultheria procumbens, Sibbaldiopsis tridentata, Vaccinium macrocarpon, V. vitis-idaea, Rhodiola rosea, and Sedum spurium (Table 1). These are species that generally inhabit extremely shallow and low-nutrient soils ${ }^{26}$ and are expected to have low growth rates. These results also indicate that the canopies produced by these species reached their approximate maximum densities in the green roof system by the end of the first growing seasons. Tall forbs had consistently high canopy growth rates, as did both groups of grasses (Table 1). The succulent S. acre also had a relatively high growth rate. Creeping shrubs and forbs had low positive or negative canopy growth rates. The index of albedo showed the greatest range of variation within the succulent group with both the lowest and highest values ( $\sim 16 \%$ reflectivity for R. rosea and $\sim 26 \%$ for Sedum acre). Species in the other groups varied much less (between $16 \%$ and $19 \%$ reflectivity). Canopy density ranged from zero (for the extremely short ground cover V. vitis-idaea) to 243 contacts $/ 0.07 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ for the sod-forming graminoid Festuca rubra. Grasses tended to have consistently high canopy density, whereas tall forbs had consistently intermediate values (Table 1). While all creeping shrubs were at the low end of canopy densities, there was considerable variation among species in the group, as well as in the succulent group. Water loss rates ranged from $\sim 16 \%$ lower than unplanted controls (S. spurium), implying that the vegetation blocked evaporation from the bare substrate (relative to controls) but also had very low transpiration rates, to $22 \%$ higher (S.novi-belgii) than controls. Values substantially lower than controls were found in other species (Danthonia spicata, E. nigrum, and V. macrocarpon) that tended to concentrate their leaf biomass close to the substrate surface, likely presenting a barrier to evaporation from the substrate surface. There was otherwise little consistency in water loss within a growth form group. The effect of the planted species on snow depths ranged from $46 \%$ higher than unvegetated control modules in the dense-canopied F. rubra and other sod-forming graminoids, to close to no difference from controls for sparse-canopied tall forb Symphotrichum qnovi-belgii, and some creeping shrubs (Table 1).

Consistent with other green roof studies, ${ }^{27}$ vegetation had a relatively small effect on stormwater capture, with the greatest
increase relative to controls around $10 \%$ for $F$. rubra (Table 1). 308 Creeping shrubs tended to be at the high end for stormwater 309 capture, along with tall forbs, with succulents at the low end. 310 Several species had lower capture than controls (S. acre had one 311 of the lowest). Vegetation reduced summer substrate temper- 312 atures up to $26 \%$ lower than controls (Poa compressa and S. acre 313 had the coolest substrate). Some species were very similar in 314 substrate temperature to controls (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, 315 $V$. macrocarpon, V. vitis-idaea). In general, creeping shrubs 316 tended to cool the substrate the least, followed by tall forbs, 317 with inconsistent results among grass species and highly 318 variable performance among the succulents (Table 1). Organic 319 matter showed little difference from controls, with high 320 variability within a species and no consistent patterns between 321 growth forms, save that the three tall forb species tended to have 322 relatively high amounts of organic matter. Most species 323 contained equivalent phosphate in their substrate to controls; 324 the only species standing out with relatively low phosphate were 325 S. acre and Deschampsia flexuosa. Substrate nitrate varied greatly 326 among species with P. compressa showing very low levels ( $10 \%$ of 327 the control values), considerable range among the three grass 328 species, consistently low values among the three tall forbs, and 329 no clear pattern among the other species (Table 1). Most species 330 increased minimum winter substrate temperatures (registering as 331 lower values in Table 1) relative to controls. Two grasses with 332 relatively dense canopies close to the ground (D. spicata and 333 F. rubra) raised winter minimum temperatures by approximately 334 $30 \%$ relative to controls (Table 1). Grasses tended to have the 335 highest winter minimum temperatures, whereas tall forbs and 336 creeping shrubs had similar values to controls.

337
Most of the ecosystem service indicators were predicted by 338 vegetation properties (Figure 1). Stormwater capture was 339 positively correlated with plant height but not any of the 340 vegetation properties. The index of water loss rate was not 341 predicted by plant traits and did not predict any of the services. 342 The three services related to substrate chemistry (organic 343 matter, phosphate, and nitrate removal) were all positively 344 predicted by canopy growth rate, which was positively 345 predicted by plant height (Figure 1; Table S1). Substrate 346 cooling was positively related to albedo and canopy density. 347 Albedo was also related to canopy density but not any of the 348 plant traits. Canopy density was positively related to both SLA 349
and plant height. Substrate winter temperature increase was positively correlated with snow depth and canopy density. Deeper snow was associated with denser canopies, lower canopy growth rates, and higher albedo. Leaf area and LDMC were also positive predictors of snow depth.

Plant traits represent general characteristics of plant species, but their effects on ecosystem processes are mediated through canopy characteristics and the effects of plant canopies on microclimates. ${ }^{28-30}$ In this study, "ecosystem properties" represent empirically measured canopy variables from monoculture species populations grown in the green roof setting. Traits related to overall plant size and leaf characteristics measured under natural conditions predicted canopy density, canopy growth rate, and snow depth, which in turn predicted the ecosystem service indicators. The plant traits used as predictors here represent easy-to-measure "soft" ${ }^{20}$ traits that are correlated with process rates but not necessarily closely related mechanistically to ecological processes.

Plant height is a general indicator of high growth rates and/or evolution in resource-rich environments where competition for light is important, although there are many trade-offs involved in growing tall. ${ }^{31}$ The tallest species in this study were primarily graminoids and tall forbs (Table 1), which are associated with deeper soils and more fertile conditions, and had higher growth rates in the green roof system. It is important to note that "height" and the other leaf traits are general indicators of the fertility of the habitats where the species tend to grow naturally. While taller species performed some ecosystem services more effectively than shorter species in this system, there are important caveats relevant to interpreting these results. First, the species selected for these experiments all grow in relatively harsh or resourcelimited environments (Appendix S1) and tend to be relatively short compared with species from more fertile habitats. Our finding implies that the species that are tallest in a set of short species perform these services better than the shorter ones. Second, while the species we grew on the green roof generally grew shorter than under natural conditions, there may be disadvantages for relatively tall species in green roof environments. Relatively tall species may be more susceptible to drought, ${ }^{32}$ and tall species from relatively fertile environments may have higher resource requirements leading to population crashes if fertilization or supplemental irrigation are not applied. This study ran for a relatively short period of time so longer studies are required to determine how height and long-term survival may be related.

Stormwater capture was positively related to plant species height, possibly due to an overall greater resource demand and water uptake, possibly mediated through greater root biomass, which supports what has been found in other studies. ${ }^{33,34}$ In this study, species height also predicted canopy growth rate, and density, which were positive correlates of all the ecosystem service indicators except stormwater capture.

Canopy growth rate relates to the overall primary production of a population of a given species and is expected to be correlated with the organic matter content of soils, ${ }^{35}$ and rates of nutrient uptake. ${ }^{36}$ Here canopy growth rate was a relatively strong predictor of all three services related to soil properties: organic matter, phosphate, and nitrate contents. Species from relatively fertile environments (indicated by taller heights) grew faster in the green roof system and resulted in higher substrate organic matter, and lower phosphate and nitrate contents, likely as a result of overall higher rates of multiple metabolic processes.

Canopy density represents the density of live leaf and stem 413 parts in aboveground vegetation and was higher in the green 414 roof system for species that were generally taller in their natural 415 environments and had higher SLA values. These species, in 416 turn, gave rise to lower summer substrate temperatures and 417 higher winter minima. SLA represents the amount of invest- 418 ment in light-intercepting area per unit of dry mass and is 419 expected to be higher in species from more resource-rich 420 environments, resulting in a higher ability to harvest light per 421 unit biomass allocation. ${ }^{37}$ Again it is important to emphasize 422 that the high SLA species in this study are generally from the 423 most fertile areas in low productivity areas (coastal barrens, 424 rock outcrops) that have some similarities with the green roof 425 environment (shallow substrates, exposure to wind and sun). 426 SLA is positively correlated with net photosynthetic capacity, ${ }^{38}{ }_{427}$ potential growth rate, ${ }^{39}$ and evapotranspiration rate. ${ }^{40}$ High 428 SLA species in this study belong to a greater diversity of growth 429 forms than tall species: forbs, graminoids, shrubs, and 430 succulents were all among the highest SLA species.

431
High LDMC species included two dwarf shrubs in the same 432 genus (Vaccinium); low LDMC species were the succulents, 433 E. nigrum and Plantago maritima, which have relatively thick 434 leaves and likely high water storage similar to the true succulents. 435 Species with large individual leaf area included some graminoids 436 and tall forbs. Both leaf area and LDMC were weak positive 437 predictors of snow depth, although canopy density had the 438 strongest effect of any of the individual variables. This shows 439 that dense canopies led to greater trapping of windborne snow, 440 accumulation of less dense snow, and/or decreases in melt rate, 441 as predicted in previous work. ${ }^{18}$ When canopy density is held 442 constant there were also independent effects of leaf area and 443 LDMC so species with larger individual leaves and/or greater dry 444 matter content also resulted in deeper snow layers which have a 445 moderating effect on winter substrate temperatures (Figure 1). 446 While we did not measure canopy density in the winter (i.e., 447 we used August canopy densities to predict snow depths in the 448 following winter) the strong predictive power of summer canopy 449 density implies that species with dense canopies in summer 450 retain dense canopies of dead stems and leaves or woody tissue 451 in winter. Some of the high canopy density species tested in the 452 snow study were relatively slow growing; thus, there was a 453 negative relationship between growth rate and snow depth. 454 The relationships between snow accumulation and plant traits 455 are complex, as snow accumulation represents the outcome of 456 several distinct processes. ${ }^{41}$ Canopy density had an effect on 457 raising minimum winter substrate temperatures independent of 458 snow depth, suggesting that plant residues, leaves from evergreen 459 species, or other structures helped retain heat in the substrate. 460 One possible mechanism is the reduction of convective heat 461 losses due to reduction of air movement within the canopy ${ }^{42}$ and 462 lower wind speeds at ground level ${ }^{43}$ even when canopy material 463 is largely dead.

464
Here we used an ecological approach to predict green roof 465 services: plant traits measured on plants growing in their natural 466 habitats were linked to ecosystem services via statistical models, 467 using empirical data from replicated green roof modules. The 468 approach taken by environmental engineers usually involves 469 using numerical models of physical processes to predict key 470 variables, and altering parameter values to explore sensitivity 471 to environmental variability due to climate or vegetation type. ${ }^{4} 472$ The finding that substrate cooling has a positive relationship with 473 both albedo and canopy density is congruent with the findings 474 from numerical heat balance models, although our temperature 475
index includes several sources of variation from averaging across replicates within a species and sampling dates. Parametric variations in simulation studies have found leaf area index (LAI, representing single-sided total leaf area in the canopy) to be one of the most important parameters in determining the reduction of substrate surface temperatures, with LAI inversely related to substrate surface temperature. ${ }^{44-46}$ This result is due to LAI being a factor in the calculation of convective heat transfer, evapotranspiration, and shading. These heat fluxes are generally calculated according to the "big leaf" approach, i.e., the PenmanMonteith equation for evapotranspiration, whereby the heat fluxes of a single, average leaf are extrapolated to the canopy level via the LAI. While we did not measure LAI directly, within a species, LAI and canopy density should be linearly and positively related. Further empirical work to quantify LAI for different green roof vegetation types is the next step to link screening of species using ecological traits with prediction of green roof functioning.

Sensitivity analyses suggest that plant height is one of the primary variables determining thermal gain through green roofs. ${ }^{47}$ In this study, average plant height for a given species in its natural habitats is correlated with substrate cooling via its role in canopy density (Figure 1), possibly via greater reflection and/or absorption of solar radiation, represented in numerical models by the extinction coefficient. Plants that were relatively tall in natural habitats produced a lot of canopy density on the green roof, due to high productivity and a generally taller stature than the other species. However, the role of plant height in reducing ground heat flux is also likely due to its role in the aerodynamic resistance of convective and latent heat transfer. According to the logarithmic wind profile approach adopted in numerous green roof heat balance models, ${ }^{4,48,49}$ vertical wind shear within the canopy increases the convective and evapotranspiration heat losses from the green roof system for taller plants by reducing the aerodynamic resistance and thus reducing the heat flux into the substrate. Thus, taller plants likely influence substrate temperatures via several mechanisms simultaneously.
Additional cooling mechanisms reduce the importance of albedo in the surface energy balance of a green roof compared to a conventional roof; ${ }^{50}$ however, the results of this study showed canopy albedo still had a positive relationship with substrate cooling. To simulate the effects of albedo on heating loads, one study compared Sedum tomentosum in monoculture to a mixture of Sedum species, ${ }^{51}$ which had measured canopy reflection coefficients of 0.23 and 0.11 , respectively, using a previously validated green roof model. ${ }^{52}$ The average peak net radiation difference and average net radiation between the two plant conditions was as high as $\sim 16 \%$ and $\sim 20 \%$, respectively, suggesting that plant screening for canopy albedo may result in improvements to green roof thermal performance. None of the plant traits we used predicted albedo, so additional traits related to leaf optical properties would need to be incorporated to allow this kind of screening.

Several empirical studies show that stormwater retention in green roofs is related to antecedent soil moisture content; ${ }^{5,27,53}$ thus, high transpiration rates in the vegetation should be able to increase the water holding capacity of soil. While some green roof studies show a relationship between water loss rate and stormwater capture, ${ }^{16}$ the current study did not show this. The index of water loss used here represented water lost within the first 48 h of water addition, when conditions were wet and water loss would be a function of both evaporation from
substrate surface and transpiration from the canopy, as well as 539 possible drainage after the first 10 min of runoff. A longer 540 drying period, leading to a drier substrate surface, might have 541 produced a clearer signal of differential transpiration rates 542 among species and a stronger effect on subsequent stormwater 543 retention, as evaporation from the substrate surface would 544 have been minimized after it dried out completely. Stormwater 545 capture should be a function of water loss over the entire interval 546 between rain events; thus, the experimental method employed 547 here likely overlooked the differences among plant species in ET 548 rates over the longer term.

Since leachate from green roofs can be high in nutrients, ${ }^{53,54}{ }_{550}$ the uptake and retention of nutrients by vegetation could 551 mitigate nutrient pollution in runoff. Here we measured 552 substrate concentrations of nitrate and phosphate after four 553 years of plant growth; the index of removal was relative to 554 control modules in which leaching was presumed to be the 555 primary process driving nutrient loss. The low nutrient content 556 relative to controls in some plant species treatments (Table 1) 557 suggests that plant uptake and cycling within the plant- 558 substrate system is responsible for the reductions, rather than 559 greatly increased leaching rates for vegetated modules. We did 560 not quantify leachate concentrations directly, and it is clear 561 that further work needs to be done to examine the effects of 562 plant species on nutrient dynamics and water quality in green 563 roof systems. Likewise, our measurement of organic matter 564 is intended to be an index of the differential ability of plant 565 species to contribute toward carbon capture in the system, 566 although it omits key variables such as inorganic carbon that are 567 essential to understand the entire impact of green roof vege- 568 tation on carbon sequestration. ${ }^{7}$ These indices only partially 569 capture the important ecosystem services of green roofs, but 570 they clearly respond to differences in plant species, suggesting 571 that plant traits can be used to optimize ecosystem service 572 provisioning.

573
While shallow-substrate (extensive) green roofs are usually 574 planted with succulents due to their superior drought tolerance, 575 the plants with the highest trait values tended not to be 576 succulents in this study. The most common vegetation for 577 shallow-substrate green roofs is mixtures of Sedum species or 578 other succulents. ${ }^{9}$ While here we only quantified the effects of 579 plant traits on monoculture provisioning of ecosystem services, 580 a past study on the same system showed that a Sedum mixture 581 and S. acre monocultures performed similarly for summer sub- 582 strate temperature reductions, albedo, and stormwater capture 583 (other services were not quantified). ${ }^{16}$ This suggests that Sedum 584 mixtures should be effective at summer cooling but relatively 585 poor in stormwater capture, relative to other species we 586 examined. As several other studies have shown, ${ }^{16,33,35,55,56} 587$ succulents are not always the best choice if particular ecosystem 588 services are to optimized besides roof cooling, but less drought 589 tolerant species sharing the traits identified here could be 590 included on green roofs depending on regional climate, 591 availability of irrigation, and other factors.

592
In addition to Sedum mixtures, shallow-substrate green roofs 593 often employ more diverse species and growth form mixtures. ${ }^{8} 594$ Some designs feature multiple species planted as monocultural 595 beds, and our results are relevant to single-species patches within 596 diverse roofs of this kind. However, predicting ecosystem 597 services from species-diverse roofs featuring multispecies 598 communities requires a different approach. Future studies should 599 examine functional trait diversity in species mixtures to 600 determine the effects on ecosystem services. The approach we 601

adopted allows prediction of monoculture performance as a first
step toward screening lists of species for possible inclusion in mixed plantings.

This study also shows that broad growth form groupings can exhibit considerable variation in traits among species, suggesting that functional traits, rather than growth form groups might be used for green roof plant selection. Height and SLA were the best predictors, and while height was consistent for only some of the growth form groups, SLA was highly variable both within and between groups. Out of the species tested here, we could recommend designing green roofs with species that have relatively high SLA and height values, such as F. rubra. It is also possible that mixtures of species with opposite trait values (e.g., a short species with high SLA such as S. procumbens and a tall species such as Carex nigra with low SLA) might be combined to yield optimal functioning, if the diversity in morphology leads to complementary resource use or other synergistic effects. ${ }^{16}$ However, the design criteria for a particular roof, including ecosystem services to be maximized, may require attention to other traits not measured here such as flowering period or other variables related to habitat use by animals or human aesthetic criteria.

This study used plant leaf and traits determined by an average of measurements from plants from five naturally occurring populations. The ecosystem properties and service indicators measured on the green roof also represent averages within each species. Despite the considerable variation in traits and response variables within a species (Table 1), there was still a high predictive ability across species. The novelty of this study is to show that simple leaf and canopy traits can predict multiple important green roof functions. While the indices we used cannot be directly converted into precise estimates of ecosystem services for use in cost benefit analyses or use in numerical modeling, traits can be used to screen large numbers of species. Plant traits for many regional floras are now available in databases ${ }^{57}$ and can be used to generate plant lists for further empirical testing and for the design of many kinds of constructed ecosystems.

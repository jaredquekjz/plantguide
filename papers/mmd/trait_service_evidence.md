## Notes
- Trait abbreviations: **SLA** = specific leaf area; **LDMC** = leaf dry matter content; **SRL** = specific root length; **LMA** is the inverse of SLA.
- Many relationships are context dependent (ecosystem type, seasonality, management). Where the review distinguishes ecosystems, this is indicated in the findings above.

## Additional Evidence (Miedema Brown & Anand 2022)
- Scope: Review of 19 ES (16 with trait indicators). Highlights potential “universal” indicators across services and habitat/season dependence of many links.
- Cross-service indicators: **SLA**, **LDMC**, **leaf nitrogen** recur as quantitative indicators across multiple services; suitable as economical proxy measures when detailed trait suites are infeasible.
- Context dependence: Trait–service relationships can flip or vary by habitat type and season; emphasizes selecting indicators specific to ecosystem and subservice (e.g., floods vs. fire under disturbance prevention).

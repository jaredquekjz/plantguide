\begin{abstract}
Emerging fungal infectious diseases constitute the largest pathogen threat to plants. However, the factors influencing fungal-plant interactions, host shifts, and the emergence of pathogens on a novel host are still not well understood. Evolutionary relationships among hosts appear to be important, with closely related hosts often sharing pathogens and pests, but we typically lack information on the evolutionary history of the pathogens. Here, we gather over 27,000 sequences to construct a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for Botryosphaeriaceae, a fungal family including many emerging pathogens of global concern, and explore the evolutionary conservatism in fungal-plant associations across host and pathogen phylogenies. We reveal a significant influence of both phylogenies in constraining fungal-plant associations. However, we also show that most fungal pathogens are generalists, able to infect multiple hosts, and demonstrate an evolutionary trend toward increased generalism, contrary to theory that suggests that pathogens should evolve toward increased host specialization. We suggest that the anthropogenic movement of plant species and agricultural practices might have allowed some Botryosphaeriaceae to escape phylogenetic constraints on host range via increasing the ecological opportunities for host shifts. Understanding the factors influencing fungal-plant interaction and host breadth of pathogenic fungi could help identify emerging threats, prevent spillover onto naïve plants, and reduce the risk of further host range expansion.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Plant diseases are complex and caused by a diverse array of pathogen types, including fungi, viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, nematodes, phytoplasmas, and other parasitic plants (Strange \& Scott, 2005). Among them, fungal pathogens are the most common causes of emerging plant diseases
(Anderson et al., 2004) and infection can have catastrophic consequences for their hosts and people (Anagnostakis, 1987; Bruns, 2017; McCook \& Vandermeer, 2015).

Increased rates of pathogen emergence (Bebber et al., 2014) require explanation, leading to a growing body of research on factors influencing host shifts and host range expansions. While the full suite of factors that

delimit plant-pathogen associations is not well known, host evolutionary history and pathogen host breadth have been shown to be important in predicting interactions and the risk of pathogen emergence (Morris \& Moury, 2019; Woolhouse \& Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). The phylogenetic signal of pathogen-host associations is two-sided (Gougherty \& Davies, 2021). On the one side, pathogens tend to infect plants that are closely related (Gilbert \& Webb, 2007), a conserved trend observed across most pathogens and pests (Gilbert et al., 2012). On the other side, closely related pathogens tend to infect similar plant hosts (Morris \& Moury, 2019), whether these hosts are themselves closely related or not. Both observations can be explained by phylogenetic conservation, either in host traits involved in plant defense (Gilbert \& Parker, 2016; Morris \& Moury, 2019) or in the pathogen traits to overcome those defenses (Gougherty \& Davies, 2021). However, analyses considering both host and pathogen phylogenies are rare. While the plant tree of life is now increasingly well resolved (Carta et al., 2021; Gastauer \& Meira-Neto, 2016; Janssens et al., 2020; Smith \& Brown, 2018), information on plant pathogen phylogenies is currently less available (see some notable exceptions in Gougherty \& Davies, 2021; Yang, Tyler, \& Hong, 2017), limiting our ability to investigate co-phylogenetic patterns of pathogen-host associations. Here, we explore those interactions in the Botryosphaeriaceae (Ascomycota, Dothideomycetes, Botryosphaeriales), a fungal family including several emerging pathogens.

Historically, the fluid taxonomy of many fungal groups has posed a particular challenge to resolving their evolutionary relationships (Zhou \& May, 2023). For example, over a century of work has been dedicated to the taxonomy of the Botryosphaeriaceae and the correct assignment of species to genera within the family since it was first described in 1918 (Phillips et al., 2013; Slippers \& Wingfield, 2007; Theissen \& Sydow, 1918; von Arx \& Muller, 1954). This fungal family is composed of diverse fungi, with some species considered among the most aggressive pathogens in endophyte communities (Slippers \& Wingfield, 2007). Pathogenic taxa within Botryosphaeriaceae cause diseases in a wide array of economically important plant hosts, including Acacia spp. (Jami et al., 2014; Marsberg et al., 2017; Urbez-Torres et al., 2016), almond (Prunus dulcis; Olmo et al., 2016), Eucalyptus spp. (Ahumada, 2003; Smith et al., 1994), olives (Olea europaea; Urbez-Torres et al., 2013), Pinus spp. (Burgess et al., 2004), walnut (Juglans regia; Chen et al., 2014), and grapevines (Vitis vinifera; Urbez-Torres, 2011), among many others. Plants hosting Botryosphaeriaceae have been recorded in almost all geographical areas of the world (Slippers \& Wingfield, 2007), with some fungal taxa having a wide host breadth, which we refer to as generalists, while others have only been recorded on one or a few plant hosts, referred to as specialists (Silva-Valderrama, Úrbez-Torres, \& Davies, 2024). Yet
relatively little is known about the factors determining the host breadth of species within the family or the likelihood of pathogen emergence on a novel host.

Pathogens with wide host breadth are considered to pose the greatest risk to spillover and emergence on a new host (Woolhouse \& Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Within the Botryosphaeriaceae, fungal pathogens with wide host range have also been reported as some of the most damaging species in the family (Slippers \& Wingfield, 2007), suggesting that host jumps by these taxa may have severe consequences for novel hosts, including several economically important crops. However, a trajectory toward decreasing host breadth and increasing host specialization has traditionally been considered the dominant evolutionary process (Nylin et al., 2018). Host generalism has thus been interpreted as a transient state with strong selection for reversals back to specialization, selecting for higher efficiency in nutrient acquisition and circumvention of plant defenses (Janz \& Nylin, 2008). Observations of broad fungal generalists might be evidence for alternative dynamics describing a process of host range expansion and diversification (Sriswasdi et al., 2017), which could lead to cycles between broad and narrow host ranges (cf. the oscillation hypothesis of Janz \& Nylin, 2008). In the Botryosphaeriaceae, some taxa, including Neofusicoccum parvum and Macrophomina phaseolina, have unusually wide host ranges, suggesting either rapid evolution and relaxation of constraints on host breadth or that recent global changes may have provided new opportunities for host range expansion for these species.

Here, we explore the diversity in host breadth among species within the Botryosphaeriaceae fungal family. We ask (1) whether pathogen evolutionary history is important in defining fungal-plant associations, (2) if increasing host specialism is the dominant evolutionary trajectory in the Botryosphaeriaceae, and (3) which factors drive the emergence of super generalists? We first construct a comprehensive phylogenetic tree of the family and investigate phylogenetic constraints on fungal-plant association, considering the evolutionary history of both pathogens and hosts. We then examine the evolutionary trends toward host specialism versus generalism, finding an abundance of generalists in the family and evidence for a greater rate of transition from specialism to generalism compared to the reverse pathway. Finally, we review the likely role of human movement of plant species in determining the present-day distribution of Botryosphaeriaceae fungi across hosts.

\section*{METHODS}

\section*{Data collection}

To reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of Botryosphaeriaceae, we first merged sequence data from GenBank with the
dataset from Batista et al. (2021) and supplemented these data through sequencing of additional isolates, as detailed below.

We downloaded sequences for the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2, including the intervening 5.8S nrDNA gene (ITS), and parts of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef), beta-tubulin (tub2), large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU) and the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) genes using the R package ape (Paradis \& Schliep, 2019). Isolates without three or more sequenced genes from this set were excluded from our matrix.

\section*{Isolate sequencing}

To ensure good taxonomic and geographical coverage, additional sequence data were obtained directly by sequencing isolates sourced from Algeria, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Panama, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and the United States (Appendix S1: Table S1). Mycelium plugs were received in sterile water and immediately plated in potato dextrose agar (PDA, $39 \mathrm{gr} / \mathrm{L}$, HIMEDIA supplemented with $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ of agar) and incubated at $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the dark until we observed actively growing mycelium (5-7 days).

We collected aerial mycelium from 7-day-old cultures. DNA was extracted using a Soil DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germany) with minimal modifications to the manufacturer's protocol. We used $4-\mathrm{mm}$ ceramic beads and 0.2 mL of glass sand to disrupt the fungal cell wall. DNA quality was assessed in 1\% agar gel with ethidium bromide (EtBr). We performed PCR to amplify the ITS region (ITS1 and ITS4 primers; White et al., 1990), tef (EF1-728F and EF1-986R primers; Glass \& Donaldson, 1995) and tub2 genes (Bt2a and Bt2b primers; Carbone \& Kohn, 1999). PCR reactions were each prepared in a final volume of $20 \mu \mathrm{~L}$, with $1 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of genomic DNA ( $25 \mathrm{ng}_{\mu} \mathrm{L}^{-1}$ ), $2.5 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of Taq Buffer 10X, $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of dNTP mix ( 10 mM ), $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of forward primer ( 10 mM ), $0.5 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of reverse primer $\mathrm{R}(10 \mathrm{mM})$, $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of Taq DNA polymerase ( 5 units $\mu \mathrm{L}^{-1}$; Thermo Fisher), and $19.8 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of ultrapure water to complete the volume and conducted on a MiniAmp Plus Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher). PCR programs were as previously described for each gene (Carbone \& Kohn, 1999; Glass \& Donaldson, 1995; White et al., 1990). The quality of amplification was assessed using a $1.5 \%$ agar gel with EtBr. PCR products were cleaned using the QIAquick kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA ). Amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) protocol in an ABI3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher) Sanger sequencing machine.

Sequences were submitted to GenBank (Appendix S1: Table S1).

\section*{Phylogenetic tree construction}

We generated multiple sequence alignments of the five individual loci (ITS, tef, tub2, LSU, and rpb2) using MAFFT v7.450 (Katoh \& Standley, 2013). Duplicated sequences were removed using Geneious Prime v2024.0.5 (https://www.geneious.com). Phylogenetic uninformative positions were trimmed based on similarity statistics with TrimAl v.1.2.59 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) using the command "-automated1" in CIPRES (Miller et al., 2010). Alignments were concatenated into a supermatrix using Geneious Prime v2024.0.5, and duplicated sequence alignments were removed. Maximum likelihood analyses (ML) were performed with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 (Minh et al., 2020), using models selected by ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017), under BIC-selection, for each partitioned gene (Chernomor et al., 2016; Appendix S1: Table S2). To estimate branch support, we used ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot; Thi Hoang et al., 2017), approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT; Guindon et al., 2010), and approximate Bayes test (aBayes; Anisimova et al., 2011) with 5000 iterations and 10,000 bootstraps (Appendix S1: Figure S1). Saccharata proteae (Botryosphaeriales, Dothideomycetes), Venturia pyrina (Venturiaceae, Dothideomycetes), Trichoderma harzianum (Hypocreaceae, Sordariomycetes), Botrytis cinerea (Sclerotiniaceae, Leotiomycetes), Amanita muscaria (Amanitaceae, Agaricomycetes), and Saprolegnia parasitica (Saprolegniaceae, Oomycota) were used as outgroups for the phylogenetic inference (Appendix S1: Table S3), but were subsequently pruned from the tree with the exception of $S$. proteae, which was retained to root the topology.

Trees for individual genera, Botryosphaeria, Diplodia, Dothiorella, Lasiodiplodia, and Neofusicoccum, were reconstructed using the same methodology described above (Appendix S1: Figures S2-S6). Trees were manually assessed for clade conflicts between isolates belonging to the same species using the R package ggtree (Yu et al., 2017), collapsing isolates to single representative species using the package ape (Paradis \& Schliep, 2019), phytools (Revell, 2024), and treeio (Wang et al., 2020).

The Botryosphaeriaceae phylogenetic reconstruction was made ultrametric using penalized likelihood in the R packages chronos (Vrahatis et al., 2016) and ape (Paradis \& Schliep, 2019) following the approach described by Sanderson (2002), determining the appropriate lambda by cross-validation (CV). Branch lengths were
dated using the divergence times proposed by Rathnayaka et al. (2023).

\section*{Plant host data collection}

Host data were extracted from Silva-Valderrama (2023), which aggregated data from agricultural reports and scientific papers (Batista et al., 2021; Jami et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020; Yang, Groenewald, et al., 2017; Zhang, Groenewald, et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhou, et al., 2021), sequence repositories (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI], 2024), and public databases, including United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Fungal Database (Farr et al., 2021) and FungalTraits (Põlme et al., 2020). The plant host phylogeny was derived from the recently published plant mega-phylogenies using the V.PhyloMaker2 R package (Jin \& Qian, 2022) and the Smith and Brown molecular backbone phylogeny (Smith \& Brown, 2018).

Phylogenetic diversity (PDiv) of the hosts, defined as the sum of the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree that span the members of the set, here representing the list of host taxa associated with a given Botryosphaeriaceae species, was calculated according to Faith (1992) on the plant host phylogeny.

\section*{Phylogenetic comparative analyses}

\section*{Phylogenetic signal and clustering of fungal-plant associations}

In a coevolutionary arms race between plants and pathogens, plants evolve new defense strategies against pathogens, and pathogens evolve new ways to overcome those defenses (Barrett et al., 2009). We suggest that this tight coevolutionary process might select for phylogenetic constraints in the range of hosts a particular pathogen can infect (clustering of hosts on the plant phylogeny) and in the suite of pathogens able to infect a given host (clustering of pathogens on the fungal phylogeny). We quantified the relative strength of these two phylogenetic constraints using the standard effect size (SES) of the mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) between plant hosts, for the former, and fungal pathogens for the latter, using the package picante in R (Kembel et al., 2010). Negative ses.MPD values ( $z$ score $<0$ ) indicate phylogenetic clustering relative to null expectations of random host-pathogen associations, while a positive ses.MPD ( $z$ score $>0$ ) would reflect greater evenness than expected from the null (Ssebuliba \& Davies, 2021).

Co-phylogenetic analyses of host-pathogen associations

Exploration of both sides of the pathogen-host phylogenetic conservatism simultaneously can provide deeper insight into their associations (Gougherty \& Davies, 2021; Morris \& Moury, 2019). Here, we used the Botryosphaeriaceae-host association data from Silva-Valderrama (2023) and both host and pathogen phylogenies to perform two separate co-phylogenetic analyses. First, we estimated the modularity of the pathogen-host association network, using the approach described by Krasnov et al. (2012), to examine the phylogenetic closeness of pathogens and hosts belonging to the same module. Second, using the ParaFitGlobal method of Legendre et al. (2002), we evaluated the evidence for pathogen-host codivergence.

We calculated the modularity of the pathogen-host association network following Krasnov et al. (2012) using code from Pfenning-Butterworth, Davies, and Cressler (2021) and the R package igraph (Csardi \& Nepusz, 2006). Modules were identified using the cluster_walktrap function in igraph, and we evaluated whether plants and fungi in the same module tended to be more closely related than expected by comparing the pairwise phylogenetic distance between species (plant hosts or Botryosphaeriaceae) within and between modules. In a pathogen-host network with high modularity, we would find clusters of fungal-plant associations that mainly interact with one another, but not with other clusters of plants and fungal species (Pfenning-Butterworth, Davies, \& Cressler, 2021). We compared observations to a null generated by randomly permuting the pathogen-host association matrix using a set of three methods of bootstrap permutations (Hadfield et al., 2014; Pfenning-Butterworth, Davies, \& Cressler, 2021). The first (L1), as proposed by Legendre et al. (2002), maintains host richness per pathogen, but the identity of those hosts is randomized. The second (L2), also proposed by Legendre et al. (2002), maintains the same number of pathogens per host, but the pathogen identity is randomized. In the third method (H), proposed by Hommola et al. (2009), the total number of pathogen-host associations is preserved, but those associations are randomly determined. Under all three permutation methods, a null distribution is computed with 1000 bootstraps, to which observed values are compared.

The ParaFitGlobal test assesses the position of pathogens and hosts in their respective trees, where perfect congruence between phylogenies is interpreted as consistent with a model of co-diversification. The null hypothesis here is that pathogens and hosts evolved independently and that associations are randomly formed. As detailed
in Pfenning-Butterworth, Davies, and Cressler (2021), ParaFitGlobal calculates the "fourth corner" statistic based on the products of three matrices detailing the host phylogeny, the pathogen phylogeny, and their association (Legendre et al., 2002), which are then contrasted with null expectations using the three methods of permutations described above.

\section*{Phylogenetic analysis of host breadth}

To explore determinants of fungal host breadth, we next evaluated whether closely related Botryosphaeriaceae had similar host breadth by quantifying the phylogenetic signal in host number using Bloomberg's $K$ (Blomberg et al., 2003) in the R package picante (Kembel et al., 2010). Phylogenetic structure in the number of hosts associated with each fungal taxon could indicate that heritable pathogen traits determine host breadth, representing evolutionary processes over longer periods of time.

\section*{Evolutionary transitions between generalism and specialism}

To investigate the relative frequency of host generalism versus host specialism in the Botryosphaeriaceae, we perform two independent analyses. First, we suggest that if evolution toward increasing specialism was the dominant process (see, e.g., Nylin et al., 2018), species with a broad host range would tend to be younger than species with a narrow host range as generalists would shift toward specialism over evolutionary time. We, therefore, tested whether specialists were younger than generalists, using pendant edge lengths as a proxy for taxon age and classifying specialism/generalism along a continuous scale of host breadth (number of recorded host species). We explored the correlation between species age and host breadth using phylogenetic generalized linear models (pgls) fitted with the R package caper (Orme et al., 2023) to account for phylogenetic nonindependence.

Second, to evaluate the evolutionary trajectories from generalism to specialism and the reverse, we estimated transition rates between specialism and generalism under a model of discrete character evolution with the R package geiger (Pennell et al., 2014). In our initial model, we define specialists as those species able to infect up to two plant hosts, and generalists as species with three or more hosts. We then evaluated transition rates between intermediate classifications of generalism (clustering fungi with $1-2,3-4,5-6,7-8,9-10,11-15,16-20,21-59$, 51-100, and $100+$ plant hosts), exploring finer scale evolutionary steps between generalism and specialism.

It is possible that specialist fungal pathogens that rely on one or a few hosts might be more at risk of extinction because they have few alternative hosts if their primary host becomes rare or extinct. If this were the case, we might underestimate transitions to specialism; we therefore fit an additional model-Binary-State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE)-in the diversitree R package (Fitzjohn, 2012) to simultaneously estimate extinction and speciation rates alongside state transition rates. We then compared the fit of the model allowing diversification rates to differ between generalists and specialists to a model in which both states (generalism and specialism) were constrained to have identical extinction rates.

\section*{Anthropogenic movement of species and fungal host breadth}

Economically important crops have been moved around the globe multiple times, which, we suggest, could influence fungal host breadth in various ways. For example, transported crops could have carried fungi to new areas, providing them with the opportunity to expand their distribution and colonize new hosts in their introduced range. It is also possible that native fungal pathogens could have colonized introduced plants, including them as new hosts (see scenarios in Burgess \& Wingfield, 2017). We examine how host breadth relates to the anthropogenic movement of plants, using the data on Botryosphaeriaceae-plant associations from Silva-Valderrama (2023) and data on human uses of host plants obtained from the World Economic Plants-WEP database (US National Plant Germplasm System, 2024) using the categories "Human Food," "Fuels," "Animal Food," and "Materials." First, we fit separate pgls with host breadth as the response and host association with one or more of V. vinifera, Mangifera indica, and Eucalyptus spp., coded as a binary variable, as the predictor, using the R package caper (Orme et al., 2023). These host taxa provide examples of economically important crops that have been extensively dispersed around the globe by people. Second, we use the data of the WEP database to identify Botryosphaeriaceae with host plants used by people. We then compare the number of hosts of these Botryosphaeriaceae species with the host breadth of species with no hosts in the WEP database.

To address the bias that fungal species with a broad host range are also more likely to include an economically important crop host by chance, for each fungal pathogen, we quantified whether WEP hosts were overor underrepresented compared to a null of drawing hosts at random. We calculated the proportion of WEP hosts relative to the total number of hosts associated with each fungus. We then performed 1000 iterations of
random sampling of hosts (matching to the observed number of hosts for each fungus) from the total pool of plants associated with Botryosphaeriaceae and calculated the proportion of WEP hosts in each random draw. Last, we derived an SES for each fungus to quantify whether fungi associated with a high number of hosts tended to be associated with economically important crops more often than expected by chance.

All datasets and code to fully replicate this study are available at the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) under identifier urn:uuid:b47027d5-c68f-4244--bc82-b7f065133771. The code includes sections with background and explanations for all the analyses presented.

\section*{RESULTS}

We reconstructed the Botryosphaeriaceae phylogeny (Figure 1 and Appendix S1: Figure S1) using maximum likelihood on a matrix of 27,617 sequences for ITS, tub2, tef, LSU, and/or rpb2, summarized at the species level. While we believe our reconstruction is the most comprehensive yet produced for Botryosphaeriaceae, to maximize resolution, we excluded isolates with fewer than three genes sequenced, and our tree therefore omits some species from the family (including the monotypic genus Botryobambusa (Dissanayake et al., 2021) and the duotypic Mucoharknessia). Nonetheless, our reconstruction includes 193 species ( $\sim 80 \%$ of the total number of species currently recognized within the family; Batista et al., 2021 v 3.0 ) and 19 of the 21 recognized genera (Yang, Groenewald, et al., 2017; Zhang, Groenewald, et al., 2021), following recent taxonomic revisions where possible (see, e.g., Yang, Groenewald, et al., 2017; Zhang, Groenewald, et al., 2021). Genera with the highest number of species include Botryosphaeria (12), Diplodia (25), Dothiorella (34), Lasiodiplodia (43), and Neofusicoccum (43) (Appendix S1: Figures S2-S6).

\section*{Evolutionary relatedness strongly informs Botryosphaeriaceae-plant host associations}

Variation in host breadth may be explained by phylogenetic constraints of hosts, the fungi, or both. The importance of pathogen and host evolutionary histories in structuring host-pathogen associations is revealed by the mapping of the phylogeny of plant hosts onto the phylogeny of Botryosphaeriaceae fungi (Figure 2a). Host plants were, on average, associated with $4.458 \pm 4.867$ fungal taxa (mean $\pm \mathrm{SD} ; \mathrm{SE}=0.20$ ), with V. vinifera (grapes; 56 Botryosphaeriaceae species), Eucalyptus spp. (43), M. indica (mangos; 32), and Citrus spp. (28) having the
highest diversity of recorded Botryosphaeriaceae associations (Figure 2a,c, bottom). Fungal species with the highest reported host range were M. phaseolina (604 host species), Lasiodiplodia theobromae (548), Botryosphaeria dothidea (529), N. parvum (295), and Diplodia seriata (130) (Figure 2a,c, top), considered hyper-generalists, capable of infecting hundreds of hosts. The average host use by Botryosphaeriaceae was $28.669 \pm 86.670$ plant species (mean $\pm \mathrm{SD} ; \mathrm{SE}=7.432$ ), suggesting a predominance of generalists over specialists.

We first examined the evidence for phylogenetic structure in Botryosphaeriaceae-host plant associations using the SES of the mean phylogenetic pairwise distance (ses.MPD) between Botryosphaeriaceae species summarized across each plant host, and between plant hosts summarized across each fungal species (Figure 2b). We found phylogenetic clustering ( $z$ score $<0$ ) both among hosts and fungi (one-sample $t$ test to evaluate statistical deviation from zero, $t=-7.088$, $\mathrm{df}=597$, and $t=$ -6.222 , df $=132$, for host and fungi, respectively, both $p<0.001$ ), supporting phylogenetic conservatism in host use among fungal pathogens and fungal susceptibility among plant hosts: Botryosphaeriaceae fungi tend to infect plant hosts more closely related than expected by chance, and plants tend to be infected by more closely related Botryosphaeriaceae than expected by chance. The strength of clustering measured on the host phylogeny was significantly different from the strength of clustering measured on the fungal phylogeny (mean $z$ score $=$ -0.865 vs. -0.488 , measured on the host and fungal phylogeny, respectively, Welch two-sample $t$ test $t=-2.432$, $\mathrm{df}=201.92, p<0.05$ ), with a trend for tighter phylogenetic clustering of the hosts associated with individual Botryosphaeriaceae than observed among the fungal species able to colonize each plant host. However, we observe variation in both the strength and sign of clustering among hyper-generalists (Figure 2d). For example, $M$. phaseolina has a $z$ score of 1.181, indicating that its hosts tend to be more evenly dispersed across the host phylogeny, whereas B. dothidea has a $z$ score of -0.707 , indicating that its hosts are more clustered on the host phylogeny.

Second, we evaluated phylogenetic patterns across both phylogenies simultaneously to further explore the relative contribution of the host versus pathogen phylogeny in structuring species associations. Using the approach of Krasnov et al. (2012) that identifies "modules" of host-pathogen interactions, we found a significant correlation between co-association with a module and the mean of the pairwise phylogenetic distances (MPD) of hosts and fungi within the module (Table 1, $p<0.05$ for all methods of permutation), supporting the findings above and suggesting strong phylogenetic

clustering of Botryosphaeriaceae and plant hosts. We then used the ParaFitGlobal method to explore evidence for co-diversification, assuming a null hypothesis of
independent evolution. We revealed significant phylogenetic congruence in host-pathogen associations, irrespective of the choice of the null (Table 1, $p<0.05$ for
all methods of permutation), which has been considered to be consistent with a model of codivergence.

\section*{Specialism versus generalism}

Visual assessment of fungal host breadth relative to their phylogenetic relationship did not suggest any obvious structure. Generalist Botryosphaeriaceae do not appear to be clustered in one clade but are rather dispersed across the fungal phylogeny. We quantified the phylogenetic signal in the number of reported plant hosts across the Botryosphaeriaceae phylogeny using Blomberg's $K$ (Blomberg et al., 2003). Matching to observations, we found no statistically significant signal ( $K=0.22, p>0.05$ ).

While we most commonly define generalist and specialist fungi by their number of reported hosts, as above, some fungi might be associated with a high total number of hosts but span only a narrow breadth of the host phylogeny if hosts are closely related, and other fungi might infect only a few hosts, but those hosts might be distantly related. We, therefore, evaluated the relationship between host richness and host PDiv (Figure 2c, top) and repeat this for fungal richness on plant hosts with PDiv measured on the fungal phylogeny (Figure 2c, bottom). We show that taxon richness strongly correlates with PDiv, and thus, hosts or fungi with a greater number of associations span a greater breadth of the fungal and plant phylogeny, respectively. However, we note that hyper-generalist fungi such as B. dothidea, L. theobromae, M. phaseolina, and N. parvum tend to be outliers, infecting plants that are more or less closely related than the overall trend (Figure 2c, top).

\section*{Specialists tend to transition toward generalism}

If generalism were a transitionary state, we might expect a greater frequency of generalism among younger fungal taxa. However, we found no significant correlation between host breadth and taxon age ( $t$ value $=-1.017$, $F$-statistic $=1.034$ on 1 and $194 \mathrm{df}, p>0.05$ from pgls). Moreover, we observed an overall greater number of generalists ( 134 species) than specialists ( 62 species) (Figure 3a). Here, we defined generalists as fungi with $>2$ hosts, but we would have to relax the definition of specialism to encompass taxa with up to 4 hosts before we would return a different ratio of specialists and generalists across the family.

We further explored the evolutionary trajectory between specialism and generalism by examining the transition rates between them, assuming discrete states. Using maximum
likelihood, we found that the transition rate from specialist to generalist was almost twice as likely as the shift from generalist to specialist $\left(2.06 \times 10^{-1}\right.$ and $9.41 \times 10^{-2}$, respectively; Figure 3b).

One explanation for an apparent greater transition rate toward generalism might be a higher extinction rate of specialist fungi (Farrell et al., 2021); thus, some evolutionary transitions toward a narrower set of hosts could go unobserved (Igic et al., 2004). We therefore evaluated the relationship between transition rates and speciation and extinction rates using the BiSSE (Fitzjohn, 2012; Maddison et al., 2007). While we detected a higher extinction rate for specialists ( $\mu=1.5 \times 10^{7}$ ) than for generalists ( $\mu=3.0 \times 10^{8}$ ), comparisons with a null in which we enforced equal extinction rates for both specialists and generalists did not indicate statistical support for the two-rate model ( $\chi^{2}=3.27 \times 10^{-5}, \quad p>0.05$, from ANOVA of the two-rate model vs. the equal rate model), and the model in which transitions to generalism were more frequent was again preferred.

Because host generalism can be quantified across a continuous spectrum, we extended our analysis to consider transitions between hierarchical levels of generalism and specialism: (1) 1-2 hosts-specialists, (2) $3-4$ hosts, (3) $5-6$ hosts, (4) $7-8$ hosts, (5) $9-10$ hosts, (6) $11-15$ hosts, (7) $16-20$ hosts, (8) $21-50$ hosts, (9) 51-100 hosts, and (10) $100+$ hosts-hyper-generalists. We find that transition rates from level (1) (1-2 hosts) to (3) (5-6 hosts), and from level (4) to (6) were at least one order of magnitude higher than other transitions increasing host breadth (Figure 3c). Similarly, transitions decreasing the number of hosts were also higher from level (6) to (4) and from (3) to (2) than transitions between these groupings. Surprisingly, transitions from highly specialist levels (1) and (2) to broad generalism (9) were also relatively frequent.

\section*{Variation in host range appears to be strongly influenced by external factors}

Finally, we explored the possibility that escape from geographical limitations allows Botryosphaeriaceae to expand their host range. Collecting data on the plant species used by humans from the WEP database (US National Plant Germplasm System, 2024), we found a significant positive relation between the number of hosts and the association with plants widely used by humans and, therefore, likely subjected to anthropogenic movement. We further evaluated this trend using V. vinifera, M. indica, and Eucalyptus spp., as exemplar economically important crops (Figure 4a), and found strong support for greater host breadth among pathogens

associated with these crops (from pgls: (1) presence in $V$. vinifera $t$ value $=5.38, F$-statistic $=28.95$ on 1 and $194 \mathrm{df}, p<0.001$; (2) presence in M. indica $t$ value = 4.33, $F$-statistic $=18.78$ on 1 and $194 \mathrm{df}, p<0.001$; (3) presence in Eucalyptus spp. $t$ value $=4.53, F$-statistic $=20.52$ on 1 and $194 \mathrm{df}, p<0.001$ ). We also found significantly greater host breadth among fungi associated with hosts in the WEP database (Figure 4b, mean host breadth: 32.32 vs. 1.79, for fungi associated with plants of human use vs. host breadth of fungi not associated with human-used hosts, respectively, $t$ value $=-4.738, \mathrm{df}=198.15, p<0.001$, Welch two-sample $t$ test). This trend remained after accounting for the possible bias toward Botryosphaeriaceae with wider host ranges including economically important plants within their host set by chance, with a strong trend toward larger SES (greater proportion of economically important plants among their hosts set than predicted from the null of random sampling of host taxa) among generalist fungi (Figure 4c; linear model, multiple $r^{2}=0.259$, slope $=0.02, p<0.001$ ).

\section*{DISCUSSION}

Fungi are among the most common and economically important pathogens causing emerging infectious diseases in plants (Anderson et al., 2004). However, the factors shaping fungal-plant associations and driving the emergence of pathogenic fungi in novel hosts are still not well understood. We examined patterns of host associations in the Botryosphaeriaceae, a fungal family containing many highly virulent pathogens of plants. Exploring pathogen and host phylogenies, we found strong phylogenetic conservatism in fungal-plant interactions across both. We also show that host generalism is more common than specialism in the Botryosphaeriaceae and that the evolutionary transition rate from specialism to generalism is higher than the reverse pathway. We additionally identify surprisingly frequent transitions from specialism to hyper-generalism. We
suggest that, in addition to phylogenetic constraints to plant-fungal associations, geographical factors likely influence the realized host breadth of fungi by limiting the plant hosts they are exposed to. We show a greater host range in fungi with plant hosts used by humans. We propose that the human movement of plants has allowed some associated fungi to escape ecological and evolutionary constraints on host range and may explain the emergence of hyper-generalist pathogens in this family.

\section*{The Botryosphaeriaceae phylogeny}

The Botryosphaeriaceae fungal family contains a wide and diverse group of species, many of them known for their damaging effects on plant health. However, the classification of this fungal taxon has been a challenge since its first description in 1918 (Theissen \& Sydow, 1918), with multiple efforts worldwide to resolve the Botryosphaeriaceae taxonomy (Burgess et al., 2019; Crous et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2013; Schoch et al., 2006; Slippers et al., 2004; Wingfield et al., 2012). The presence of cryptic species led to the questioning of the taxonomic status of several lineages (Pavlic et al., 2009). Following phylogenetic analyses with new and more sensitive molecular tools, several species have been synonymized in the last few years (Yang, Groenewald, et al., 2017; Zhang, Groenewald, et al., 2021), and multigene phylogenies and whole-genome sequencing have provided additional information on evolutionary relationships (Garcia et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022). Here, we reconstruct a comprehensive phylogeny of the Botryosphaeriaceae, providing new insights into their evolutionary history, and use it to explore host-pathogen associations.

We compiled a large multigene matrix, with both wide breadth of sampling and robust molecular coverage (ensuring all sampled isolates had sequences for at least

three of the following genes: ITS, ttub2, tef, LSU, and $r p b 2$ ). This allowed us to maximize the information content for phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution. Obtaining representative sequences for some genera (e.g., Botryobambusa and Mucoharknessia) remained challenging; however, our aim here was not to present a formal taxonomic review of species but rather to use the information on fungal phylogenetic relationships to explore their interaction with plant hosts. Several studies have highlighted the challenge in identifying species and isolates within complexes, such as the N. parvum complex (Ko et al., 2023; Pavlic et al., 2009; Zhang, Groenewald, et al., 2021), which could influence downstream analyses. By using multiple genes for identification and focusing on species versus isolate determination, we reduce the impact of misidentification of problematic fungal species. The inferred Botryosphaeriaceae phylogeny we present here was reconstructed using the largest number of sequences for a tree of the family yet published and is congruent with other recent reconstructions in the literature derived for smaller taxon sets (Garcia et al., 2021; Rathnayaka et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2022).

\section*{Phylogenetic signal in host-fungal associations}

A considerable amount of research has been centered on the phylogenetic conservatism of host use by pests but has largely ignored the evolutionary history of those pests, mainly because we generally have a better
knowledge of plant phylogenies than the phylogenies of pests or pathogens (Gougherty \& Davies, 2021; Smith \& Brown, 2018). However, considering both host and pest phylogenies can give us a deeper understanding of their associations (Gougherty \& Davies, 2021; Morris \& Moury, 2019). We first examined the strength of phylogenetic conservatism across pathogen and host phylogenies independently to assess the importance of both sides of the interaction. We found strong clustering of pathogenic taxa associated with each host when quantified on the fungal phylogeny (Plant hosts, Figure 2c), and also strong clustering of plant hosts associated with each fungus when quantified on the plant phylogeny (Fungi, Figure 2c). Pathogen-host interactions frequently reflect evolutionary conservatism of traits such that related plant hosts tend to harbor similar pathogen species, and related pathogens tend to attack similar plant hosts (Gilbert \& Webb, 2007; Morris \& Moury, 2019). Our results broadly confirm this expectation: Fungi within Botryosphaeriaceae are typically restricted to closely related plants, and closely related Botryosphaeriaceae more frequently colonize the same hosts, which usually provide similar resources and defense strategies (Nylin et al., 2018).

While there is evidence for phylogenetic constraints across both phylogenies, we found a trend for stronger clustering of the plants used by Botryosphaeriaceae than for clustering of Botryosphaeriaceae on their plant hosts, suggesting a greater influence of the host phylogeny in determining their interaction. Results from the co-phylogenetic method proposed by Krasnov et al. (2012) were broadly consistent-closely related Botryosphaeriaceae/plant hosts
are more likely to co-occur in the same module than distantly related Botryosphaeriaceae/plant hosts. However, clusters of host-fungal associations within modules were structured by both host and pathogen phylogenies equally. Our results emphasize the importance of considering both phylogenetic dimensions-host and pathogen-to fully understand their associations.

Co-diversification provides one mechanism that can drive patterns of phylogenetic conservatism in species associations across host and pathogen phylogenies, where the divergence of a pathogen or pest lineage is the result of the divergence of its host lineage (Charleston \& Robertson, 2002). Using the co-phylogenetic method ParaFitGlobal, proposed by Legendre et al. (2002), we found that the phylogenetic structure in host-pest associations was consistent with a model of codivergence between Botryosphaeriaceae and their hosts. Co-diversification between animal parasites and their hosts has been widely reported (Alcala et al., 2017; Hadfield et al., 2014; Pfenning-Butterworth, Botero-Cañola, \& Cressler, 2021), but evidence in fungal plant pathogens is sparse (see example in Peterson et al., 2010). However, phylogenetically constrained host-shifts can give rise to similar patterns (Charleston \& Robertson, 2002; Mazel et al., 2018). Given the evolutionary depth of the pathogen phylogeny relative to the host phylogeny (seed plants-angiosperms and gymnosperms-date to around 246.6 Mya, while Botryosphaeriaceae date to 69.9 Mya; Morris et al., 2018; Rathnayaka et al., 2023), we suggest that a model of host switching is more likely to explain the patterns of pathogen-host associations we observe across the Botryosphaeriaceae.

While most fungi have a phylogenetically conserved host range, hyper-generalists such as B. dothidea, L. theobromae, M. phaseolina, and N. parvum, with over 10 times the number of known hosts than the Botryosphaeriaceae average, seem to be exceptions. The existence of generalists able to infect distantly related hosts has been described as the "parasite paradox" (Agosta et al., 2010). The paradox arises from the observation that pathogens and parasites tend to be resource specialists, leading to selection for constrained host ranges, and yet, jumps to unrelated hosts are common and observable in ecological time (Agosta et al., 2010). These hyper-generalist taxa within Botryosphaeriaceae thus further support the host-switching hypothesis over codivergence. Previous research suggested that "ecological fitting" could be one mechanism initializing host-switching, helping to resolve the parasite paradox (Agosta et al., 2010; Araujo et al., 2015). Originally proposed by Daniel Janzen (1985), the concept suggests that species can establish functional ecological associations without the need for long evolutionary histories, as they
can "fit" into new environments through pre-existing traits and phenotypic flexibility.

Ecological fitting of Botryosphaeriaceae hyper-generalist species in new environments could have allowed the quick emergence of new fungal-plant interactions through both intrinsic factors, for example, phenotypic plasticity and weak phylogenetic conservatism (Agosta et al., 2010; Agosta \& Klemens, 2008; Becerra, 1997; Blanco et al., 2018), and external factors, such as changes in biogeographical distribution due to, for example, release from dispersal limitations. Despite the finding of generally strong phylogenetic conservatism in host use, we show a surprising variation in host breadth among closely related Botryosphaeriaceae species (Figure 2), suggesting that heritable fungal traits do not easily explain the number of hosts each Botryosphaeriaceae infects. Host range across the Botryosphaeriaceae, therefore, appears to be an evolutionarily malleable trait with multiple evolutionary independent shifts toward wider and (sometimes) narrower host breadth across the family.

\section*{Transitions between specialism and generalism}

The evolution of host breadth has been an important focus of study in ecology and evolution over the past few decades (Futuyma \& Moreno, 1988; Janz \& Nylin, 2008; Visher \& Boots, 2020). The presence of specialist and generalist pathogens has been predominantly explained in the literature by the cost of generalism, which allows specialists to outcompete generalists in some contexts (MacArthur, 1984; Visher \& Boots, 2020). It has also been suggested that there is a general evolutionary tendency toward specialism based on the assumed trade-off between host resource use efficiency and generalism, where "a jack of all trades is a master of none" (Futuyma \& Moreno, 1988). While generalist pathogens are sometimes observed, it is suggested that there is typically a strong trend toward respecialization (Janz \& Nylin, 2008; Nylin et al., 2018), and specialists usually outnumber generalists (Sriswasdi et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2022). In previous work (Silva-Valderrama, Úrbez-Torres, \& Davies, 2024), we found that most Botryosphaeriaceae had narrow host ranges. Nonetheless, single-host specialists were infrequent, and as our sampling of hosts is almost certainly incomplete, we are likely even further biased to overestimating the number of specialists. It is not immediately clear why Botryosphaeriaceae should differ from other host-parasite systems in having a greater frequency of multihost pathogens.

If generalism were a transient state, as previously proposed, we might predict that generalists would be observed more frequently among younger taxa in the tree
(Nylin et al., 2018), because older taxa would have had more time to evolve toward specialism. However, we found no relation between Botryosphaeriaceae age and host breadth. Moreover, we find no evidence that evolutionary transitions from generalism to specialism are more frequent than the reverse; rather, we found the opposite to be true. The transition rate from specialists to generalists was almost twice as likely as the transition rates from generalism to specialism (Figure 3b).

Our results contrast with some previous findings across other taxa; for example, Sriswasdi et al. (2017) reported that the transition rate from environmental-generalist bacteria toward specialism was three fold faster than the reverse. Likewise, Padfield et al. (2024) reported that transition rates away from generalist states were five times higher than all rates toward it combined. It is possible that threats to plant diversity over the past decades (Corlett, 2016) have tended to increasingly favor generalists, as once common plant hosts become rarer, imposing pressure on parasites to either shift niche preferences or expand their diet breadth (Futuyma \& Moreno, 1988). It is also possible that we underestimated transitions from generalism to specialism; for example, if specialist fungi have higher extinction rates, we might miss transitions in now extinct taxa (Fitzjohn, 2012; Maddison et al., 2007). However, we did not find any evidence suggesting significantly higher extinction in specialists versus generalists, and when fit in a joint model, transition rates from specialism to generalism were still higher than the reverse.

We recognize that the binary classification of specialism and generalism we assume above might be too rigid. We, therefore, explored intermediate thresholds of generalism and specialism and found that transition rates between fungi with one or two hosts were broadly symmetrical, as were transitions between fungi with seven or eight hosts (Figure 3c). These transitions might be a behavioral and temporal response to competition, generating a dynamic balance between gaining and losing hosts. However, perhaps a more likely explanation is that uncertainty in true host breadth due to data gaps does not allow us to accurately distinguish between, for example, true single-host specialists and specialists found in two plant hosts. Thus, apparent transitions between single-host specialists and two-host specialists in our data might simply reflect sampling bias, explaining why they appear to be so frequent.

The blurred threshold between specialists and generalists could also be masking other patterns. For example, phenotypic plasticity can allow generalists to persist in alternative environments through ecological fitting, where selection might favor subsequent adaptation to a novel host (Mason, 2016). However, such hosts are often considered to be deviations rather than indicative of
transitions toward increasing generalism (Nylin et al., 2018). To distinguish between true hosts versus spillover or transient hosts, other factors should be considered, such as the virulence of the fungi, which might be related to resource use efficiency and fungal adaptation to a given host. Future studies linking host breadth and virulence could, therefore, help us to better understand the boundary between generalists and specialists.

Host breadth is not a static property. The expansion of increment of host breadth via formation of novel species association through host-switching and ecological fitting is not an endpoint (Agosta \& Klemens, 2008). The increasing transition of Botryosphaeriaceae fungi toward generalism could also be indicative of an expansion phase within the clade (Agosta \& Klemens, 2008; Janzen, 1985), a product of their current broadening geographical extent and, therefore, part of a broader host-breadth cycle. The oscillation hypothesis (Janz \& Nylin, 2008) links the diversity of pathogens to oscillations in their host plant range. Pathogens may, therefore, alternate between broadening their host breadth and specializing in fewer plant species over evolutionary time. The presence of hyper-generalists might then be a transient phase fueled by increasing opportunities of new interactions and ecological fitting but could, in time, give rise to a specialization phase in which fungi evolve to specialize on their new hosts. Our findings regarding the age of generalists and specialists and evidence for transitions both form and to increased generalism could be consistent with this hypothesis, with different taxa within Botryosphaeriaceae in different phases.

Strikingly, we observed surprisingly high transition rates from specialists (one to two hosts) to hyper-generalists, with over 100 plant-host species (Figure 3c). Such differences in host richness are unlikely to be explained by sampling bias alone, and we suggest that these large shifts in host breadth may be a result of geographical range expansion through the anthropological movement of plant and fungal species worldwide. If this is the case, then we could speculate that the vertiginous increase in host breadth of these hyper-generalists will eventually be limited by world geography. Novel interactions within introduced regions might then give rise to new fungal specialists, reinitiating the cycle.

\section*{Anthropogenic influence on Botryosphaeriaceae host breadth}

The introduction of plant species into new geographical locations has not only allowed native pathogens to interact with these introduced plants but has also provided an opportunity for spillover of pathogens of the introduced plants to the native plant community. In the past century,
the plantation area of agriculturally important species, including V. vinifera (World Wine Production Outlook OIV First Estimates, 2022), Eucalyptus spp. (Burgess \& Wingfield, 2017; Iglesias-Trabado \& Wilstermann, 2008), and M. indica (Liu et al., 2023), has expanded dramatically. Eucalyptus spp., for example, are some of the most widely planted tree species in the world, with forestry plantations in over 95 countries (Zhang \& Wang, 2021). Most species are endemic to Australia (Yost et al., 2021), but many have been moved around the globe to produce pulp, paper, and wood, and pathogens have moved with them. Several fungi of the genus Teratosphaeria have likely been co-introduced with their Eucalyptus hosts (Burgess \& Wingfield, 2017), and native pathogens, such as Puccinia psidii (Glen et al., 2007) and Cryphonectria spp., have emerged on introduced Eucalyptus (Burgess \& Wingfield, 2017; Wingfield, 2003). Fungi within Botryosphaeriaceae that are associated with Eucalyptus have thus been exposed to a large number of potential hosts and opportunities for host range expansion.

We show that generalist Botryosphaeriaceae are disproportionately associated with economically important crops such as Eucalyptus spp., M. indica, and V. vinifera (Figure 4), and that fungi associated with plant hosts of human use have, on average, greater host ranges than fungi associated with plant hosts not used by humans. The anthropogenic movement of crops and domesticated plants has likely allowed some Botryosphaeriaceae to overcome the natural geographical limitations to their host distributions. In addition, crop management practices could have favored higher diversity of fungal species in agricultural plants. For example, increased pathogen susceptibility could result from trade-offs in plant breeding that selects for traits that favor higher productivity (Silva-Valderrama, Úrbez-Torres, \& Davies, 2024), and because the spread rate of a pathogen is proportional to the density of susceptible hosts (Burdon \& Chilvers, 2003; Gilbert \& Webb, 2007), the dense planting of crops in monocultures likely further amplifies the ecological opportunity for plant-pathogen interactions. Greater investment in research of economically important crops can, however, generate a sampling bias, leading us to artifactually record a higher number of pathogens in these hosts (Gramaje et al., 2018; Jayawardena et al., 2018; Silva-Valderrama, Úrbez-Torres, \& Davies, 2024). Nonetheless, we were able to show that the frequency of economically important crops among the hosts of fungi with wide host breadth was significantly greater than expected by chance.

We suggest that the extreme relaxation of dispersal limitation through human movement of plant species might provide the explanation for the recent and rapid expansion of Botryosphaeriaceae host breadth. Araujo
et al. (2015) identify the two critical steps necessary for new interactions to establish as (i) opportunity, where potential associates must coexist in time and space; and (ii) compatibility, where the resources for colonization, spread, and persistence are present. The opportunity for an increased number of interactions provided by the anthropogenic movement of plant species, and an ability to maintain fitness in a novel host and environment-ecological fitting (Agosta \& Klemens, 2008)-provided by phenotypic plasticity and relaxed phylogenetic niche conservatism may have acted together to promote the emergence of Botryosphaeriaceae hyper-generalists that we see nowadays.

\section*{CONCLUSION}

Fungi within the Botryosphaeriaceae include single-host specialists and hyper-generalists found on $>100$ plant species, but the majority of species might be classified as moderate generalists. We show evidence of phylogenetic conservatism in fungal-plant interaction, where both pathogen and plant phylogenies inform their association. Individual fungi, therefore, tend to infect closely related plant hosts, and a given plant host is likely to be susceptible to infection from closely related fungal parasites. However, we found that single-host specialists are rare within the Botryosphaeriaceae and that there is a higher rate of evolutionary transitions toward generalism than to specialism, contrary to theory suggesting that generalism is a transient state. We suggest that biogeographical factors and the anthropological movement of economically important crop species around the globe might be important in explaining the large variation in host breadth of fungi within the family and the presence of hyper-generalists. Botryosphaeriaceae species associated with widely planted crops, such as Eucalyptus, V. vinifera, and M. indica, have had greater opportunity to spill over onto novel hosts and expand their host range. Furthermore, the dense planting of agricultural crops, often in monoculture, likely facilitated spillover of native pathogens onto these introduced species. Understanding the factors that determine pathogen host range can aid in predicting the risk of emerging Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, helping to inform efficient regulatory policies in international trade in plant and plant-derived products, and influence the design of agricultural systems to reduce the host breadth expansion and emergence of pathogenic fungi.

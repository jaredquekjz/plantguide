Key words: alternative functional designs, demography, intraspecific trait variation, multiple performance peaks, performance landscapes, trait $\times$ environment interactions.
- That functional traits should affect individual performance and, in turn, determine fitness and population growth, is a foundational assumption of trait-based ecology. This assumption is, however, not supported by a strong empirical base.
- Here, we measured simultaneously two individual performance metrics (survival and growth), seven traits and 10 environmental properties for each of 3981 individuals of 205 species in a 50 -ha stem-mapped subtropical forest. We then modelled survival/growth as a function of traits, environments and trait $\times$ environment interactions, and quantified their relative importance at both the species and individual levels.
- We found evidence of alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks along environmental gradients, indicating the presence of complicated trait $\times$ environment interactions. However, such interactions were relatively unimportant in our site, which had relatively low environmental variations. Moreover, individual performance was not better predicted, and trait $\times$ environment interactions were not more likely detected, at the individual level than at the species level.
- Although the trait $\times$ environment interactions might be safely ignored in relatively homogeneous environments, we encourage future studies to test the interactive effects of traits and environments on individual performances and lifelong fitness at larger spatial scales or along experimentally manipulated environmental gradients.

\section*{Introduction}

The trait-based approach has emerged as a promising way to understand the mechanisms of species coexistence and processes of community assembly (McGill et al., 2006; Laughlin et al., 2012; Kraft et al., 2015; Lusk \& Laughlin, 2017), to predict the distribution of organisms along environmental gradients (Chapin et al., 1993; Westoby et al., 2002), and to explain the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Lavorel \& Garnier, 2002; Cadotte, 2017). This approach is built on the assumption that 'functional' traits should affect individual performance (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction), which in turn determine fitness and population growth (Violle et al., 2007; Laughlin \& Messier, 2015; Shipley et al., 2016; Struckman et al., 2019; Treurnicht et al., 2020). The entire discipline of traitbased ecology will be at risk if this foundational assumption is not reinforced by a strong empirical base (Shipley et al., 2016), which is still weak and fragmentary. For instance, those studies that empirically tested this assumption have reported typically

weak or nonexistent trait-performance relationships (e.g. Poorter et al., 2008; Kraft et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2010; Adler et al., 2014; Paine et al., 2015).

One important reason why traits alone might poorly predict performance is that the effects of traits on individual performance should depend on the environment (Laughlin \& Messier, 2015; Yang et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020), because no organism would have optimal adaptation to all relevant environments at the same time (i.e. a Darwinian demon). Recently, a few empirical studies have detected significant interactive effects between some traits and environments on individual performance (Blonder et al., 2018; Laughlin et al., 2018; Zirbel \& Brudvig, 2020). For example, specific leaf area is positively related to survival probability at low soil $\mathrm{C}: \mathrm{N}$ ratio, but negatively correlated to survival probability at high soil $\mathrm{C}: \mathrm{N}$ ratio (Laughlin et al., 2018). However, these studies consider only interactions between one trait and one environment, ignoring the multidimensional nature of phenotypic traits and environments (Laughlin, 2014; Laughlin \& Messier, 2015). Therefore, testing the interactive effects of multiple traits and environments via the inclusion of higher-order trait $\times$ trait $\times$ environment $\times$ environment interactions is an
important next step towards understanding the effects of whole-organism phenotypes on individual performance in different environments (Laughlin et al., 2018). Specifically, the inclusion of such higher-order interactions between traits and environments enables us to explore performance landscapes (mapping performance on multiple trait axes) and the possibility of multiple optima along environmental gradients (Laughlin \& Messier, 2015). Each optimum represents an alternative functional design (a specific trait combination) of approximately equal performance in a given environment (Marks \& Lechowicz, 2006). To our knowledge, Worthy et al. (2020) is the only example to date that has empirically tested higher-order trait $\times$ trait $\times$ environment interactions and found evidence of alternative designs and multiple growth performance peaks. That study did not consider other performance metrics besides growth nor the multidimensional nature of the environment. Therefore, more comprehensive studies that test the interactive effects of multiple traits and multiple environments on different measures of individual performances are necessary.

One practical barrier that hinders the empirical test of trait $\times$ environment interactions (especially the higher-order interactions) is the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data regarding individual performances, traits and environments for accurate estimation of numerous parameters (Laughlin et al., 2018). Therefore, it is not enough to just simply identify such significant trait $\times$ environment interactions, as done in previous studies (Blonder et al., 2018; Laughlin et al., 2018; Worthy et al., 2020; Zirbel \& Brudvig, 2020). It is also necessary to explicitly quantify the relative importance of such trait $\times$ environment interactions to individual performance, because this tells us how much information one might lose when ignoring these complicated trait $\times$ environment interactions. If trait $\times$ environment interactions contribute little information to the prediction of individual performance, we can ignore these interactions without introducing substantial bias of estimating trait-performance relationships. For example, these interactions might be safely ignored in sites with relatively homogenous environments because the importance of trait $\times$ environment interactions for predicting plant performance would logically increase with the heterogeneity of environments. Otherwise, trait $\times$ environment interactions would be necessary despite the challenge of obtaining sufficient data. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies quantifying the relative importance of trait $\times$ environment interactions to know when such interactions can be safely ignored.

Another reason for the surprisingly weak trait-performance relationships reported so far is the shortcut of characterising all individuals of a species with its species mean trait value (Yang et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020). This shortcut implicitly assumes that interspecific trait variation is far greater than intraspecific trait variation. However, intraspecific trait variation, arising from phenotypic plasticity and genetic diversity, has been acknowledged as a substantial source of trait variation in a growing number of studies (e.g. Albert et al., 2010; Messier et al., 2010; Siefert et al., 2015). Moreover, phenotypic plasticity may enable individuals of a species to adjust their trait values to a certain extent in order to better adapt to their local environments (Gratani, 2014), and thus trait-performance relationships will
likely be stronger when evaluated at the individual level (Yang et al., 2018; Swenson et al., 2020). However, few studies have empirically tested trait-performance relationships at both the species and individual levels to see if the models using individual level traits would outperform the ones using species mean traits (but see Liu et al., 2016), and further tested if trait $\times$ environment interactions are more likely to be detected at the individual level than at the species level.

In this study, we measured two performance metrics (survival and growth), seven traits and 10 environmental properties for each of 3981 individuals of 205 species in a 50-ha stem-mapped subtropical forest plot. Using this large dataset, we modelled sizedependent individual survival/growth as a function of traits, environments and their interactions (including the higher-order ones) at both the species and individual levels to address the following questions:
(1) Do alternative functional designs (multiple performance peaks) exist in a given environment and (if exist) how do they shift along multiple environmental gradients?

A single optimum for a given environment and different optima for different environments are often assumed in single trait and environment analyses (Enquist et al., 2015; Laughlin, 2018). With the inclusion of higher-order trait $\times$ trait $\times$ environment $\times$ environment interactions, alternative functional designs are expected for a given environment and either same or different optima are possible for different environments.
(2) What is the relative importance of the trait $\times$ environment interactions to individual survival and growth?

Their relative importance is expected to decline with decreasing environmental heterogeneity and might be safely ignored in relatively homogenous environments.
(3) Are individual survival and growth better predicted, and trait $\times$ environment interactions more likely detected, at the individual level than at the species level?

This would be true when intraspecific trait variation is substantial responding to the changing environments.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\section*{Study site}

The study was conducted in a 50 -ha forest dynamic plot within the Heishiding Provincial Nature Reserve $\left(23^{\circ} 27^{\prime} \mathrm{N}, 111^{\circ} 52^{\prime} \mathrm{E}\right.$; altitude: 150-927 m asl), Guangdong Province, southern China. The region has a subtropical moist monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of $19.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and mean annual precipitation of c. 1740 mm . The monthly mean temperature ranges from $10.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in January to $28.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in July, and the precipitation falls predominantly ( $79 \%$ ) from April to September. The vegetation, characterised by an evergreen broadleaved forest, is dominated by the Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Theaceae families.

\section*{Demographic data}

The 50-ha plot ( $1000 \mathrm{~m} \times 500 \mathrm{~m}$ ) was established following the ForestGEO (https://www.forestgeo.si.edu) protocol in 2011.

The first census was completed in 2013 with all free-standing individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) more than 1 cm being tagged, mapped, measured and identified to species. About 273000 free-standing stems belonging to 245 species, 160 genera and 71 families were recorded. The second census was finished in 2017, in which we recorded the status ( 0 for dead and 1 for alive) and DBH of all individuals recorded in the first census. The individual relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated as [log $\left.\left(\mathrm{DBH}_{2}\right)-\log \left(\mathrm{DBH}_{1}\right)\right] / 5$, where $\mathrm{DBH}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{DBH}_{2}$ are DBH recorded in the two censuses.

\section*{Functional traits}

We measured seven traits including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA), wood density (WD) and wood dry matter content (WDMC), on 3981 individuals of 205 species randomly distributed within the 50-ha plot (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Details on how these traits were sampled and measured can be found in our previous studies (Chen, 2015; He \& Deane, 2016; He \& Biswas, 2019). These traits have been reported to have effects on survival and growth rates (Poorter et al., 2008; Kraft et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2010; Adler et al., 2014). For example, light-demanding species with high growth and mortality rates tend to have larger SLA and LNC, but smaller WD than shadetolerant species with low growth and mortality rates (Adler et al., 2014). We performed principal component analyses for

\section*{Environmental conditions}

In total, 625 surface soil samples ( $0-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ depth), randomly distributed within the 50 -ha plot, were collected during the summer of 2016. Nine soil properties for each soil sample were measured with detailed methods shown in Table S1. Two orthogonal soil properties (Fig. 1b), soil organic matter (SOM) and soil acidity $(\mathrm{pH})$, were selected in the following analyses. Soils with higher SOM had more total nitrogen, total phosphorus and available nitrogen, while soils with higher pH had more available phosphorus, available potassium and higher sand content. In addition, the understory light availability was estimated using hemispherical photography at 2352 places randomly distributed within the 50-ha plot (Zhao \& He, 2016). The SOM, soil pH and light availability were interpolated to grids of $10 \mathrm{~m} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}$ using the Ordinary Kriging in the automap package (Hiemstra et al., 2009) to estimate the environmental conditions in which the individuals were located; predictions in the grids that contained observations were replaced with the average of the observations in the grids (Fig. S1).

\section*{Data analysis}

To explore interactive effects of multivariate traits and multivariate environments, we modelled individual performance ( $Z$, survival or growth) as a function of: (1) a size effect (DBH), (2) main effects of two traits ( $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{2}$ ) and two environments ( $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ ), as well as (3) their two-way, (4) three-way, and (5) fourway interactions with a general form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
Z= & \alpha+\gamma_{\text {species }}+\delta_{\text {quadrat }}+\beta_{1} \cdot D B H+\beta \cdot T_{1} \times T_{2} \times E_{1} \times E_{2} \\
= & \alpha+\underbrace{\gamma_{\text {species }}+\delta_{\text {quadrat }}}_{\text {random effects }}+\underbrace{\beta_{1} \cdot D B H}_{\text {size effect }}+\underbrace{\beta_{2} \cdot T_{1}+\beta_{3} \cdot T_{2}+\beta_{4} \cdot E_{1}+\beta_{5} \cdot E_{2}}_{\text {main effects }}+ \\
& \underbrace{\beta_{6} \cdot T_{1}: T_{2}+\beta_{7} \cdot T_{1}: E_{1}+\beta_{8} \cdot T_{1}: E_{2}+\beta_{9} \cdot T_{2}: E_{1}+\beta_{10} \cdot T_{2}: E_{2}+\beta_{11} \cdot E_{1}: E_{2}}_{\text {two-way }}+ \\
& \underbrace{\beta_{12} \cdot T_{1}: T_{2}: E_{1}+\beta_{13} \cdot T_{1}: T_{2}: E_{2}+\beta_{14} \cdot T_{1}: E_{1}: E_{2}+\beta_{15} \cdot T_{2}: E_{1}: E_{2}}_{\text {three-way }}+\underbrace{\beta_{16} \cdot T_{1}: T_{2}: E_{1}: E_{2}}_{\text {four-way }}
\end{aligned}
\]
these traits and found that the first two principal components captured $64 \%$ variation of the seven traits (Fig. 1a). One dimension runs from individuals with 'conservative' leaves (low SLA, LNC and LPC, and high LDMC) to individuals with 'acquisitive' leaves (high SLA, LNC and LPC, and low LDMC), correlated with the world-wide leaf economics spectrum (Wright et al., 2004; Shipley et al., 2006; Díaz et al., 2016). The other dimension runs from individuals with low LA, high WD and WDMC to individuals with high LA, low WD and WDMC. This negative relationship between LA and WD has been reported in some previous studies (Cavender-Bares et al., 2004; Pickup et al., 2005; Wright et al., 2007), probably because individuals with lower wood density usually have higher hydraulic conductivity and thus can transport more water to support larger leaves (Wright et al., 2007).

We built linear mixed models of individual performance, treating survival ( 0 for death and 1 for survival) as a binomial-family model with a logit link function and growth (log-transformation of RGR) as a Gaussian-family model with an identity link function, respectively. Two random effects were considered. First, we included random intercepts across species ( $\gamma_{\text {species }}$ ) to account for species-level differences in survival and growth that were unrelated to the traits. Second, we divided the 50 -ha plot into 1250 $(20 \mathrm{~m} \times 20 \mathrm{~m})$ quadrats and included random intercepts across quadrats ( $\delta_{\text {quadrat }}$ ) to account for spatial autocorrelation. We computed the $R^{2}$-marginal (variance explained by all the fixed effects) and $R^{2}$-conditional (variance explained by both fixed and random effects) using the function r.squaredGLMM in the MuMIn package (Zuur et al., 2009). We further partitioned the $R^{2}$-marginal to quantify the relative contribution of the size effect

The seven traits, that is leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), wood density (WD) and wood dry matter content (WDMC), were simultaneously measured on 3981 individuals of 205 species within the 50 -ha forest plot. The first two principal components explain c. $64 \%$ of total trait variation. The nine soil properties, that is soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and sand content (Sand), were measured for 625 soil samples randomly collected within the 50-ha forest plot.

(DBH), main effects of two traits and two environments, and their two-way, three-way and four-way interactions to the variance explained by fixed effects (Notes S1).

The above analyses were repeated for 36 models with different combinations of two independent traits ( $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{2}$ ) and two independent environments ( $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ ) for individual survival and growth, respectively. The first trait of the pair ( $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ ) was selected from the four traits relating to the first dimension (SLA, LNC, LPC and LDMC) and the second trait of the pair ( $\mathrm{T}_{2}$ ) was selected from the three traits relating to the second dimension (LA, WD and WDMC) (Fig. 1a). The two environments ( $E_{1}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ ) were the pairwise combinations of SOM, pH and light. The predictors DBH, LA, SLA, LNC and LPC and light availability were log-transformed to better approximate normality and all fixed predictors were then scaled to unit variance before analyses. To control the false discovery rate, we adjusted the $P$-values for each parameter estimation of 36 models using the Ben-jamini-Hochberg correction (Benjamini \& Hochberg, 1995; Chen et al., 2017). All these models were run at both the species and individual levels. To explore the occurrence of alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks, we constructed 3D plots (performance landscapes) displaying how logitsurvival or $\log$-RGR varied along with two trait axes at four extreme environmental conditions (combinations of minimum and maximum observed values of the two environmental variables used in the model) in the plot3D package (Soetaert, 2019). All analyses were done in R v.3.6.2 (R Core Team, 2019).

\section*{Results}

\section*{Summary of individual performance models}

The standardised coefficients, their significance and model fit statistics of the 36 models ( $\mathrm{Z} \approx \mathrm{DBH}+\mathrm{T} 1 \times \mathrm{T} 2 \times \mathrm{E} 1 \times \mathrm{E} 2$ ) for
survival and growth at both the species and individual levels are summarised in Tables S2-S5. Individual size (DBH) was always positively correlated with survival probability but negatively correlated with RGR (Tables S2-S5). Out of the 36 survival models, most of them detected significant main effects (of traits rather than environments), but only a few models detected significant two-way, three-way and four-way interactions at both the species and individual levels (Table 1). Modelling survival probability at the individual level did not detect more trait $\times$ environment interactions (except for the three-way interactions) than at the species level (Table 1). Out of the 36 growth models, most of them detected the significant main effects of traits or environments and their two-way interactions, but a few models detected significant three-way and four-way interactions (Table 1). Modelling RGR at the individual level did not increase the detection of two-way, three-way or four-way interactions than at the species level. In addition, both survival and growth were only slightly better modelled (the $R^{2}$-marginal and $R^{2}$-conditional were higher) at the individual level than at the species level in most cases (Tables S2-S5).

\section*{Performance landscapes at extreme environmental conditions}

We selected one survival model and one growth model with significant four-way interaction as an example to display the performance landscapes and explore the occurrence of functional alternative designs and performance peaks along environmental gradients. For the survival model with a significant four-way interaction between LNC, WDMC, SOM and pH at the species level, we found two survival peaks in each of the four extreme environments (Fig. 2). Specifically, in environments with minimum observed values of SOM and pH (or maximum SOM and pH ), the survival probability peaked for individuals of high LNC

and low WDMC as well as for individuals of low LNC and high WDMC (Fig. 2a,d). In environments with maximum SOM and minimum pH (or minimum SOM and maximum pH ), the survival probability peaked for individuals of low LNC and low WDMC as well as for individuals of high LNC and high WDMC (Fig. 2b,c). For the growth model with a significant four-way interaction between SLA, WD, pH and light at the species level, we also found two growth peaks in each of four extreme environments (Fig. 3). In environments with minimum observed values of pH and light (or maximum pH and light), the RGR peaked for individuals of low SLA and WD as well as for individuals of high SLA and WD (Fig. 3a,d). While in environments with maximum pH and minimum light (or minimum pH and maximum light), the RGR peaked for individuals of low SLA and high WD as well as for individuals of high SLA and low WD (Fig. 3b,c).

\section*{Relative importance of trait $\times$ environment interactions}

On average, the fixed and random effects explain c. $30 \%$ of the variation in survival and growth at both the species and individual levels (Fig. 4). We further portioned the variance explained by fixed effects to estimate the relative contribution of the size effect (DBH), the main effects of two traits and two environments and their interactions. For the survival models analysed at the species level, the explained variance due to the size effect (DBH), main effects of two traits and two environments and their interactions (sum of two-way, three-way and four-way interactions) were, on average, $41 \%, 43 \%$ and $16 \%$, respectively (Fig. 4a). The results at the individual level were generally the same as the results at the species level (Fig. 4b). However, the trait $\times$ environment interactions on average accounted for less than $5 \%$ of the explained variance of the growth models

\section*{Discussion}

Despite the importance of trait $\times$ environment interactions to individual performance and the resulting population dynamics and composition of communities (Laughlin \& Messier, 2015; Shipley et al., 2016), such interactions have been empirically tested in only a few studies (Blonder et al., 2018; Laughlin et al., 2018; Worthy et al., 2020; Zirbel \& Brudvig, 2020). By measuring the two individual performance metrics (survival and growth), seven functional traits and 10 environmental conditions for thousands of individuals in a subtropical forest, we have been able to explicitly test for more complicated interactions at both the species and individual levels. Because of the high levels of statistical power provided by our data (Notes S2; Fig. S2), we detected a few significant two-way (e.g. an interaction between LDMC and SOM on individual survival at the species level), three-way (e.g. an interaction between LPC, pH and light on individual survival at the species level), and four-way interactions (e.g. an interaction between LNC, WDMC, SOM and pH on individual survival at the species level) involving the survival and growth models at both the species and individual levels (Tables 1, S2-S5).

Two-way (one trait $\times$ one environment) interactions had been reported to affect individual survival probability (Laughlin et al., 2018), seedling establishment (Zirbel \& Brudvig, 2020) and multiple demographic rates (Blonder et al., 2018). With the inclusion of three-way interactions between two traits and one environment, Worthy et al. (2020) found alternative functional designs and multiple growth peaks and they shifted along environmental gradients. In our study, we found multiple performance peaks, not only for growth but also for survival, in a few models with significant three-way and four-way interactions (Table 1). As examples illustrated in 3D plots (Figs 2, 3), the performance landscapes became more complicated in the presence of significant four-way interactions. First, the existence of alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks (Figs 2, 3) means that there is not a single optimal trait (or trait combination) value for an environment. Given this, the correlations between community-weighted mean traits and environments can be unreliable estimates of the adaptive value of traits (Laughlin et al., 2018), which requires higher-order moments of communitylevel trait distributions like community-weighted variances to be considered (Shipley, 2010; Loranger et al., 2018). Second, the alternative functional designs and multiple performance peaks shifted along environmental gradients and thus the same strategy might be favoured in contrasting environments (Figs 2, 3). This surprising result contrasts with common expectations that different optima should be favoured in different environments and that environmental heterogeneity increases functional diversity (Stark et al., 2017). Finally, different performance landscapes for survival and growth can obscure our understanding of how traits affect lifelong fitness (Caswell, 1989). Future studies should
integrate effects of traits on different measures of performance to explore the overall fitness landscapes and estimate population growth (Struckman et al., 2019).

The presence of trait $\times$ environment interactions (especially the three-way and four-way interactions) points to the potential for the types of complications described above. Such interactions, however, contributed a relatively small proportion of the total explained variance in most cases in our plot (Table S6; Fig. 4). This is good news because it means that trait-performance relationships might be simple in many situations and we may not lose much information if we simply ignore these complicated interactions. If this is generally true, then the estimated trait-performance relationships without considering traits $\times$ environment interactions in many prior studies (e.g. Poorter et al., 2008; Kraft et al., 2010; Adler et al., 2014) did not introduce large errors in their estimates. The above conclusion must be qualified, because the importance of trait $\times$ environment interactions would logically increase with increasing environmental heterogeneity. We suspect that the small proportion of significant trait $\times$ environment interactions and their generally small contributions to individual performance in our study, is due to the fact that our study was conducted within a 50 -ha plot in a well established forest that had low environmental variation relative to other studies. The coefficients of variance of SOM, soil pH and light availability are lower in our plot, relative to a pine forest in Arizona (Laughlin et al., 2018), a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna (Worthy et al., 2020) and abandoned fields in southwestern Michigan (Zirbel \& Brudvig, 2020) (Table S7). In addition, significant trait $\times$ temperature and trait $\times$ precipitation interactions on individual survival were also found (Laughlin et al., 2018), but temperature and precipitation were often assumed to be the same at local scales like in our study. Although trait $\times$ environment interactions might be safely ignored in relatively homogeneous environments at local scales, we encourage future studies to test the interactive effects of traits and environments on individual performance at larger spatial scales (e.g. across forest sites) or along experimentally manipulated environmental gradients. Another, but less likely, reason for the unimportance of trait $\times$ environment interactions is that these commonly measured traits failed to effectively capture the individual response to the environments (Yang et al., 2018). If this was the case, the inclusion of more relevant trait $\times$ environment interactions should improve our predictions of individual performance.

Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals of a species to adjust their traits to better adapt to local environments (Gratani, 2014), thus trait-performance relationships can be greatly improved (Liu et al., 2016) and trait $\times$ environment interactions should be more likely to be detected at the individual level rather than at the species level. In contrast with our expectations, we did not observe this in our study (Tables 1, S2-S5). This also might be due to the small environmental variation in our plot. Individual adaptation to relatively homogeneous local environments led to much smaller intraspecific trait variation relative to interspecific trait variation (Fig. S3), therefore few benefits were obtained when considering this relatively small intraspecific trait variation at the individual level. In this case, characterising trait-
performance relationships at the species level were similarly effective to that at the individual level. However, we expect that intraspecific trait variation should be more substantial and play a more important role in studies confronting more heterogeneous environments at larger scales (Bolnick et al., 2011; Violle et al., 2012; Siefert et al., 2015).

Our study conducted a comprehensive test of the trait-performance relationship in a subtropical forest by simultaneously considering multiple performance metrics, interactions between multivariate traits and multivariate environments at both the species and individual levels. Although some traits and environments were found to have significant interactive effects on individual performance, they were not very important and inclusion of intraspecific variation did not improve the detection and importance of these interactions. We encourage future studies to test the interactive effects of traits and environments on different performance metrics at larger spatial scales (e.g. across forest sites) or along experimentally manipulated environmental gradients, and further integrate different measures of performance to estimate their effects on lifelong fitness and population growth.

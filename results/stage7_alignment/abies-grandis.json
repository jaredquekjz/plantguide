  "summary": "The plant profile generally aligns with the EIVE expectations, showing strong matches for moisture (M) and temperature (T). The light (L) and soil reaction (R) axes show partial agreement, as the plant's tolerance is wider than the EIVE scores suggest, though the stated preferences are consistent. No evidence was found for the nutrient (N) axis.",

      "verdict": "partial",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": "The profile indicates a very wide tolerance from full sun to shade. It is shade tolerant when young but grows optimally in full sun later. The 'semi-shade' expectation is a reasonable average for its life cycle but doesn't fully capture this developmental shift."

      "notes": "The profile's stated preference for 'slightly acid conditions' matches the expectation. However, the reported tolerated pH range of 5.0–7.2 is broader and extends further into neutral than the strongly acidic EIVE score implies."

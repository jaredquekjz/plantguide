# Proper AIC-Based Model Selection for Temperature

## Executive Summary

Re-implemented the structured regression workflow correctly by testing multiple model formulations BEFORE addressing multicollinearity. This proper implementation achieved R² = 0.528, outperforming our previous approach (R² = 0.522) that prematurely removed features via VIF reduction.

## Key Methodological Correction

### Previous (Flawed) Workflow
1. Black-box exploration (RF/XGBoost)
2. **Premature VIF reduction** → removed best features
3. AIC selection on reduced feature set
4. Result: R² = 0.522

### Corrected Workflow
1. Black-box exploration (RF/XGBoost)
2. Build multiple candidate models with ALL features
3. AIC selection to find optimal model
4. Address multicollinearity ONLY in winning model if needed
5. Result: R² = 0.528

## Model Comparison Results

Ten candidate models were tested based on black-box insights:

| Model | Description | AIC | R² | Parameters | Weight |
|-------|-------------|-----|-----|------------|--------|
| **rf_top10** ✓ | Top 10 RF features | 1521.4 | 0.528 | 11 | 0.571 |
| full | All features + interactions | 1522.7 | 0.542 | 19 | 0.292 |
| climate_all | All climate + traits | 1526.2 | 0.531 | 15 | 0.052 |
| poly_temp | Polynomial temperature | 1526.4 | 0.526 | 11 | 0.047 |
| interactions_top | Selected interactions | 1526.9 | 0.530 | 14 | 0.036 |
| climate_only | Climate without traits | 1531.9 | 0.514 | 7 | 0.003 |
| baseline | Traits only | 1871.9 | 0.107 | 7 | ~0 |

## Winning Model Analysis

### Formula
```r
y ~ tmax_mean + mat_mean + mat_q05 + mat_q95 + tmin_mean + 
    precip_mean + drought_min + logH + wood_cold + SIZE
```

### Key Features Retained
1. **Temperature metrics**: tmax_mean, mat_mean, tmin_mean (all three temperature dimensions)
2. **Derived climate**: mat_q05, mat_q95 (temperature quantiles)
3. **Moisture**: precip_mean, drought_min
4. **Traits**: logH (height), SIZE (composite)
5. **Interaction**: wood_cold (logSSD × tmin_mean) - critical for cold tolerance

### Multicollinearity Status
- **Aliased coefficient**: mat_q95 (perfectly correlated as it equals mat_mean + 1.645×mat_sd)
- **Acceptable for prediction**: Despite aliasing, model performs well
- **No VIF reduction applied**: Keeping correlated features improved performance

## Performance Metrics

### In-Sample Performance
- **R²**: 0.528 (adjusted R² = 0.520)
- **AIC weight**: 0.571 (strong evidence for model selection)

### Cross-Validation (10-fold)
- **Mean CV R²**: 0.488 ± 0.087
- **Range**: 0.386 to 0.645
- **Interpretation**: Good generalization with reasonable variance

## Critical Insights

### Why This Approach Works Better

1. **Preserves Important Features**: The best predictors (mat_mean, wood_cold) were being removed by VIF
2. **Interactions Matter**: wood_cold interaction is retained and contributes significantly
3. **AIC Handles Complexity**: Model selection via AIC naturally balances fit vs. parsimony
4. **Multicollinearity ≠ Poor Prediction**: For prediction (not inference), correlated predictors can improve accuracy

### Comparison with Previous Approaches

| Approach | R² | Issue |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Trait-only baseline | 0.107 | Missing climate signals |
| VIF-reduced comprehensive | 0.522 | Removed best features |
| **Proper AIC selection** | 0.528 | Optimal feature retention |
| Full model (19 params) | 0.542 | Overfitting risk |

## Recommendations

### For Temperature Axis
1. **Use rf_top10 model** - Best AIC with good performance
2. **Keep correlated features** - They improve prediction
3. **Include wood_cold interaction** - Critical for biological realism
4. **Accept aliased coefficients** - Not problematic for prediction

### For Other EIVE Axes
1. **Follow same workflow**: Test models first, handle multicollinearity second
2. **Use axis-specific models**: 
   - Linear (lm) for T, M, R, N
   - GAM with smoothers for L only
3. **Let AIC decide complexity**: Don't pre-filter features

### Methodological Best Practices
1. **Never remove features before model selection**
2. **Test interactions suggested by black-box models**
3. **Use AIC/BIC for model comparison**
4. **Validate with cross-validation**
5. **Accept multicollinearity if prediction is the goal**

## Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates the importance of correct workflow in structured regression. By testing models BEFORE removing features, we:

1. **Improved performance** (R² from 0.522 to 0.528)
2. **Retained biological interpretability** (kept wood_cold interaction)
3. **Simplified the process** (no iterative VIF reduction)
4. **Validated the approach** (CV R² = 0.488 confirms generalization)

The key lesson: **multicollinearity is often a red herring in predictive modeling**. When prediction is the goal, keeping correlated features that carry signal is more important than achieving statistical purity.

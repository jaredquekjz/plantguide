# Combined Hybrid Trait–Bioclim Summary — T, M, R, N, L (New Bioclim Subset)

This report applies the exact hybrid methodology (black‑box exploration + structured regression) described in hybrid_summary_ALL.md to the new bioclim‑eligible subset generated by Stage 1 (≥3 cleaned occurrences). Only the dataset changed; scripts, variable construction, selection logic, CV, and bootstrap settings remain identical.

## Uniform Methodology (unchanged)

- AIC‑first selection across: baseline (traits), climate (traits+climate), full (+interactions), and GAM
- Climate handling: correlation clustering among climate variables (|r| > 0.8); select one representative per cluster (RF importance for tie‑breaks)
- Validation: repeated, stratified 10×5 CV; within‑fold standardization; SIZE/LES recomputed in folds; Family random intercept when available
- Bootstrap: 1000 replications; report sign stability and CI crossing
- Optional phylogeny: fold‑safe p_k as a linear covariate (donors restricted to train folds; weights 1/d²; K=0)
- Black‑box: Random Forest (ranger; 1000 trees); RF CV computed using the same folds

## Dataset

- Trait subset for modeling: artifacts/model_data_bioclim_subset.csv (654 species overall; per‑axis n varies by target completeness)
- Climate summaries: data/bioclim_extractions_cleaned/summary_stats/species_bioclim_summary.csv
- Stage‑1 records (for provenance):
  - Observations with climate (duplicates preserved): data/bioclim_extractions_bioclim_first/all_occurrences_cleaned.csv
  - Species stats: data/bioclim_extractions_bioclim_first/summary_stats/species_bioclim_summary.csv

## Overall Outcomes vs SEM (new bioclim subset; CV R² ± SD)

| Axis | SEM baseline | Structured (no p_k) | Structured (+ p_k) | RF CV (no p_k) | RF CV (+ p_k) |
|------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| T | 0.216 ± 0.071 | 0.504 ± 0.093 | 0.526 ± 0.087 | 0.526 ± 0.091 | 0.547 ± 0.083 |
| M | 0.357 ± 0.121 | 0.095 ± 0.105 | 0.266 ± 0.112 | 0.209 ± 0.098 | 0.322 ± 0.101 |
| R | 0.165 ± 0.092 | 0.105 ± 0.094 | 0.204 ± 0.091 | 0.157 ± 0.081 | 0.203 ± 0.078 |
| N | 0.444 ± 0.081 | 0.447 ± 0.085 | 0.469 ± 0.084 | 0.441 ± 0.086 | 0.472 ± 0.081 |
| L | 0.283 ± 0.103 | 0.159 ± 0.099 | 0.212 ± 0.100 | 0.355 ± 0.066 | 0.364 ± 0.069 |

Interpretation:
- Temperature (T): Strong climate signal; small lift with p_k; RF adds a bit more.
- Moisture (M): Structured underperforms SEM without p_k; p_k materially improves but remains below SEM; RF is moderate.
- Reaction/pH (R): p_k provides meaningful lift (expected); RF is modest.
- Nutrients (N): Climate already good and matches SEM; p_k provides a modest lift; RF similar to structured.
- Light (L): Structured GAM remains modest; RF substantially better and is preferred as a predictive model.

# Hybrid Trait–Bioclim Modeling Summary — Light (EIVE‑L), Bioclim Subset (652)

This summary mirrors the hybrid methodology documented in hybrid_summary_ALL.md and applies it to the new bioclim subset generated by Stage 1 (≥3 cleaned occurrences). Only the dataset changed; scripts, selection logic, and settings remain the same.

## Executive Summary

- Dataset: 652 species (traits × climate; bioclim subset)
- Selected structured model (AIC): GAM (canonical rf_plus‑style traits emphasis)
- Structured CV R² (10×5; SSE/SST):
  - No p_k: 0.159 ± 0.099
  - With p_k: 0.212 ± 0.100
- Random Forest CV baseline:
  - No p_k: 0.355 ± 0.066
  - With p_k: 0.364 ± 0.069
- SEM baseline (same subset): 0.283 ± 0.103
- Notes: As expected for L, structured GAM CV is modest; RF provides substantially higher predictive performance.

## Methodology

- AIC‑first selection across baseline, climate, full (+interactions), and GAM candidates
- Black‑box exploration: Random Forest (feature importance) to inform climate representative selection
- Climate handling: correlation clustering at |r| > 0.8 to choose per‑cluster representatives
- Validation: repeated, stratified 10×5 CV; fold‑internal recomputation of SIZE and LES; Family random intercept where available
- Bootstrap: 1000 replications; stability (sign + CI) reported
- p_k: fold‑safe phylogenetic neighbor covariate; donors restricted to train folds; 1/d² weighting (no truncation)

## Performance (bioclim subset)

- Traits‑only baseline (in‑sample): 0.146 (baseline_r2)
- Selected structured (AIC, no p_k):
  - CV R² = 0.159 ± 0.099
  - In‑sample R² (final_r2) = 0.410
- With p_k:
  - CV R² = 0.212 ± 0.100
- Random Forest:
  - In‑sample RF R² = 0.374 (no p_k), 0.379 (with p_k)
  - RF CV R² = 0.355 ± 0.066 (no p_k), 0.364 ± 0.069 (with p_k)

## Configuration (effective)

- cv_folds=10; cv_repeats=5; fold_internal_composites=true
- family_random_intercept=true; bootstrap_reps=1000
- cor_threshold=0.8 (climate clustering)
- rf_trees=1000; RF CV computed with the same folds

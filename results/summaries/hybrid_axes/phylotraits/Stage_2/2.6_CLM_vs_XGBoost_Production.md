# Stage 2.6: CLM vs XGBoost Comparison

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Complete - Shipley et al. (2017) full replication vs production XGBoost models

## Summary

This document compares two modeling approaches for predicting European plant ecological indicator values (EIVE):

1. **CLM Baseline (Shipley et al. 2017)**: Cumulative link model with plant functional type × trait interactions (traits only)
2. **XGBoost Production Models**: Gradient boosting with traits, phylogenetic predictors, and environmental quantiles

The comparison validates the substantial performance improvement achieved by incorporating environmental context and phylogenetic information beyond traits alone.

## Model Specifications

### CLM Baseline (Shipley et al. 2017 Replication)

**Formula** (Table 2 "Simplified Model without Interactions"):
```
EIVEres-{L,M,N} ~ plant_form * (logLA + logLDMC + logSLA + logSM)
```

This allows plant functional type to interact with all traits, giving different trait slopes for each plant type.

**Features**:
- Plant functional form (3 categories: graminoid, herb, tree)
  - Note: Shrubs (n=3) merged with trees due to insufficient sample size
- 4 log-transformed traits (leaf area, LDMC, SLA, seed mass)
- Plant_form × trait interactions (different slopes per plant type)

**Total predictors**: ~17 parameters (3 plant types × 4 traits + 3 plant intercepts + 8 ordinal thresholds)

**Method**: VGAM::vglm with cumulative logit link, parallel slopes
**Package**: VGAM (ordinal::clm encountered numerical instability in our implementation)

### XGBoost Hybrid (Full Feature Set)

**Features** (741 total):
- Same 4 canonical traits (log-transformed)
- 7 TRY categorical traits (woodiness, growth form, habitat, etc.)
- 92 phylogenetic eigenvectors
- 5 phylogenetic predictors (p_phylo_{L,T,M,N,R}) - context-dependent neighbor EIVE values
- 4 cross-axis EIVE predictors (other axes as features)
- 633 environmental quantiles (WorldClim, soil properties, climate extremes)

**Method**: XGBoost with grid-searched hyperparameters (learning_rate, n_estimators)

## Performance Comparison

### Complete Metrics: CLM vs XGBoost Production Models

**CLM Baseline** uses 1,084 Tier 1 species (10-fold CV).
**XGBoost Full** uses ~6,200 Tier 2 species with cross-axis EIVE features (10-fold CV).
**XGBoost No-EIVE** uses ~6,200 Tier 2 species WITHOUT EIVE features - production model for imputation (10-fold CV).

| Model | Axis | Dataset | R² | MAE | Acc±1 |
|-------|------|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| XGBoost Full | T | 6,220 Tier 2 | 0.823 ± 0.016 | 0.522 | 94.2% |

| XGBoost No-EIVE | R | 6,063 Tier 2 | 0.441 ± 0.030 | 0.883 | 81.3% |

### Performance Summary

**Average improvement (CLM → XGBoost No-EIVE, L/M/N only):**
- R²: 0.213 → 0.620 (+191% relative improvement)
- MAE: 1.137 → 0.777 (-32% error reduction)
- Acc±1: 53.1% → 85.7% (+32.6 percentage points)

**XGBoost No-EIVE vs Full models:**
- Average R² drop: -0.057 (-8.8%)
- No-EIVE models used for imputing 5,756 species without observed EIVE

## Key Findings

### 1. XGBoost Substantially Outperforms Trait-Only CLM

Even XGBoost No-EIVE models (without cross-axis EIVE features) achieve 1.4-6× higher R² than CLM across all axes:
- L-axis: 0.611 vs 0.233 (162% improvement)
- M-axis: 0.649 vs 0.110 (490% improvement)
- N-axis: 0.601 vs 0.298 (102% improvement)

MAE reduced by 27-38%, Acc±1 improved by 29-36 percentage points.

### 2. CLM Baseline Weak for M-Axis

The CLM model barely explains moisture variation (R² = 0.110), with high uncertainty (±0.088). This indicates:
- Traits alone insufficient for predicting moisture tolerance
- Environmental context critical (soil moisture, precipitation)

XGBoost No-EIVE achieves R² = 0.649 for M-axis (490% improvement), primarily through environmental quantiles.

### 3. Trait-Only Models Miss Critical Signals

CLM uses only plant traits and plant functional type, ignoring:
- **Environmental adaptation**: Species distributions reflect climate/soil niches
- **Phylogenetic conservatism**: Related species share ecological strategies
- **Cross-axis dependencies**: EIVE values correlated (captured by Full models only)

XGBoost captures environmental and phylogenetic signals through:
- 633 environmental quantiles (climate, soil, topography)
- 92 phylogenetic eigenvectors
- 5 phylogenetic predictors p_phylo_* (Full models)
- 4 cross-axis EIVE predictors (Full models)

### 4. No-EIVE Models Suitable for Production Imputation

XGBoost No-EIVE models (without EIVE-related features):
- Average R² 0.622 vs 0.678 for Full models (-8.8% drop)
- Still vastly superior to CLM baseline (191% improvement)
- Used for imputing 5,756 species without observed EIVE (see Stage 2.7)
- Avoid feature availability issues for species without EIVE neighbors

### 5. Phylogenetic Predictors Remain Critical

In Full model SHAP rankings (Stage 2.1-2.5):
- p_phylo_M: Rank #1 for M-axis
- p_phylo_L: Rank #3 for L-axis
- p_phylo_N: Rank #2 for N-axis

These predictors encode phylogenetic niche conservatism. No-EIVE models rely on phylogenetic eigenvectors (non-EIVE) instead, maintaining phylogenetic signal through evolutionary structure.

## Methodological Notes

### Shipley et al. (2017) Replication

**Formula**: We replicated Shipley's Table 2 "Simplified Model without Interactions":
```r
axis_y ~ plant_form * (logLA + logLDMC + logSLA + logSM)
```

This model allows trait effects to vary by plant type (graminoid/herb/tree).

**Data adjustment**: Shrubs (n=3) merged with trees due to insufficient sample size for estimating separate interaction terms. This is necessary because the model estimates 4 trait slopes for each plant type, requiring sufficient observations per category.

**Original Shipley sample**:
- Nutrients: 922 species
- Moisture: 988 species
- Light: 981 species

**Our sample**: 1,082-1,084 species (comparable or larger)

**Package choice**: VGAM::vglm used instead of ordinal::clm due to numerical stability. The ordinal package encountered prediction failures during cross-validation in our tests.

### Why XGBoost Works

1. **Environmental features**: 633 climate/soil quantiles encode habitat preferences
   - M-axis improvement from 0.11 → 0.68 primarily attributable to soil moisture variables
2. **Phylogenetic predictors**: p_phylo features capture niche conservatism (top 3 features)
3. **Nonlinear interactions**: Tree-based splits capture complex trait-environment couplings
4. **Automatic feature selection**: Irrelevant features ignored through tree splitting
5. **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting despite 741 features

### EIVE Weighting

CLM and XGBoost both use uniform weights (all species contribute equally to training). EIVE observation weights (L.n, M.n, N.n) were not available in the input data.

## Reproduction

## Conclusions

### Main Findings

1. **XGBoost vastly superior to trait-only CLM**: Even without cross-axis EIVE features, XGBoost No-EIVE achieves 1.4-6× higher R² (102-490% improvement) and 29-36 percentage points higher Acc±1 compared to Shipley et al. (2017) CLM baseline

2. **Traits alone insufficient**: CLM with plant functional type × trait interactions achieves only R² 0.11-0.30. Environmental context and phylogenetic structure essential for predictive performance

3. **M-axis particularly weak for trait-only models**: CLM R² = 0.110 (barely above baseline), while XGBoost No-EIVE achieves 0.649 (490% improvement), driven by environmental quantiles (soil moisture, precipitation)

4. **No-EIVE models suitable for production**: XGBoost No-EIVE models perform 191% better than CLM on average, with only 8.8% R² drop compared to Full models. Used for imputing 5,756 species without observed EIVE (Stage 2.7)

5. **Cross-axis EIVE adds moderate value**: Full models with cross-axis EIVE features gain 5-9% R² over No-EIVE models (0.678 vs 0.622 average). Primary predictive power comes from environmental quantiles and phylogenetic structure, not cross-axis dependencies

### Scientific Implications

The substantial performance gap demonstrates that ecological indicator values emerge from complex interactions between:
- **Plant traits**: Morphological and chemical characteristics (R² ~0.21 with CLM)
- **Environmental niches**: Climate and soil adaptations (+40% R² with XGBoost)
- **Phylogenetic history**: Evolutionary conservatism in ecological strategies (via eigenvectors and p_phylo predictors)

Gradient boosting captures these nonlinear relationships through automatic feature selection and tree-based splits. Linear ordinal models (CLM) cannot learn environmental-trait or phylogeny-trait interactions, limiting predictive power.

**Recommendation**: Trait-based EIVE prediction requires environmental context (climate/soil quantiles) and phylogenetic information (eigenvectors or p_phylo predictors). Traits alone, regardless of interaction complexity, provide insufficient predictive power for production use.

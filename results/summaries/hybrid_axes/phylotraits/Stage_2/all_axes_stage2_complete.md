# Stage 2 Structured Regression Analysis - Complete Results
Date: 2025-09-19 (Updated with Climate Enhancement Test)

## Overview
Comprehensive comparison of structured regression approaches for predicting European plant ecological indicator values (EIVE) across all five axes. All methods properly incorporate bioclim features during cross-validation.

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Fixed implementation bugs that prevented phylogenetic predictors from being included in full models. Previous results showing 0.000 improvement were incorrect.

# Canonical Stage 2 workflows
*GAMs (with trait PCs) are now the default Stage‑2 models; pwSEM rows are kept only for historical reference.*

1. **GAM (canonical)**: trait PCs + key climate drivers + targeted smooth/tensor terms
2. **pwSEM (legacy)**: piecewise SEM with bioclim features (optional, interpretability only)

## Key Findings (UPDATED WITH FIXES)

### 1. Method Performance (current canon)
- **T axis**: PC+tensor GAM reaches 0.552 ± 0.109 (closes ~22% of the gap to XGBoost); phylogeny remains significant.
- **L axis**: PC+tensor GAM reaches 0.340 ± 0.083 (about two-thirds of the gap closed); pwSEM retained only for structural context.
- **M axis**: The pwSEM-aligned GAM (0.393 ± 0.105) now sits within ~0.006 R² of pwSEM+phylo, providing an additive canonical option.
- **N/R axes**: pwSEM+phylo combinations still deliver the best balance.

### 2. Feature Importance Patterns (from AIC analysis)
- **Temperature**: bio15_mean (precip seasonality) dominant (0.93 combined importance)
- **Moisture**: p_phylo_M highest (1.00), followed by plant height (0.37)
- **Light**: EIVEres-M cross-axis dependency (0.65), woody growth form (0.60)
- **Nutrients**: log_ldmc_minus_log_la dominant (0.93), height (0.92)
- **Reaction/pH**: p_phylo_R (0.80) and EIVEres-N cross-dependency (0.78)

### 3. Model Selection by AIC
- **Climate-only preferred**: M (97%), N (99%)
- **Mixed selection**: T (78% climate, 20% GAM)
- **Full model preferred**: L (100%), R (83%)

### 4. Interpretability vs Performance Trade-off (UPDATED)
- Stage 2 models now achieve 87-109% of XGBoost pk performance
- **M axis: pwSEM+phylo EXCEEDS XGBoost** (0.399 vs 0.366) and the new GAM trails by only ~0.006 R² (0.393 vs 0.366)
- **R axis: Nearly matches XGBoost** (0.222 vs 0.225, 95% performance)
- **N axis: Strong performance** (0.472 vs 0.487, 97% of XGBoost)
- **Trade-off eliminated for some axes**, minimal for others

## Technical Notes

### Critical Bug Fixes Applied (2025-09-18)
1. **Phylo not computed for full model**: Added computation at line 894-954 of run_sem_pwsem.R
2. **L axis bypassed phylo**: Fixed specialized GAM formulas at lines 543-544, 585-586
3. **L axis missing features**: Added EIVEres-M, is_woody, les_seasonality
4. **Column name handling**: Fixed EIVEres-X vs EIVEres.X naming issues
5. **Previous fixes retained**: Bioclim features in CV, fold-safe phylo computation

### Computational Details
- Cross-validation: 10 repeats × 10 folds = 100 models per method
- Parallel execution: 15 simultaneous jobs via tmux
- Runtime: ~45 minutes for all 15 analyses
- Data: 260 complete cases after missing data handling

## Reproducibility

```bash
# Run all Stage 2 analyses in parallel
make -f Makefile.stage2_structured_regression tmux_parallel_all

# Run specific axis
make -f Makefile.stage2_structured_regression pwsem_T
make -f Makefile.stage2_structured_regression pwsem_phylo_T
make -f Makefile.stage2_structured_regression aic_T

# Monitor progress
tmux attach -t stage2_parallel
```

## Conclusions (CORRECTED)

1. **Phylogenetic predictor WORKS when properly implemented**: Significant improvements for M, N, R axes
2. **pwSEM+phylo matches or exceeds XGBoost** for multiple axes (M exceeds, R/N nearly match)
3. **Implementation quality critical**: Initial 0.000 results were bugs, not lack of signal
4. **Axis-specific responses**: R shows strongest phylo signal (+0.056), T shows none (redundant with climate)
5. **L axis needs feature engineering**: Enhanced model with missing predictors improves substantially

## Impact of Fixes

| Issue | Before Fix | After Fix | Impact |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| M axis phylo | R²=0.359 | R²=0.399 | **+11% improvement** |
| N axis phylo | R²=0.444 | R²=0.472 | **+6% improvement** |
| R axis phylo | R²=0.166 | R²=0.222 | **+34% improvement** |
| L axis enhanced | R²=0.285 | R²=0.324 | **+14% improvement** |

## Climate Enhancement Test (2025-09-19)

### T Axis with Complete Climate Features
**Objective**: Test if adding all missing climate features closes the 0.047 performance gap

**Features Added**:
- All temperature extremes: mat_q05, mat_q95, tmax_mean, mat_sd
- Missing climate: precip_coldest_q, ai_month_min
- Critical interactions: lma_precip, height_temp, size_temp, size_precip
- 100% coverage of XGBoost SHAP top features

**Result**: **Minimal improvement** (R² = 0.5462 ± 0.0848)
- Only +0.003 improvement after fixing `deconstruct_size=FALSE` bug
- 654 species, 81 features total (29 climate/interaction)
- Model successfully used all 18 climate features via GAM smoothers
- Bug fix critical: Initially showed zero improvement due to wrong code path

**Key Finding**: Feature completeness provides marginal gains (+0.003) - GAM/pwSEM structure cannot exploit features as effectively as XGBoost. The 0.044 gap is due to model flexibility and inability to capture complex interactions, not missing features.

**Reproduction**:
```bash
# Prepare enhanced data (654 species with climate)
make prepare_climate_data

# Run enhanced T axis (requires --deconstruct_size true)
make stage2_T_enhanced
```

## Next Steps
- Test explicit interaction terms (SIZE:mat_mean, LES:temp_seasonality)
- Increase GAM flexibility (higher k values, tensor products)
- Consider boosted GAMs or alternative flexible structures
- Apply validated models to full dataset for production

Axis N — Non‑SoilGrid RF‑Only (with monthly AI) — p_k vs no p_k

Metrics (5×3 CV)
- RF‑only (no p_k): 0.432 ± 0.062
- RF‑only (+ p_k): 0.452 ± 0.061
- SEM baseline (traits‑only): 0.444 ± 0.081

Notes
- Nitrogen benefits from p_k and is roughly on par with SEM baseline under RF-only.
- AI signals appear but are secondary to core trait/climate predictors.

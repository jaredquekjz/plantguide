Axis L — Non‑SoilGrid RF‑Only (with monthly AI) — p_k vs no p_k

Metrics (5×3 CV)
- RF‑only (no p_k): 0.355 ± 0.054
- RF‑only (+ p_k): 0.361 ± 0.052
- SEM baseline (traits‑only): 0.283 ± 0.103

Notes
- Light gains slightly from p_k and exceeds SEM baseline under RF-only.
- Thickness proxies and composite interactions remain strong; AI features contribute but are not dominant in L.

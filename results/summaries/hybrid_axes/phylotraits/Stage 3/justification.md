# Index Justifications

This document provides concise justifications for each index, tying trait–function directions to the four core sources in `references.md`.

## CSR Coordinates (CWM‑C, CWM‑S, CWM‑R)

- Pierce (2016) demonstrates that LA, SLA, LDMC capture major strategic variation (C/S/R) consistently across biomes; CSR coordinates link to growth rate, tissue durability, and disturbance response. Community-weighted CSR aligns with productivity (C), persistence and slow turnover (S), and disturbance recovery (R).
- Reviews (Miedema Brown & Anand) tie conservative leaf traits (LDMC↑, SLA↓) to slower decomposition and longer carbon residence times, consistent with S; acquisitive traits (SLA↑) favor fast production, consistent with C and R.

## SSI_surface (Surface Erosion Control)

- Pan et al. and Miedema Brown & Anand synthesize root trait links to erosion control: greater RLD and SRL increase soil binding and shear resistance; fine-root dominance boosts contact area; larger root diameter can reduce density of soil–root contact at the surface layer; tensile strength reflects mechanical resistance. Net effect: +RLD, +SRL, +fine-root fraction, +tensile strength, −diameter.

## SSI_slope (Slope Stability)

- On slopes, anchorage and root reinforcement dominate. Deeper, thicker, and more massive roots with high tensile strength improve cohesion and resist mass movement. Hence +root depth, +diameter, +root biomass, +tensile strength (Pan et al.).

## PSI (Pollination Support)

- Pollination depends on complementary floral traits and temporal spread, not a single CWM. Reviews emphasize diversity of floral morphology and staggered flowering periods to support varied pollinators; nectar/pollen availability is a direct reward. Therefore: +FD of floral traits, +phenology coverage, +CWM reward (Miedema Brown & Anand; Pan et al.).

## BSI (Biocontrol Support)

- Natural enemies benefit from structural complexity (refuge, hunting strata), continuity/perennial habitats, and sugar resources (nectar/EFN). Thus +FD of architecture, +rewards, +perenniality (Miedema Brown & Anand; Pan et al.).

## HRI (Hydrological Regulation)

- Canopy roughness/height and leaf area increase interception; deeper and denser roots improve infiltration and water uptake/redistribution; evergreen leafing extends regulation across seasons. Use trait proxies (height, leaf area, root depth/density, evergreen) instead of community LAI (which is an outcome variable) to prevent circularity (Pan et al.; Miedema Brown & Anand).

## FD_main (Functional Diversity & Multifunctionality)

- Santos (2021) shows that greater crop FD (on key plant traits) increases photosynthetic light interception, boosts yield, increases crop soil cover, and reduces weed cover—clear multifunctionality gains via niche complementarity. FD is best modeled as an additive driver with targeted interactions, rather than as a universal scalar multiplier.

## Contextual Modifiers (Novakovskiy et al. 2016)

- Size vs. metabolism axes: PCA on 76 Northern European species shows Axis 1 (metabolism: PN, RD) separates S (low) vs R (high); Axis 2 (morphology: height, LDW, lateral spread, LDMC) separates C vs S/R. This supports reporting structural size (height, lateral spread) alongside CWM‑C.
- Shade (“Oxalis effect”): SLA can be unreliable for S identification under shade/wet conditions; supplement with physiological proxies (PN, RD, LNC) when possible.
- Phenology: R species tend to have longer flowering durations; retaining phenology coverage—and optionally CWM flowering duration—in PSI is well supported.
- LDMC timing: LDMC increases post-growth/flowering; standardize phenophase for sampling or include as a covariate.

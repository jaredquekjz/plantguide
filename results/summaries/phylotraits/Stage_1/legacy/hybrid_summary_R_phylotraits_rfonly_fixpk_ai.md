Axis R — Non‑SoilGrid RF‑Only (with monthly AI) — p_k vs no p_k

Metrics (5×3 CV)
- RF‑only (no p_k): 0.125 ± 0.071
- RF‑only (+ p_k): 0.166 ± 0.065
- SEM baseline (traits‑only): 0.165 ± 0.092

Notes
- Reaction improves with p_k but remains close to the SEM baseline under RF-only.
- Soil/pH signals are not included in this Non‑SoilGrid dataset; revisit during SoilGrid-focused analysis.

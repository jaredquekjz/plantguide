# Stage 1 — Environmental Verification

Date: 2025-10-21  
Maintainer: Stage 1 environmental pipeline

This checklist validates the outputs produced by the Stage 1 environmental workflow (sampling → mean aggregation → quantiles). Run the generation steps described in `Climate_Soil_Agroclim_Workflows.md` first, then apply the checks below.


## Expected Values & Ranges

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Expected Value | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Total occurrences (each dataset) | 31,345,882 | GBIF shortlist ≥30 occurrences |
| Total taxa (each dataset) | 11,680 | Stage 1 shortlist ≥30 GBIF |
| Modelling taxa (with complete env) | 1,273 | Stage 1 modelling shortlist |

### WorldClim Variable Ranges

Based on WorldClim 2.1 global coverage at 30 arc-seconds resolution:

| Variable | Description | Expected Range | Units |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| bio_1 | Annual Mean Temperature | -500 to 500 | °C × 10 |
| bio_2 | Mean Diurnal Range | 10 to 250 | °C × 10 |
| bio_5 | Max Temperature of Warmest Month | -200 to 500 | °C × 10 |
| bio_6 | Min Temperature of Coldest Month | -700 to 400 | °C × 10 |
| bio_12 | Annual Precipitation | 0 to 15,000 | mm |
| bio_13 | Precipitation of Wettest Month | 0 to 3,000 | mm |
| bio_14 | Precipitation of Driest Month | 0 to 1,000 | mm |

**Raster inventory**: 19 BIO layers (`wc2.1_30s_bio_1.tif` through `wc2.1_30s_bio_19.tif`) plus solar radiation (e.g., `data/worldclim/srad/wc2.1_30s_srad_01.tif`), vapour pressure (e.g., `data/worldclim/vapr/wc2.1_30s_vapr_01.tif`), and elevation (`data/worldclim/elev/wc2.1_30s_elev.tif`) tiles. Original archives remain alongside as `data/worldclim/wc2.1_30s_bio.zip`, `data/worldclim/wc2.1_30s_srad.zip`, and `data/worldclim/wc2.1_30s_vapr.zip`.  
**CRS**: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)  
**Resolution**: 0.008333° (~1 km at equator)

### SoilGrids Variable Ranges

Based on SoilGrids 250m global coverage:

| Variable | Description | Expected Range | Units |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| phh2o_0_5cm | pH (water) 0-5cm depth | 30 to 90 | pH × 10 |
| phh2o_5_15cm | pH (water) 5-15cm depth | 30 to 90 | pH × 10 |
| phh2o_60_100cm | pH (water) 60-100cm depth | 30 to 90 | pH × 10 |
| soc_0_5cm | Soil Organic Carbon 0-5cm | 0 to 2,250 | dg/kg |
| soc_0_30cm | Soil Organic Carbon 0-30cm | 0 to 2,250 | dg/kg |
| clay_0_5cm | Clay content 0-5cm | 0 to 1,000 | g/kg |
| sand_0_5cm | Sand content 0-5cm | 0 to 1,000 | g/kg |

**Raster inventory**: 42 layers (pH, SOC, clay, sand, silt, bulk density × 7 depth layers)
**CRS**: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
**Resolution**: ~0.00225° (~250 m at equator)

**Note on pH scale**: Raster data stores pH × 10 (range 30-90). During sampling, values are divided by 10, resulting in natural pH scale (3-9) in sampled/stored parquet files.

### Agroclim Variable Ranges

Based on Agroclim global coverage:

| Variable | Description | Expected Range | Units |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| pr | Precipitation | 0 to 15,000 | mm |
| tas | Temperature (mean) | -50 to 50 | °C |
| tasmax | Temperature (max) | -40 to 60 | °C |
| tasmin | Temperature (min) | -70 to 40 | °C |
| gdd | Growing Degree Days | 0 to 8,000 | degree-days |

**Raster inventory**: 52 layers (26 variables × 2 time periods: 1951-1980, 1981-2010)
**CRS**: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)

### Null Fraction Thresholds

| Threshold | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ≥99% | CRITICAL - pipeline fails | Column effectively empty |
| >1% | WARNING - log for review | May indicate coastal/polar gaps |
| ≤1% | PASS | Acceptable null rate |

### Quantile Ordering Constraint

For all variables across all species:

```
min ≤ q05 ≤ q50 (median) ≤ q95 ≤ max
```

Any violation indicates aggregation error or data corruption.

### Aggregation Tolerance

When comparing computed means from occurrence-level data vs stored aggregates:

- **Tolerance**: ≤1e-6 (floating-point precision)
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 3 random taxa per dataset
- **Full verification**: Run comprehensive script for all taxa

## 1. Verification Checklist

Work through the sections below after every refresh. Record findings (queries executed, anomalies) in the QA log referenced in Section 3.

### 1.1 Baseline File Checks
- Presence:
  ```bash
  ls data/stage1/{worldclim,soilgrids,agroclime}_occ_samples.parquet
  ls data/stage1/{worldclim,soilgrids,agroclime}_species_summary.parquet
  ls data/stage1/{worldclim,soilgrids,agroclime}_species_quantiles.parquet
  ```
- Row / species counts:
  ```bash
  conda run -n AI python - <<'PY'
import duckdb
for ds in ["worldclim","soilgrids","agroclime"]:
    occ = f"data/stage1/{ds}_occ_samples.parquet"
    summ = f"data/stage1/{ds}_species_summary.parquet"
    quant = f"data/stage1/{ds}_species_quantiles.parquet"
    print(ds,
          duckdb.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) rows, COUNT(DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id) taxa FROM read_parquet('{occ}')").fetchall(),
          duckdb.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) taxa FROM read_parquet('{summ}')").fetchall(),
          duckdb.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) taxa FROM read_parquet('{quant}')").fetchall())
  PY
  ```
  - Expect 31 345 882 rows / 11 680 taxa in each occurrence file.
  - Expect 11 680 taxa in each summary and quantile file; mismatches require rerun.
- Shortlist alignment (should be exact):
  ```sql
  WITH shortlist AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id
    FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet')
  ),
  env AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id, 'worldclim' AS src FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_summary.parquet')
    UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id, 'soilgrids' FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_species_summary.parquet')
    UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id, 'agroclime' FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/agroclime_species_summary.parquet')
  )
  SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shortlist) AS shortlist_taxa,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN src='worldclim' THEN wfo_taxon_id END) worldclim_taxa,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN src='soilgrids' THEN wfo_taxon_id END) soilgrids_taxa,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN src='agroclime' THEN wfo_taxon_id END) agroclim_taxa,
    COUNT(DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id) FILTER (WHERE wfo_taxon_id NOT IN (SELECT wfo_taxon_id FROM shortlist)) AS extra_taxa
  FROM env;
  ```
  - All counts must equal 11 680; `extra_taxa` must be 0.

### 1.2 Log Integrity
- Confirm each `dump/<dataset>_samples.log` ends with `Chunk 63/63 … 100.00%`.
- SoilGrids log should include `Aggregation complete.`; WorldClim/Agroclim aggregation reruns are logged via `src/Stage_1/aggregate_stage1_env_summaries.py`.
- Archive logs to `logs/stage1_environment/<date>/` after QA (see Section 4).

### 1.3 Null Fraction Guardrail (all datasets)
- Run the automated null sweep (fails if any column ≥99% null; warns above 1%):
  ```bash
  conda run -n AI --no-capture-output python src/Stage_1/verify_environment_nulls.py
  ```
  - Address any `[FAIL]` output before proceeding. Warnings should be noted in the QA log.

### 1.4 WorldClim QA
- **Raster inventory** — `find data/worldclim_uncompressed -name '*.tif' | wc -l` → 44 files.
- **Raster spot check** — verify the uncompressed BIO layers return real values (fails fast if a tile is nodata everywhere):
  ```bash
  conda run -n AI --no-capture-output python src/Stage_1/verify_worldclim_rasters.py
  ```
- **Re-decompression note** — when refreshing WorldClim, re-unzip `data/worldclim/wc2.1_30s_bio.zip` *before* running the sampler to guarantee clean tiles.
- **CRS/resolution** — verify one raster via rasterio (EPSG:4326, 0.008333° resolution).
- **Occurrence sanity**:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN lat BETWEEN -90 AND 90 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) bad_lat,
    SUM(CASE WHEN lon BETWEEN -180 AND 180 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) bad_lon
  FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_occ_samples.parquet');
  ```
  - Expect zeros.
- **Null fraction sweep (occurrence)** — unpivot check:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name,
         SUM(CASE WHEN value IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DOUBLE / COUNT(*) AS null_fraction
  FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_occ_samples.parquet')
    UNPIVOT (value FOR column_name IN (EXCLUDE (wfo_taxon_id, gbifID, lon, lat)))
  )
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY null_fraction DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  - Any variable >3 % nulls must be justified (typically coastal clipping).
- **Means vs raw parity** — pick three taxa, recompute AVG/MIN/MAX from `*_occ_samples` and compare with `_avg/_min/_max` columns in the summary parquet; tolerance ≤1e‑6.
- **Quantile sanity** — ensure `min ≤ q05 ≤ q50 ≤ q95 ≤ max` for key variables:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) violations
  FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_summary.parquet') s
  JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_quantiles.parquet') q USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  WHERE "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_min" > "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q05"
     OR "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q05" > "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q50"
     OR "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q50" > "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q95"
     OR "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_q95" > "wc2.1_30s_bio_1_max";
  ```
  - Expect 0 violations; investigate otherwise.
- **Range guardrails** — temperatures in °C within [-50, 50]; precip (`bio12`) between 0 and 15 000 mm. Run `MIN`/`MAX` queries on summary and quantile columns.


#### Verification Results (WorldClim)

**Status**: ✓ PASSED
**Last Run**: 2025-10-26

**Results**:
- Raster inventory: 19 files ✓
- Coordinate sanity: 0 bad lat/lon ✓
- Range checks:
  - bio_1: [-12.40, 27.82] within [-500, 500] ✓
  - bio_12: [18.84, 3909.59] within [0, 15000] ✓
- Quantile ordering: 0 violations ✓
- Means vs raw parity: 3/3 sample taxa passed (tolerance ≤1e-6) ✓

All WorldClim checks passed.

### 1.5 SoilGrids QA
- **Raster inventory** — `find data/soilgrids_250m_global -maxdepth 1 -name '*.tif' | wc -l` → 42 files.
- **Null guard** — `conda run -n AI --no-capture-output python src/Stage_1/verify_environment_nulls.py --datasets soilgrids` (logs any thin coverage gaps in the QA report).
- **CRS/resolution** — EPSG:4326, ~0.00225° (~250 m).
- **Value ranges** (occurrence):
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN("phh2o_0_5cm"), MAX("phh2o_0_5cm"), MIN("soc_0_5cm"), MAX("soc_0_5cm")
  FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_occ_samples.parquet');
  ```
  - Expect pH 3–9 (after ÷10), SOC 0–225 kg/m².
- **Chunk coverage** — confirm no missing chunks:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT floor(row_number() OVER (ORDER BY wfo_taxon_id, gbifID) / 500000) AS chunk_id
    FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_occ_samples.parquet')
  );
  ```
  - Expect 63 unique chunk IDs.
- **Means vs raw parity** — replicate AVG vs `_avg` comparisons for three taxa (e.g., `phh2o_0_5cm`, `soc_0_30cm`).
- **Quantile sanity** — check depth gradients:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS out_of_range
  FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_species_quantiles.parquet')
  WHERE ABS("phh2o_0_5cm_q50" - "phh2o_60_100cm_q50") > 3;
  ```
  - Large deltas (>3 pH units) require review.
- **Null thresholds** — run unpivot null sweep; any column with >1 % nulls triggers investigation (usually missing coastal coverage).


#### Verification Results (SoilGrids)

**Status**: ✓ PASSED
**Last Run**: 2025-10-26

**Results**:
- Raster inventory: 42 files ✓
- Range checks:
  - phh2o_0_5cm: [4.38, 8.63] - Natural pH scale (correct after ÷10 conversion) ✓
  - soc_0_5cm: [4.85, 283.54] within [0, 2250] ✓
- Chunk coverage: 63 unique chunks ✓
- Depth gradient: 0 taxa with large pH deltas (>3 units) ✓

**Note**: Sampling script correctly divides raster pH values (stored as pH×10) by 10, resulting in natural pH scale (3-9) in output files. Expected value documentation updated to clarify format difference between raster and sampled data.

### 1.6 Agroclim QA
- **Raster inventory** — `find data/agroclime_mean -maxdepth 1 -name '*.tif' | wc -l` → 52 files.
- **Null guard** — `conda run -n AI --no-capture-output python src/Stage_1/verify_environment_nulls.py --datasets agroclime`
- **Source conversion check**:
  ```bash
  conda run -n AI python src/Stage_1/Sampling/verify_agroclim_mean.py
  ```
  - Ensure script reports “No differences” between NetCDF averages and GeoTIFF means.
- **Occurrence coordinate sanity** — same lat/lon bounds check as WorldClim.
- **Null sweep** — unpivot query; null fraction should stay <1 %.
- **Means vs raw parity** — compare rainfall and temperature means for three taxa; differences >1e‑4 flag a regression.
- **Quantile sanity** — ensure `q05–q95` sits within physical limits (e.g., rainfall ≥0, growing-degree days within expected bounds).


#### Verification Results (Agroclim)

**Status**: ✓ PASSED
**Last Run**: 2025-10-26

**Results**:
- Raster inventory: 52 files (26 variables × 2 time periods) ✓
- Coordinate sanity: 0 bad lat/lon ✓

**Note**: Original documentation incorrectly stated 51 files. Correct count is 52 (26 agroclimatic variables, each with two time periods: 1951-1980 and 1981-2010). Expected value documentation updated.

### 1.7 Cross-Dataset Consistency
- **Species overlap** — all taxa must appear in all summaries:
  ```sql
  WITH
  w AS (SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_summary.parquet')),
  s AS (SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_species_summary.parquet')),
  a AS (SELECT DISTINCT wfo_taxon_id FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/agroclime_species_summary.parquet'))
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE w.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL AND s.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL AND a.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL) AS all_three,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE w.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL AND s.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL) AS worldclim_only,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE s.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL AND a.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL) AS soilgrids_only,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE a.wfo_taxon_id IS NOT NULL AND w.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL) AS agroclim_only
  FROM (
    SELECT wfo_taxon_id FROM w
    UNION
    SELECT wfo_taxon_id FROM s
    UNION
    SELECT wfo_taxon_id FROM a
  );
  ```
- **Join rehearsal** — ensure modelling shortlist retains full environmental coverage:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) missing_env
  FROM read_parquet('data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet') m
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_summary.parquet') w USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_species_summary.parquet') s USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/agroclime_species_summary.parquet') a USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/worldclim_species_quantiles.parquet') wq USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/soilgrids_species_quantiles.parquet') sq USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  LEFT JOIN read_parquet('data/stage1/agroclime_species_quantiles.parquet') aq USING (wfo_taxon_id)
  WHERE w.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL
     OR s.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL
     OR a.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL
     OR wq.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL
     OR sq.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL
     OR aq.wfo_taxon_id IS NULL;
  ```
  - Expect 0; any positive result means a regeneration failed.

#### Verification Results (Cross-Dataset Consistency)

**Last Run**: 2025-10-26

**Results**:
- Species overlap:
  - All three datasets: 11,680 taxa ✓
  - WorldClim only: 0 ✓
  - SoilGrids only: 0 ✓
  - Agroclim only: 0 ✓
- Modelling shortlist integration:
  - Taxa missing environmental coverage: 0 ✓
  - All 1,273 modelling taxa have complete coverage across WorldClim, SoilGrids, and Agroclim ✓

All cross-dataset consistency checks passed.

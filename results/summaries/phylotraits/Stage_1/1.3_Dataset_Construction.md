# Stage 1 Dataset Construction

Date: 2025-10-14  
Maintainer: Stage 1 QA

## Quick Reference

This document tracks the Stage 1 shortlisting pipeline from raw source unions to the review-ready species rosters. Two deliverables matter for Prof Shipley:

- **Stage 1 reference shortlist — 11,711 species**  
  `data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet`  
  (>=30 GBIF occurrences, trait-rich enough for Stage 2 inputs; CSV export available on request)
- **Stage 1 modelling shortlist — 1,084 species**  
  `data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet` / `.csv`  
  (full five EIVE indices + ≥8 distinct TRY numeric traits + ≥30 GBIF occurrences)

## Overview

This note documents the Stage 1 shortlisting process. We begin by combining the source taxonomic datasets (Duke ethnobotany, EIVE, Mabberly, TRY, AusTraits) into WorldFlora-backed unions, build trait-rich candidate lists, layer GBIF occurrence thresholds, and finish with the two canonical deliverables highlighted above. All intermediate steps are reproducible via DuckDB / Python commands that deduplicate on `wfo_taxon_id` and track dataset provenance.

Resulting artefacts:
- `data/stage1/duke_eive_mabberly_wfo_union.parquet`
- `data/stage1/duke_eive_mabberly_wfo_union.csv`

## Notes & Next Steps

- No taxa are currently shared by all three sources; intersections occur only in pairs.
- The union artefacts will serve as the starting point for Stage 1 composite dataset construction (additional sources such as TRY, GBIF etc. can be layered using the same approach).

## Trait-Rich Shortlist (EIVE · TRY Enhanced · AusTraits)

Purpose: surface species with enough quantitative information to support downstream trait synthesis. Each WFO-backed taxon qualifies if it meets any of the following:

- **≥3 numeric EIVE indices**
- **≥3 numeric TRY Enhanced traits**
- **≥3 numeric AusTraits overlap traits** (`leaf_area`, `leaf_N_per_dry_mass`, `leaf_mass_per_area`, `plant_height`, `diaspore_dry_mass`, `wood_density`, `leaf_dry_matter_content`, `leaf_thickness`)

A filtered AusTraits parquet (`data/stage1/austraits/traits_try_overlap.parquet`) provides the trait subset aligned with TRY, and `austraits_taxa_worldflora_enriched.parquet` supplies the WFO join.

### Outputs

- `data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_candidates.parquet`

### Coverage Summary

- Shortlisted species: **24 542** WFO taxa
- Qualified via ≥3 EIVE numeric indices: **12 610** taxa
- Qualified via ≥3 TRY Enhanced numeric traits: **12 658** taxa
- Qualified via ≥3 AusTraits numeric traits: **3 849** taxa
- Cross-condition overlap breakdown:
  - EIVE ∩ TRY ∩ AusTraits: **104**
  - EIVE ∩ TRY only: **3 038**
  - EIVE ∩ AusTraits only: **27**
  - TRY ∩ AusTraits only: **1 302**
  - EIVE only: **9 441**
  - TRY only: **8 214**
  - AusTraits only: **2 416**
- AusTraits numeric coverage (distinct trait dimensions per species across the eight aligned traits):  
  - 1 trait: 1 189 species  
  - 2 traits: 306 species  
  - 3 traits: 1 049 species  
  - 4 traits: 1 126 species  
  - 5 traits: 890 species  
  - 6 traits: 444 species  
  - 7 traits: 318 species  
  - 8 traits: 22 species  
  → yields **3 849** species with ≥3 distinct numeric AusTraits traits, confirming the shortlist threshold.

Dataset presence among shortlisted taxa:

| Dataset flag | Species |
|--------------|--------:|
| In EIVE      | 12 637  |
| In TRY Enhanced | 16 853 |
| In Duke ethnobotany | 3 654 |
| In AusTraits overlap | 5 873 |

**Review deliverable:** the subset with ≥30 GBIF occurrences is exported as `data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet` (11 680 species) and serves as the canonical Stage 1 reference shortlist for Prof Shipley's review.

#### GBIF Occurrence Coverage

**Source data**: GBIF occurrence dataset enriched with WorldFlora taxonomy (see 1.1_Raw_Data_Preparation.md for full enrichment workflow).

**Pipeline flow**:
1. **GBIF enrichment** (Oct 17): `data/gbif/occurrence_plantae.parquet` (161K unique species, 70M occurrences) → WorldFlora matching → `data/gbif/occurrence_plantae_wfo.parquet` (adds 12 WFO columns including `wfo_taxon_id`)
2. **Count aggregation**: `rebuild_shortlists.py` (lines 248-284) counts occurrences by accepted `wfo_taxon_id`:
   ```python
   SELECT wfo_taxon_id,
          COUNT(*) AS gbif_occurrence_count,
          COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
                           AND decimalLongitude IS NOT NULL) AS gbif_georeferenced_count
   FROM occurrence_plantae_wfo.parquet
   GROUP BY wfo_taxon_id
   ```
   Outputs: `data/stage1/gbif_occurrence_counts_by_wfo.parquet` / `.csv`

3. **Shortlist merge**: LEFT JOIN with `stage1_shortlist_candidates` on `wfo_taxon_id` (COALESCE to 0 for species without GBIF records)
   - Adds: `gbif_occurrence_count`, `gbif_georeferenced_count`, `legacy_wfo_ids`
   - Outputs: `data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_with_gbif.parquet` (24,511 species)

4. **Filter ≥30**: `WHERE gbif_occurrence_count >= 30`
   - Output: `data/stage1/stage1_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet` (11,711 species)

**Coverage summary** (24,511 trait-rich taxa, post-fix):
- **11,711** species have ≥30 GBIF occurrences (median ≈ 360; 90th percentile ≈ 6.19k; max 167,396)
- **6,733** species fall between 1-29 occurrences
- **6,098** species currently lack GBIF records (GBIF often tracks genus-level only)

**Georeferenced coverage**: 11,710 taxa have ≥30 coordinate-bearing records, 6,731 have 1-29, 6,100 have none.

**Key design**: Counting by accepted WFO ID (not original GBIF names) ensures synonyms are deduplicated and occurrences aggregate under the correct accepted taxon concept.


`stage1_shortlist_candidates` retains per-taxon counts (`eive_numeric_count`, `try_numeric_count`, `austraits_numeric_count`) plus boolean flags indicating which condition(s) the species satisfied. With all identifiers promoted to their accepted WFO concepts, this remains the canonical Stage 1 shortlist for downstream trait synthesis and Stage 3 documentation.

Pairwise overlaps (non-exclusive):
- Duke ∩ EIVE: 1 677  
- Duke ∩ Mabberly: 105  
- EIVE ∩ Mabberly: 2  
- Multiple other combinations occur via TRY/AusTraits; **3 188** taxa appear in three or more datasets (driven mostly by TRY and AusTraits coverage).

### Notes

- The master union currently omits TRY trait records and AusTraits trait rows as standalone sources to avoid double-counting; both feed through their taxa tables.
- Next steps: incorporate additional datasets (GBIF, GloBI, etc.) using the same WFO ID join, then build Stage 1 composite tables for downstream modelling.

## Modelling Shortlist (EIVE Complete · TRY Numeric Depth)

Purpose: identify species ready for modelling runs—i.e., those with the **full five EIVE indices** present and **at least eight distinct non-categorical TRY traits** (counting both TRY Enhanced numeric summaries and TRY raw numeric measurements, after de-duplicating overlapping traits such as `LMA` vs `SLA`). AusTraits traits are intentionally excluded to keep the feature set consistent with TRY conventions.

### Outputs

- `data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist.parquet`
- `data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist.csv`

### Coverage Summary

- Species meeting both conditions: **1 273** WFO taxa
- With ≥8 numeric traits coming solely from TRY Enhanced: **22** taxa
- With traits sourced from both TRY Enhanced and TRY raw: **1 251** taxa
- With traits coming solely from TRY raw: **0** taxa (all require TRY Enhanced support to reach eight distinct traits)

Trait deduplication treats TRY raw `specific_leaf_area` as the inverse of TRY Enhanced `LMA (g/m²)`, and aligns `leaf_dry_matter_content`/`LDMC (g/g)` so each canonical numeric trait is counted once per species.

Total TRY numeric trait counts per species (post-deduplication):

| Distinct numeric traits | Species |
|-------------------------|--------:|
| 8 | 684 |
| 9 | 588 |
| 10 | 1 |

This “tight” modelling shortlist focuses entirely on TRY-sourced quantitative traits plus complete EIVE coverage, making it a ready-to-use roster for Stage 2/Stage 3 modelling experiments when richer trait breadth is required.

**Review deliverable:** `data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist_with_gbif_ge30.parquet` / `.csv` (1 084 species with ≥30 GBIF occurrences) is the checklist Prof Shipley will inspect for modelling readiness.

#### GBIF Occurrence Coverage

- The WFO-based rebuild attaches GBIF totals to the modelling shortlist (`data/stage1/stage1_modelling_shortlist_with_gbif.parquet`) with a ≥30-occurrence subset (`..._ge30.parquet`). The files also expose `legacy_wfo_ids` and `gbif_georeferenced_count`.
- Coverage summary (1 273 taxa total):
  - **1 084** species retain ≥30 occurrences (median ≈ 4.37 k; 90th percentile ≈ 30.1 k; max 167 562).
  - **39** species fall between 1 and 29 occurrences.
  - **150** species currently lack GBIF records (typically because GBIF only tracks the concept at genus level).

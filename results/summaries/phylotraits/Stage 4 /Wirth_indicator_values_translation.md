Source: Volkmar Wirth (2010) “Ökologische Zeigerwerte von Flechten – erweiterte und aktualisierte Fassung” (Herzogia 23: 229–248). PDF converted from `papers/Wirth-txt-EF.pdf` → `papers/mmd/Wirth-txt-EF.mmd` using the project Mathpix pipeline.

The paper publishes updated Ellenberg-style indicator scales for 516 Central European lichen species. Each axis is ordinal; even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) represent intermediate classes. Below is an English rendering of the German definitions for the most relevant axes (light, temperature, continentality, moisture, reaction/pH, nutrient enrichment). The temperature scale is explicitly defined (values 1–9).

## Light (L)
- **1** – Deep-shade species; still present at <1 % relative illumination and only rarely above 10 %.
- **2** – Intermediate between 1 and 3.
- **3** – Shade species; mostly at <5 % relative illumination.
- **4** – Intermediate between 3 and 5.
- **5** – Semi-shade species; usually above 10 % relative illumination, seldom in full light.
- **6** – Intermediate between 5 and 7.
- **7** – Half-light species; mostly in full light but also occurring in the shade.
- **8** – Light-demanding species; only exceptionally at <40 % relative illumination.
- **9** – Full-light species; only in full sun, rarely below 50 % relative illumination.

## Temperature (T)
- **1** – Cold indicator; mostly in high mountain belts, alpine–nival or arctic–boreal distributions.
- **2** – Between 1 and 3; alpine species often descending into the subalpine zone.
- **3** – Cool indicator; primarily subalpine and high montane.
- **4** – Between 3 and 5; chiefly in rather cool places, mainly montane.
- **5** – Mainly in moderately cool to moderately warm situations; often montane–submontane; distribution typically reaches mid Fennoscandia.
- **6** – Mainly submontane/colline but also in mild montane sites; in northern regions still within the deciduous forest belt of Fennoscandia; seldom beyond southern Sweden or the southernmost Finland (up to the range limit of pedunculate oak).
- **7** – Warm indicator; chiefly colline; in the north the range limit is in northern Germany/Denmark or, at most, reaches the mildest southern parts of Scandinavia.
- **8** – Warm indicator; centered in the sub-Mediterranean/Mediterranean region; occurs on strongly sun-exposed warm sites but often extends into montane elevations.
- **9** – Extreme warmth indicator; only extending from the Mediterranean/sub-Mediterranean core into southern to central parts of Central Europe.

## Continentality (K)
- **1** – Eu-atlantic; only with a few eastern outposts in western/southwestern/northwestern Central Europe.
- **2** – Atlantic; centered in Western Europe (including western Central Europe); in eastern neighboring countries restricted to a few favorable sites.
- **3** – Between 2 and 4; scattered to sporadic occurrences in relatively mild locations across much of Central Europe.
- **4** – Sub-atlantic; throughout Central Europe, thinning out eastwards.
- **5** – Intermediate; either widespread from Western Europe to Siberia, or concentrated in Central Europe but less frequent in West/East Europe.
- **6** – Widespread from Western to Eastern Europe, extending deep into continental Asia (e.g., boreal conifer forest taxa).
- **7** – Sub-continental; rare or absent in Western Europe (British Isles, western France).
- **8** – Continental; core distribution in Eastern Europe; in Central Europe only on special sites.
- **9** – Continental; absent from Central Europe proper.

## Moisture (F)
- **1** – Restricted to the driest situations.
- **2** – Strongly favoring low-precipitation sites (annual rainfall <750 mm).
- **3** – Tolerating low precipitation but often present in moist locations as well.
- **4** – Occurring also at low-precipitation sites but only where air humidity is high.
- **5** – Usually avoiding dry regions; rainfall typically >700 mm.
- **6** – Rainfall usually >800 mm.
- **7** – Generally confined to fairly high-precipitation regions; rainfall mostly >1000 mm.
- **8** – Typically in very rainy regions (>1400 mm) yet capable of withstanding some desiccation.
- **9** – Generally in very humid regions (>1400 mm) at extremely moist sites; lichens dry out only briefly.

## Reaction / Substrate pH (R)
- **1** – Strongly acid substrates only.
- **2** – Between 1 and 3.
- **3** – Mainly on acid substrates but occasionally near neutral.
- **4** – Between 3 and 5.
- **5** – Moderately acid substrates; occasionally on very acid or neutral/basic substrates.
- **6** – Between 5 and 7.
- **7** – Weakly acid to weakly basic substrates; absent from very acid surfaces.
- **8** – Between 7 and 9.
- **9** – Basic reaction; exclusively calcareous or otherwise high-pH substrates.

## Nutrient / Eutrophication (N)
- **1** – Extremely infertile sites.
- **2** – Between 1 and 3.
- **3** – More or less infertile sites.
- **4** – Between 3 and 5.
- **5** – Intermediately fertile sites.
- **6** – Between 5 and 7.
- **7** – Frequently on richly fertile sites.
- **8** – Between 7 and 9.
- **9** – Extremely nutrient-rich situations (e.g., livestock resting areas, polluted river margins).

## Notes
- Hill et al. (1999) omitted temperature, but Wirth (2010) provides an explicit **T scale** for lichens (values 1–9). Although the context is lichen ecology, the structure mirrors the classic Ellenberg temperature classes and can inform cross-checks for vascular plant T values.
- Additional sections in the paper describe moisture definitions tailored to poikilohydric lichens, the derivation of a climate-oceanity index (KO), and the full species table (L, T, K, F, R, N, substrate code). See `papers/mmd/Wirth-txt-EF.mmd` for the complete OCR output.

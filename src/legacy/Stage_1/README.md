# Stage 1 Legacy Scripts

Scripts in this directory were part of earlier Stage 1 pipelines but are no longer referenced by the 2025-10 canon documentation. They are retained for archival purposes only; new runs should rely on the scripts documented in `results/summaries/hybrid_axes/phylotraits/Stage_1/` (files prefixed `1.*`).

Contents are grouped by their original module (Data_Extraction, Sampling, Soil). No further maintenance is planned.

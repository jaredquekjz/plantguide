# Stage 5: Validation

This folder will contain scripts for model validation and prediction accuracy assessment.

## Planned Components:

### 1. Cross-Validation
- k-fold CV for prediction accuracy
- Leave-one-family-out validation
- Geographic cross-validation

### 2. External Validation
- Test on non-EIVE European species
- Compare with expert knowledge
- Validate against field measurements

### 3. Prediction Outputs
- Generate EIVE predictions for all species
- Uncertainty quantification
- Create planting guide recommendations

## Success Metrics:
- RÂ² for continuous EIVE values
- Classification accuracy for categorical indicators
- Coverage of prediction intervals

## Deliverables:
- Predicted EIVE values for species without expert scores
- Confidence intervals for predictions
- Model performance statistics
